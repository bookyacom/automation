  "artist_bio": "Barish is one of Turkey's leading djs, hosting three different weekly shows @ Dinamo 103.8 (www.dinamo.fm) which he is also in charge of music directing. He is also the resident Dj of Crobar BoraMusic HouseCast, a two time IDMA nominated house music podcast with guest DJ mixes and interviews from the world's top DJs. Always looking ahead, he tries to break boundaries with his genre defying variations, building up a dedicated crowd all around.\r\n\r\nBarish is a dedicated music lover, and an established dj. His passion for music began with his long escapades into the world of R'n'b and Soul. While studying architectural engineering at the University of Hartford, his mad nights during the early times of Twilo made him fall in love with electronic music and its performance.  \r\n\r\nAfter graduation, he moved to New York for business opportunities and that's where his dj'ing career took off.  After winning a mixing competition held by New York City’s DJ Mark Divine (Sound Factory), Barish secured himself two local weekly residencies at the Leopard Lounge and Liquids sharing the booth respectively with Mark Divine (D3) and Julio Terra (MuzakTherapy). \r\n\r\nAfter returning to his native country , Barish quickly became a resident at Turkey’s most prestigious clubs such as Crystal, Nuclub and Underground.  During this time Barish has become one of the principal member DJs of the highly regarded “Together” crew notably comprising international house talents such as Yunus Guvenen, Subsky, & Muzo B. His evergrowing ‘Wet’n’Juicee’ nights at NuClub had been a landmark for house music lovers in the past few years and his recent residencies at Club Clinic and Multidance has been making a great impact, not to mention his opening performance for François K at Istanbul’s Surmeli, an extended set at Dinamo’s Radar Live Festival.and his recent performance at Arro Dance, Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nBarish has been DJ’ing with a pious dedication since early 2000 and his hard work is felt in his key mixing abilities and exceptional track selection. He is known by his friends as one of the most disciplined and motivated Dj in the country, nothing can tear him apart from the booth not even a broken leg! His blend of unique sounds, unprejudiced genre defying variations and rather hypnotic approach has caught the attention of IDJ magazine, which commented his set with great review in the Readers’ Mixes Section on May 2003 issue.  Barish has started to host for 34 BPM shows on the internet’s leading dance broadcast Proton Radio after his brilliant guest mixes and his sets also appeared on selected radio servers such as Mercurysessions, Musicserver.uk, Frisky, etc.\r\n\r\nBarish has been performing around the US and eastern Europe for the last few years including \r\n- Miami (Proton Radio Party w/Subsky, Dinamo Party  w/ Fuchs, Joshua Collins.., Red Flag Collective & Angora Records’ Collaborative party w/ Ozgur Can, Astro&Glyde..) \r\n- New York (Swamy’s Sunday night party at Le Souk w/ Astro & Glyde, Loft’n’Space Party at Robots)\r\n- Hartford (Red Flag Collective Release Party w/ Yunus)\r\n- Bulgaria (Arro Dance, Life House & Comics Club)\r\n- Poland (Piekarnia, Klatka & Mandragora)\r\n- Romania (Kristal Club)\r\n- Hungary (Dokk Club - Red Flag Collective Release Party w/ Yunus)\r\n- Russia (live performance with Burhan Öçal at Turquality Fashion Project at Moscow’s Music House) \r\n\r\nBarish and Muzo B’s collaborative project, a Digweed favorite “Adequate Medication”, was first spotted at Sasha&Digweed Coloursfest ’03 radio set and released on December through Red Flag Collective, a record label he started with Yunus Güvenen, Subsky and Muzo B being responsible for label's promotion and also working as the A&R Coordinator along with Subsky.  Barish and Muzo’s other monstrous project ‘Intra-Venous’ took place on Digweed’s September ’05 Chart and got released through their digital platform.\r\n\r\nBarish is the music director at Istanbul’s independent electronic music station Dinamo 103.8 (www.dinamo.fm).

The production/dj duo are inspired from an interesting cross-section of styles including multiple musical worlds such as, Minimal Techno and House, elements of Rock and Funk, and even the oriental character and diversity of Turkish Music. As a live act, the duo incorporate a cool and energetic mix of underlying dance grooves with live electronics,..Members:\r\n\r\nDj Beyza\r\n\r\nSince 1997, Beyza has been at the forefront of the electronic music scene in her hometown of Istanbul, Turkey.

Her trips as a professional DJ have not only taken her to venues all over Turkey, but help her stretch as far as France, Cyprus, Germany, Austria, Romania, Georgia, Bulgaria, Ukrania, Polland and the US. From small intimate clubs and larger beach parties to massive New Year's Events, Beyza has only begun to accomplish the vision she has set forth.

Ion's sound is exactly like looking into a shattered mirror where you can see different angles. Finding the world; 'the system' too plain and ordinary to attach in, as the sole reality, she thinks about things noone can't see and uses her abstract imagination to dream up new worlds.

Looking beyond what is seen into what things could come. Ion's sound is exactly like looking into a shattered mirror where you can see different angles. Finding the world; 'the system' too plain and ordinary to attach in, as the sole reality, she thinks about things noone can't see and uses her abstract imagination to dream up new worlds. She represents her inner thoughts and feelings with her tones, exhibiting colorful and varied sounds characterized by her order, progression, mentality and symmetry combined with her keen understanding of music and a style of sound shaping.\r\n\r\nHer expressions usually focused on making people to feel \"the moment\", to dance and loose themselves in the catchy mental melodies comprising sharper sounds, progressive build ups and a flow to ride. Targeted to make people have their own inner journeys, Ion likes to create unique sound palettes for every different concept that she works. Aimed to reach the best possible build up and the most emotionally accelerated arrangement, her high frequency ranges usually works as a sunlight reflected to her dark lower range. Performances are strictly eclectic and groovy, constructed to impose powerful emotions to the audience. Stories hidden in her musical constructions, both at stage and in her records, lies in the inductive comprehension from the beginning to the end, and should be treated as a feature-movie script.\r\n\r\nCatchy melodies and progressive build ups.. Somewhat acrid.. Sharp, not stuttering, but flowing.. Ranging anywhere between Minimal-Tech and Techno worlds. Denise Ion's music is definitely emotional, and designed to move people in both emotional and literal ways. She loves to work on themes like psychology, machineries, cosmology, biological fluxes, philosophy, science and technology. She likes to feel that she understands and probes deeply into a subject to get as good an insight as possible, open minded in to new ideas. \r\n\r\nOn being innovative and experimental, which are quite relative subjects in EDM so as in art, she believes in an aesthetic balance between eccentric experimentalism and a solid dance groove. As musical trends change perpetually, she is excluding herself from being a certain sound trend setter. Instead, she has great appreciation and enough place inside her to embrace different visions. She finds it binding attaching to a certain specific kind of sound, with a mind with overflowing ideas. Ion loves to blend them in her own style and enjoys looking to the bigger picture as one of the many transformers in EDM. That's also the reason why she is called as the 'label mom'. \r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nSince she's the only child of a lyric soprano singer/songwriter mother with several EPs and LPs from late 70s and early 80s, she grew with music. Inherently caught in the frenzy of Michael Jackson that her mother made her listen through her pregnancy abdomen before Denise was born. In 90s her musical choices were names like Nine Inch Nails, Daft Punk, Faithless and Marilyn Manson.\r\n\r\nThe exact moment that she led by her passion for EDM, was the time when she listened to Josh Wink's epic \"Don't Laugh\" for the first time, and solidified with the renowned Radio 2019 of Istanbul, which has quite an impact on the birth of the EDM scene in 90s Turkey. Thankfully it was the Turkish legend in millenniums early stages, the Switch Club in Istanbul, which gave her the urge to dig deeper on the dance floor. After the very sad confinement of the club, she was determined to take a step further. \r\n\r\nFrom that moment in 2004, she has devoted herself to electronic dance music and she has appeared in numerous clubs, placed for festivals with names like Marilyn Manson, Groove Armada, Ellen Allien & Apparat, Kelis, Radioslave, Jamie Lidell, Booka Shade and so on to this day. Starting with the residency at Dogzstar in 2004, the doors opened and she played almost in every club and had several dj and producer projects ('Tuuce' 2003-2005, 'FA' duo project with Clone Kent 2005-2009 and ultimately Denise Ion from 2010 to present). To name the most noticeable ones; 'Auf' (Taylan Yilmaz) which played a leading role between 2005-2007 techno scene in Turkey with guests like Akufen, Christian Fischer, Dinky, M-in, Onur Ozer, Patrick Bateman, Savas Pascalidis, Seth Throxler, Tigerskin aka Dub Taylor and also the famous Indigo Club which was also legendary between 2005-2007 with such guests as Dave Clarke, Carl Craig, Richie Hawtin, Steve Bug, Gregor Tresher, Sven Vath, Alex Metric, Ambivalent, Ricardo Villalobos, Karotte, Alex Smoke, Onur Ozer, Italoboyz, Jennifer Cardini, André Galuzzi, Alex Flatner, Tobi Neumann, Monika Kruse and so on. For all others; Karakoy Liman, Lokal, Balans Tonique, Secret, Machine, MKZ Beach Party, Radar Live Festival 2007, Dirty and Smood would be the bests to name. After several club closings in 2009, she started playing at private parties made rarely at warehouses or cellars and organizing showcases for Redukt label.\r\n\r\nFinding out that one can not be contented with only DJing when contaminated with EDM, as it was just the tip of the iceberg, studying Sound Production/Music Business was the second best thing that happened after her abrupt acquaintance with Clone Kent. By the beginning of her studies, a partnership has surfaced with Clone Kent and they started out a duo production and performance project named 'FA' in 2005. Until 2009, they made two albums and EPs, performed 10-channel mixes on stage and they grew mature in both music and stage. Denise that time, affected by Richie Hawtin's intelligent build ups and progressions, was also impressed by substantial composers like Jerry Goldsmith and Danny Elfman.\r\n\r\nAfter the completion of the duo project, they have not only continued their partnership, but moved even further. They wanted to make their own contributions to the never-ending transformation of EDM, ending up with a desire to have and conduct a brand and in late 2009, they have founded Redukt label. Since that time, Ion is working together with a group of friends, deciding Redukt's inclinations on music, growing fanbase with solid releases and organizing label showcases to a multitude of enthusiasts. She has worked with (or still working with) labels like, Frucht (Berlin), Machine Box Music (Cabarete), Eye Records (Milan), Fourth Kind (Michigan), Volt9 (Utrecht), Hero In My Hood (Bayern).",

After He worked on underground as a Hip-Hop and produced his own song, he realized House Music in 2009. At the begining, He was a good listener of House Music but then he thought that he should try and make that music. After all of these, He worked on Progressive House and Electro House in addition to House Music. With his these works , He gained appreciation of his close friends and successful producers. From 2011 till now, He took the so many stages. In a period of his working life, He joined the competition of Power FM and proved his success in music.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, He actualised ,blazing a trail, the project of HouseBro which has become the only and first music platform in Turkey.

On the air, DJ Burax not only creates the music but also is dancing in the crowd, unlike most of his other colleagues. Burax's signature characteristic is the ability to surprise his crowd with the choice of song conglomeration. The audience never knows what they are going to get. In 2008, Burax started his career in Music Production. One of his first known hits was: Are You Gonna Go My Way from Lenny Kravitz.

  "artist_bio": "“I want people to dance to my music with their eyes closed.  I want them to fly into the world of sophisticated senses, and besides hearing the music, I want them touch, smell, taste, and watch it.  It’s all about dense senses.  My tracks are generally about the world of darkness. Not evil, but a magical obscurity, like the night, that consists of hidden, epic stories that spread energy slowly and rhythmically.  I’m trying to put a spell on those who hear the music and transcend them to a place of calm euphoria.” – Clone Kent\r\nMystical, dark, infectious, provocative, and progressive, the music of artist Clone Kent provides an uncommon experience.  Upon hearing the first hypnotic beats of this artist’s Minimal Techno masterpieces, fans are transported to realm of mystery and secrets that allows them to release their inhibitions, dive in, and lose themselves in the music.  \r\n\r\nBorn in 1978 in Ankara, Turkey as Kaan Turkyilmaz, Clone Kent was genetically designed to make great music.  Growing up in a family of music-lovers, he studied piano, trumpet, and composing during his childhood, a time when he discovered his passion for music.  These early classical influences would later merge with a curiosity and affinity for his father’s Jupiter-8 and CR-78 electronic machines.  Blending those influences with others of pop and rock icons like Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Pink Floyd along with 80s electronic dance pioneers such as S-Express, M.A.R.R.S., and Technotronic gave life to the distinctive Clone Kent sounds audiences hear today.\r\n\r\nIn early 2004, desiring a greater inspiration for the music growing inside of him and richer club scene, he moved to Istanbul and launched “Fino Attack,” a production and performance project with friend Denise Ion.  Their first non-commercial album “Synthoxica,” which intermingled kitsch electro sounds of the 80s with analogue themes, was released in March 2006.  After a short time, in the fall of 2006, the second acid-electro album \"Elektrolyted\" was released from English fair play label BeatPick Music, and another release “i-Kontrol” was simultaneously released from Canadian label Bugeyed Records. During this time, the duo performed ten channel live electro and techno mixes in many of the hottest nightclubs in Turkey, which enhanced their exposure and made them wildly popular on the local club scene.  In 2008, Turkyilmaz began producing music with a more seasoned and sophisticated artistic perspective, and Clone Kent was born.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, Clone Kent and Ion began their own label, Redukt, which aims to test the creative boundaries of the techno arena with its wealth of fresh, new talent and their strikingly unique sounds.\r\n\r\nWith the goal of bringing the most exclusive, high quality Minimal Techno music to the world and becoming a positive force in the industry by merging musical intelligence, visual arts, intensive artistic collaboration, and quite simply, creating great dance music, Clone Kent continues to co-host Reduktiv Radio Show, produce remixes for other artists, and develop his own, innovative musical creations.\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Batu Celik was born in Istanbul in 1987 just before the digitization of music.Batu Celik was born in Istanbul in 1987 just before the digitization of music. He spent his childhood by haunting records, turntables, stereos and casettes outside the daily stuffs done by a child. \r\n\r\nYears ago, while he was dealing with the stereo, both cassettes suddenly began to ring and he realized that two tracks can be played at the same time. Despite the fact that he’s tried to mix the tracks randomly, he just made noise, nothing more. But he was not content with this and he had some sctrach experiments with a turntable which belongs his father.\r\n\r\nHe lived exactly the effect of electronic music on people and danced with a euro-pop style track that he listened when he was a child and never found the name of it.\r\n\r\nAgain, years ago, Batu went back to home after a night which one of his schoolmates invited him to his home and taught him how to use cd player and mixer. When he laid in bed and closed his eyes, he started to think about the image of Dj Setup and the things which can be made with that. He was so impressed.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, he started to organize his own parties to illustrate the performance of his own music in the clubs. His effort about this has worked and he started to play in the clubs without his own organizations.\r\n\r\nBesides of performing actively in various cities and clubs of Turkey, he started to get weaving to production which is his ‘main priority’. And he made this with the ideas and suggestions from a musician that we called Ahmet Sendil and he called ‘My Teacher’.\r\n\r\nAfter this magic touch, he succeeded to release his first extended play album, ‘’Instant Reaction EP’’ , from an important and valuable record company of Spain, My Little Dog Records.\r\n\r\nBatu Celik made two beautiful surprises in summer of 2011. He gave two tracks to the two different compilation albums and he took his own place in the music stores of Spain and Turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe adopted a sentence as the ideology of him -‘’not everyone understands house music’’- from a legend track which belongs Eddie Amador and called ‘House Music’. And his proximity to the house music became stronger.\r\n\r\nNowadays, he continues to his musical works determinedly. And his sets are based on the partnership between the deep house and tech house.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.beatport.com/artist/batu-celik/178316",

His family's interest in music has played a great role on the growth of his love for music. In 1985, his family decided to move to Istanbul and Tarkan had continued playing his vinyls and recording tapes after he was coming back home from his school. \r\nHis professional music career started after finishing university, when he became a resident at Power FM. Right after showing up in the music scene as a radio dj, he started to perform at the biggest clubs in Istanbul. Running fast in his music career, he had to give a short break to complete his military service between April-November 1997. \r\n\r\nUpon his return to Istanbul, he took scene at “Radio 2019” as a DJ and Production Manager while he was performing at different clubs in Istanbul. After the radio station was sold to a TV channel and changed its genre, DJ Tarkan continued playing his radio sets at FG till May 2007. His reputation in Turkey was spreading and the number of people appreciating his sound increasing with every event. The big break came in 2002 with the DJ of the Year award. \r\n\r\nTarkan was sponsored to play his eclectic house sets, which he sharply forms depending on the time, the venue and the crowd, all around the country. His unique mixing style cemented his fan-base around the country, where he is frequently invited to play gigs in different cities. His creativity and talent was appreciated by the crowds and he was named number one DJ in Turkey for 3 consecutive years. \r\n\r\n\r\nBased on this success, DJ Tarkan decided to spend more time on productions, releasing tracks based on years of musical experience. His productions and remixes were included in the tracklists and charts of the world's well known dj's like Tiesto, Paul Oakenfold, Armin van Buuren, Sasha, Hernan Cattaneo, Nick Warren, Deep Dish, Sander Kleinenberg, Anthony Pappa, Dave Seaman, Danny Howells, Steve Lawler, Seb Fontaine, Lee Burridge, Desyn Masiello and many more. \r\n\r\nThe momentum continued with bookings from different countries all over the world and in 2006, DJ Tarkan was voted Number 78 in the world by DJ Magazine's most important poll in dance music. \r\n\r\nWhile doing collaborative productions, Tarkan became close friends with V-SAG from Greece. Both went on tours together and the Turkish-Greek friendship resulted in the No Smoking Recordings label, which is intended to only release the highest standard of deep, tribal and progressive house music. DJ Tarkan and V-Sag have initiated a campaign for the understanding of the music \"as is\", giving people the opportunity to discover the true meaning of music in its purest form instead of \"chemically enhanced fun\". \r\n\r\nFor more info check: www.nosmokingrecordings.com/\r\n\r\nIn December 2005, DJ Tarkan became a monthly residency at Frisky Radio which is the leading internet dance radio station for independent producers.",

Shortly after that he began to perform regularly in bars, clubs, events and festivals.\r\n\r\nIn 2007 Janbaz divided his time between his employment and passion and produced his first release called \"Still Growing\". The 2008 follow up was the “Kommunicate” album released on his label, Zey Productions. He finds inspiration in producers like Aphex Twin, Ilhan Mimaroglu, Ricardo Villalobos and Alex Smoke. Although he uses a lot of techno, minimal, idm, glitch, blip and experimental elements in his music, electronica is still the closest to Janbaz’s heart.\r\n\r\nJanbaz and producer friend Burcu Gokmen have set up a new label called Zey Productions in order to feature their own tracks, as well as tracks from the hottest artists in Turkey and around the globe. The label is focusing on releasing tracks by respectable artists in the intelligent dance scene.",

By sharing ideas, they've built up a common sense on their sound. After a very short time, “Fino Attack” as a production project was started. They’ve unofficially released four synth-electro tracks on their digitally recorded Demo EP from their home studio in August 2005. With an exclusive 2006 new year performance, they’ve began to perform live electronic music. At the begining of March 2006, the first attack has made: \"Synthoxica - the Album\" which circulates 80's synth logic by merging kitsch electro & minimal sounds with analog sounds. Synthoxica has 13 varied tracks that reflect Fino Attack's never-ending journey at musical trip. This non-commercial album has a different point of view that forms a diversity from the other projects of FA.\r\n \r\nIn April 2006, Fino Attack’s radio show “ElectroStethoscope” has started on Turkey’s leading event organization / radio station Dinamo FM 103.8 (www.dinamo.fm). Fino Attack bound every saturday night to sundays with “ElectroStethoscope”. And, excellent mix links editorialized by Jon Spooner has chosen one of these performances as his pick at Blentwell (www.blentwell.com). Talented top dj’s like Misstress Barbara, Mark Romboy, Stephan Bodzin, Digitalism, Kiki, Monosurround etc., spinned their latest mixes for ElectroStethoscope as guest. “Circle of Cycle” Video Clip released on July 2006 and downloadable from Fino Attack’s web site. Their second album “Elektrolyted” happened as a result of a continious production concept which supports FA’s live performances. It presents a range between minimal electro and electro-techno with acidic and glitchy sounds. The album released out from the fairplay music label from England; BeatPick in fall, 2006 (www.beatpick.com). In November 2006, Fino Attack’s “iKontrol (The Grudge Attack Remix) released from the Canadian label; BugEyed Recordings (www.bugeyedrecorgins.com). At 2008 their two remixes for Clone Kent’s “Heavy Cat” & “Scodi” released from Jean Records (www.jeanrecords.co.uk).\r\n\r\nFino Attack’s live sound consists of multi channel djing of their own music and other artist’s tracks, drag & drop sessions, loop mixing and special fx control. They have performed at many jammy night clubs in several cities in Turkey.\r\n",

Born in the hubbub of cosmopolitan Istanbul where Asia meets Europe across the vast Bosphorous River, Irmak's rise to the higher echelons of the musical elite is as rapid as it is impressive.Thoroughly immersed in the sounds of his Turkish homeland from an early age, a combination of \"psychedelic and chilled out Eastern sounds\" became the fundamental tenets of a musical ideology that has brought success across a wide spectrum of labels and genres. Proficient in deep, tech and progressive house, a further foray into electronica and techno has seen the development of a prolific talent.A veritable feast of original and remix music to his name, Irmak has seen labels such as Movement and Lowbit find favour with his inimitable style. Furthermore, a score of production credits across Stripped Recordings, Stripped Digital and Hype Musik has seen his talents recognised by the renowned StrippedMusikClub, further seeing his music released on the trio of imprints. A clutch of new and original material for Particles has seen Irmak's star rise higher in the progressive house firmament as the, \"In The Middle of the Night\" and \"Start Believing\" EPs showcased his talent.

The disturbed personality of Gunes allowed him to experiment with different styles of electronic music such as DnB, jungle and dubstep.\r\nIn summer of 2012, when he met Childplay and Coskun from Gecko Chamber and heard their music, his genre changed again to minimal deep/tech house. Since then he has been playing alongside Gecko Chamber and Childplay on the label Simplastique at different clubs in Istanbul. However, his passion for dubstep/drumstep/dnb/trap got him bookings in Babylon's dubstep nights and private events. Nowadays he's combining his knowledge about dub, house and his design discipline to conjure a new fusion of sounds, noises and planar leads and groovy sequential basslines.",

  "artist_bio": "Emir Hazir\r\n\r\nTechno Dj/Producer/Remix/EngineerThough Turkey may seem like an unlikely place for Techno, following in the tradition of fellow countrymen Len Faki and Butch; it is the home of a true hidden gem in Emir Hazir. Starting his career in music as a DJ at a popular turkish radio station, he discovered the world of production through a chance encounter with some analog gear at a friend's house in 2004. He immediately fell in love and the rest is history. Emir eventually moved onto software and spent the following years teaching himself how to produce by studying manuals, tutorials, and music as he gradually learned and refined his sound. His diligence paid off and Emir finally released his first EP, the formidable “Come Closer EP” on Feierkind Records in 2011. Since then Emir Hazir hasn't looked back, leaving a long trail of releases on Black Brook Ltd, Login Records, Hit Musik, Terminus Audio and many more. Though Emir may joke about his english being dodgy – his music is anything but. Emir Hazir has a cerebral approach to his productions – esoteric and effective; every polished sound has a purpose with an extreme attention to detail. An in-demand producer and remixer, his tracks have found their way into the hands of Stevie Wilson, Paul Blauth, Ideal Flow, Marika Rossa, Marcus Reichel, Monktec, Herbert He, Brett Hit, Peat Noise, Stephan Koenigk, AudioDistraction and more. Now aligning himself with Terminus Audio and Management, Emir will no doubt be making a serious impact on the terrain of techno in the months and years to come.\r\n\r\nBooking / Info / Remix, send mail to terminusaudio@gmail.com",

An Istanbul-based DJ and producer, he started his DJing career in 2000 playing at various venues and events, (Soho, Taps, Maksim,New Yorker etc.) mostly focused on electronica. His interest in house music started to grow in 2003, when he became a resident at Anjelique and Wan-na, the most prominent nightclubs in Istanbul. The year after, as he took over the sole residency, his sets progressed towards deep, tech and progressive house filled with emotional structure. More recently, he was behind the Sounds of Anjelique projects, compiling and mixing six volumes of compilation albums that recall the excitement and high energy of his sets.\r\nAs a producer, his carefully chosen sounds drive towards slowly evolving arrangements with a sense of dark melodies and chords supported by heavy basslines. Mostly influenced by his brother, Doruk Cihan, Bob James, Arthur Baker, Nick Warren, Jimpster and Gui Boratto, the deep and powerful story in his tracks unfolds with driving beats and rich melodies.\r\nWith a diverse taste in music, his unique sets have not only changed the sound in the venues he plays at, but also placed him among the very few who succeed in transforming the music scene in Istanbul. Having shared decks with Nick Warren, Satoshi Tomiie, Dave Seamen, Lee Burridge, Hernan Cattaneo, François K, Danny Howells, Behrouz, Sharam and Andy Caldwell among others, Dogus Cihan still holds his residency at Anjelique while he’s working on his productions and playing on FG Radio every Thursday between 24.00 - 01.00am (GMT+2)\r\nDogus Cihan stands out with his musical knowledge as he studied music in Istanbul Bilgi University and still running his label \"keepitpure music\" with Mert Eser.",

Applying it to a traditional society, however, was the real challenge. \r\n\r\nAfter completing high school, Uncuoglu started working at CD LAND, importing foreign LPs and the first CDs to Istanbul. Collecting a vast knowledge of the current dance music, he was approached with offers to DJ at private parties. In 1987, he began accepting the offers, and started his DJ’ing career. Soon his first residency, at Bodrum Hadigari, followed. \r\n\r\nUncuoglu’s career took a professional turn when his success at Hadigari caught the attention of the owner of Pasha Istanbul and he was immediately recruited to the club. Before long, his name became simultaneous with Pasha as he transformed the club’s music scene to match that of the best in Europe.\r\n\r\nHis ever-increasing urge to become a professional DJ and producer, took Uncuoglu to what was then the heart of electronic music, London. During the day, he studied sound engineering and production at London’s Media Productions. At night, he conducted field research in London’s legendary clubs.        \r\n\r\nWhile there, he met international producers including Marshall Jefferson (Chicago) and BAM BAM (Chicago) and worked as their engineers at various studios. It was not long before he was DJ’ing in exclusive parties and local clubs.\r\n\r\nUpon his return to Istanbul in 1994, he embarked upon multiple projects. Consequently, he was recruited as the resident DJ at Club 2019, Istanbul’s legendary underground club. Simultaneously, Uncuoglu embarked on his most memorable project, the co-founding of Radio 2019, the first dance music radio station in Turkey. Thus, the first steps towards placing Istanbul on the club culture’s international map were taken. \r\n\r\nUncuoglu has been the resident DJ at 7th House and Switch, the top two clubs in Istanbul, not to mention hosting  DJs  such as Sasha,John Digweed, Max Graham, Dave Seaman, Lemon8, Kasey Taylor,  Breeder , Phil Thomson .\r\n\r\nHaving attained national stardom and respect by both his fans and colleagues, Murat Uncuoglu has turned his attention to the international music scene. \r\n\r\n\r\nHe  did  a  special   guest  mix  show     for  JOHN DIGWEEDS  KISS FM   on  02/ nov/202.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the events he played at are listed below:\r\n\r\n-J&B 1.

Even though their tastes in music differed in genre prior to their companionship they used the chemistry that appeared when they met to create an individualistic spirit in their music. While Ahmet is more inclined to use deeper and more emotional sounds, Ege always puts more emphasis on rhythmic sounds that make the listeners want to move and the combination of these sounds is the only thing not regular about these two.Contact: regularpeoplemusic@gmail.com",

  "artist_bio": "Onur Ozer is a minimal techno DJ resident in Istanbul, Turkey.Ozer began his career in the late nineties when minimal and tech-house were making a resurgence in Istanbul.\r\n\r\nIn a city oppressed by both a stifling heat and a musical style equally as stagnant, Onur helped battle to change the old rules and break old habits, breathing fresh life into a dispirited club scene. Armed with his vinyl case, still dressed in his shabby student clothes, he entered the clubs to share his biggest passion, dancing without reason. \r\n\r\nOnur continued to fight the cause and helped found a number of new, vanguard venues, bringing new sounds and styles to Turkey’s capital.\r\n\r\nIn 2002 he began to export this warm Istanbul sound to different cities in Germany. Since then he has kept the crowds dancing in such venues as Robert Johnson, Harry Klein, Studio 672 and Kerosin.\r\n\r\n2004 witnessed a turning point in his career and he became the resident DJ of the highly-rated party series Sweet Sense, welcoming many international acts.\r\n\r\nIn 2005 he began to take his already well-honed musical talents into the studio, releasing his debut EP ‘Freakdisco’ on Freude-Am-Tanzen in August. Another ‘Envy EP’ on Vakant the following month. Germany’s Groove Magazine rated him as one of their up and comers of the year.\r\n\r\n2006 will see his next EP release on Vakant ‘Twilight’ out mid-March.\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Bookings & Management \r\ninfo@mehmetakar.comMehmet Akar is an independent electronic music producer/Dj from Turkey. His creative streak began in the mid 90s, but not in the music field. Turntables, vinyls and headphones were not a part of his childhood toys as this is the story with most Dj's around the world, but rather, his artistic ability manifested in the drawing field of comic strips and cartoons. \r\n\r\nHe began his creation with music in the early days of 2010, while studying at a university. His first set got recognized and broadcasted by Frisky Radio which scored him a monthly residency with the team. Soon after in a short period of time, Mehmet started working on his own productions where his first tracks got released by well known labels and got the support of many top Dj's around the world. Soon in the years following, Mehmet got a chance to play outside of his country and at some good local venues. \r\n\r\nDurring the summer of 2011 he proved one more time that he is on the right track by winning the “Next Producer Star Remix” contest hosted by Burn Energy Drink. As a result of his winning, Mehmet got hand picked by Sasha himself to join Burn Studios for Sasha and Richie Hawtin's special workshop at SEA Institude. But Mehmet did not stop there. In the following years he released almost 100 tracks at digital download stores along with many Dj sets where he also provided free tracks to his fans. \r\n\r\nMehmet Akar is undeniably a genuine believer of music, and not of the business in music.\r\n\r\nfacebook.com/mehmetakarmusic\r\nsoundcloud.com/mehmetakar\r\ntwitter.com/mehmetakar",

Messing up his dad's precious records in the family hi-fi was probably his first attempt with a turntable which was probably the first indication of his upcoming future. Music was in the background of his life, where he has addicted himself to basketball and played against current NBA players like Mehmet Okur of Utah Jazz and Hedo Turkoglu of Orlando Magic.\r\n\r\nWhen he was 18, music became more than an interest after he bought his first set of 1210s. Infuenced primarily by Derrick May and his Chicago/Detroit style of discoish house and techno, he played his first gigs among house parties and amateur club parties. In 1998 he was accepted to the legendary Radio 2019, to host his 2 hour show 3 times weekly in the radio's Dance Department slot. His show at Radio 2019 went uninterrupted until March 2000 when the radio was sold and became an alternative rock radio. Until that time, he had proven his name alongside other leading dj's and was getting monthly and weekly residencies at clubs like Godet and Filter, which were considered as the best venues to dance to techno. Also getting gigs in nearly every club in Istanbul and playing in strong events like the 1st and 2nd A.d.A. Istanbul parties were the proof that his fans were not limited by only the technoheads in Turkey.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Gokce was selected to be the first Turkish DJ at the infamous Red Bull Music Academy. Together with 29 other djs/producers, he went to Sao Paulo, Brazil, to meet and learn from electronic music icons like Robert Owens, Charlie May and DJ Marky. Also finding the opportunity to play at the local clubs and events in Sao Paulo, Gokce played his last techno set over there and came back to Turkey with the idea of changing and slowing down his music to a deeper level. Upon his return, he joined Radio FG, the leading electronic music station in Turkey. The change of his music caused the change of his name and he got the \"Procombo\" moniker which basically derived from a Chinese food menu. Playing a blend of music ranging from deep dubby tech house to deep techno, but mainly cruising at the progressive altitudes with a bit of breaks inbetween, Gokce had great support from FG to his new style and played together with some real important names like Hernan Cattaneo, Dave Seaman, Max Graham, John Creamer & Stephane K, James Holden and Rowan Blades in events like the massive Electronica Fest 2004/2005 and Global Gathering 2008/2009 and the Renessaince Masters series in Istanbul. .\r\n\r\nCurrently as Procombo, Gokce hosts his bi weekly radio shows in Radio FG every Wednesday (23:00-24:00) and which could be caught online through the radio's website www.futuregeneration.net.

This then led to him to sign contracts with Sheeva Records, Dark Pleasure Records, Panda Recordings, Solid Fabric Recordings, Mistique Music and Balkan Connection.\r\nKaanturker has a natural ability with his hands,without prior experiance,he manages to fix washing machines, DVD players and even does plumbing. He prefers experimenting in the kitchen with unusual flavours, and creates colourful dishes. He drinks at least 15 cups of coffee a day which causes him to have anxiety attacks and for his hands to shake unstoppably - which he claims is due to the excitement he gets out of his job.",

He started with collecting a wide range of records and attending countless gigs that introduced him to many of the biggest names out there. That, of course, led to being influenced by them. Then came the inevitable decision to try DJing, and with his success at that he decided to increase the dose by finally setting his foot on producing.\r\n\r\nHe practiced his skills by playing at almost every club in his hometown, as well as at other cities in Turkey and a few spots in Europe, with more to follow.\r\n\r\nAlthough techno and house are his favorites, everything can be expected from his sets due to his wide-ranging background in music. As for his artistic signature, you will be hearing a dark, emotional sound, yet with groovy, rhythmic beats.\r\n\r\nNowadays Sarp is busy preparing some new stuff to be released under his TBA alias; so make sure to stay tuned!\r\n\r\nfor all inquiries: sarpozaydin@gmail.com",

It’s an old cliché, but it’s one that’s been the definition of Omaar Dee-Jay's musical career. Just as the dance music world was heading into the world of house, Omaar was there. And then, when it began to embrace the mix of tech and soul, Omaar was there again, leading the way with his impeccable productions. As Omaar goes, it seems, so does electronic music. And, as someone who’s never content to do the same thing twice, it’s clear that he’ll be staying on top for years to come.\r\nNow a international DJ and MC star, Now he has work at the Club Pacha Marmaris and Karia Productions.",

  "artist_bio": "Firstly we need to indicate that among “many others” this natural-born dj/producer Onur Kaymak (better known as K-Billy) didn’t start to play piano at the age of five.. Yeah we are pretty sure you know what we’r talking about..\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, more than 10 years he is one of the most listened radio personality of Turkey, every weekday doing his radio show and still on the top.. And also ..Firstly we need to indicate that among \"many others\" this natural-born talent dj/producer Onur Kaymak (better known as K-Billy) didn't start to play piano at the age of five( Yeah you know what we’r talking about..) Actually his family always want to see him as an engineer and he also became an engineer too..\r\nBut from the first day of college, K-Billy knew that he didn't belong to that life so finally the passion for the music overcomes and he started to work on his college's radio station as a radio dj at the age of 19. In the meantime he started his professional dj career and after long party nights K-Billy was always the one who sleeps at laboratory lessons..\r\nK-Billy always knew that people can't be remarkable without doing extraordinary works so he always follow his path, do the different things and this brings him great success in his professional life. After finally graduated from his school he started to work at the best radio station in Turkey and still working there as one of the most listening djs'..\r\nAmong long years his only ambition was being a good dj, not a producer but then when he was at one of the sensation white festival, he saw the dj and he was only at early ages of 20's and normally that lights a fire in his mind. No doubt he is good at djing, actually we can say him a mix monster, party rocker.. But there is a realty that he must go into production world to reach much more people. And from the first production to the last one he has done, K-Billy shows why we said natural born producer at the top. Well for about the natural born dj part; You must see his energetic, crazy performance whenever he comes to your city..",

  "artist_bio": "Turkey (Turk & American) based, Old Indie-Dubstep, Chiptune music duo. First Dubstep & Chiptune music group in Turkey. Skull & Bones, Skull House; Jasty Minas & Gorkem Deniz as established in July 2011.(!) This biography was written with Turkish.\r\n\r\nTürkiye'de henüz yeni yeni Dubstep / Indie türleri yükselmeye başlamışken; Haziran 2011 tarihinde, Görkem Deniz Şahin (5 Subat 1994) ve Jasty Minas (3 Ocak 1993) birlikte \"Skull & Bones\" grubunu kurmuş, Antalya'da \"Skull House\" plak şirketi adı altında bu türde parçalar yayınlamaya başlamıştır. Türk ve Amerikan olan bu ikili, dönemin popüler parçalarına yaptıkları remikslerle türün dinleyicileri tarafından beğeni kazanmıştır.\r\nGrubun ilk 2 ayı yarım bırakılan, tasarlanıp hayata geçirilemeyen bir çok proje ve taslak sebebiyle sessiz geçmiştir. Ilk remiks olarak, Ağustos 2011'de grup \"Party Rock & ET Remixes\" adını verdikleri promo 2 remiks yayınlamıştır. Ilk orijinal parça olarak, aynı ay içerisinde grup \"Foster's Zombie House\" adında 2 parçalık bir EP yayınlamıştır. Eylül 2011'de grup, Jasty Minas'ın eğitimi dolayısıyla Los Angeles'a dönmesinden itibaren 7 ay yeni bir proje yayınlamamıştır.\r\n\r\n2012 yılbaşında Jasty Minas, Türkiye'ye dönmüş ve Skull & Bones gelecek bir ay için yeni projeler üretmeye başlamıştır. Şubat 2012'de grup Daft Punk'ın \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" adındaki parçasının, 2 farklı versionunu yayınlamıştır. Bonus olarak Kanye West'in Stronger parçasını da bu promo arasına eklenmiştir. Aynı ay içerisinde, Görkem Deniz Şahin'in doğum günü sebebiyle grup özel bir parti düzenlemiştir. Mart 2012'de grup Türkiye'de 7 şehirde etkinliklere katılacaklarını, turne yapacaklarını duyurmuştur. Aynı ay içerisinde grup, \"Dark Energy\" adında bir Single yayınlamıştır ve Burn Studios Mix-Off Sessions 2012 yarışmasına katılmış, yarı finale yükselmiştir. Mayıs 2012'de grubun turnesi sona ermiş ve \"4 Revolution\" adında 4'lük remiks promo yayınlamıştır. Haziran 2012'de grup \"Blondown\" adında bir Single yayınlamıştır. Aynı ay içerisinde grup \"Analog Eurasia\t\" adında haftalık bir radyo yayını yapmayı planlamış fakat bu fikir 5. bölümden sonra iptal edilmiştir.  Temmuz 2012'de grup \"Avrupa Star DJ'ini Arıyor\" yarışmasına katılmış ve yarışma için \"First Year Anniversary Mix\" adında bir set yayınlamıştır. Yarışma daha sonra iptal olmuş, grup aynı ay içerisinde 11 şehirde ve 2 ülkede etkinliklere katılacaklarını, turneye hazırlandıklarını açıklamıştır. Aynı ay içerisinde grup Daft Punk'ın \"Derezzed\" parçasına remiks yapmıştır. Kasım 2012'de turneler sona erdi ve bu tarihde ikili arasında tartışma yaşandı, grup bahaneler sebebiyle çalışmayı durdurduklarını açıkladı.\r\n\r\n2013 yılbaşında Görkem Deniz Şahin, grubun tekrar bir araya geldiğini açıkladı. Ayrıca Ikili tarzlarını da değiştireceklerini, henüz bunun üzerinde çalıştıklarını, herhangi bir sonuca ulaşamadıklarını da belirtti. Deneysel bir çalışma olarak grup, Ocak 2013'de \"The Oracle Lys\" adında bir set yayınladı. Bu deneyimden mutlu olmayan ikili Şubat 2013'de yeni tarzlarının \"Chiptune\" olacağını açıkladı. Grup, Indie / Dubstep dönemine ait tüm kayıtları kaldırdı ve tamamiyle \"Chiptune\" türüne yöneldi. Değişim ile birlikte grubun ilk remiksi Daft Punk'ın \"Around The World\" parçasına oldu. Aynı ay içerisinde grup; James Horner'ın Braveheart filminin ana teması başta olmak üzere; \"A Gift of A Thistle\", \"Wallace Courts Murron\", \"The Secret Wedding\", \"Murron's Burial\", \"Sons of Scotland\", \"For The Love of A Princess\", \"Freedom, The Execution Bannockburn\" parçalarına, Daft Punk'ın \"Da Funk\" ve Deadmau5'un \"Strobe\" parçasına remiks yaptı. Mart 2013'de grup Daft Punk'ın remikslerinin bulunduğu bir \"Remixes, Compilation Album\" yayınlayacaklarını duyurdu; \"The World Is Daft\". Aynı ay içerisinde grup, Daft Punk'ın \"Aerodynamic\" ve \"Digital Love\" parçalarına, Lorne Balfe'nin Assasin's Creed III oyunu için yaptığı \"Assasin's Creed III Main Theme\" parçasına remiks yaptı. Nisan 2013'de grup Ke$ha'nın \"Your Love Is My Drug\" ve Daft Punk'ın \"Harder, Better Faster Stronger\" parçalarına 2 versiyon halinde (Extended, Instrumental) remiks, Jeremy Soule'un The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim adlı oyun için yaptığı \"The Dragonborn Comes\" parçasına mini-mix yapmıştır. Mayıs 2013'de yaz döneminin ortasına kadar yeni bir parça yayınlamayacaklarını belirten grup turne hazırlığına başlamıştır. Haziran 2013'de grup, Taksim Gezi Parkı Protesto'ları üzerine destek amaçlı turne hazırlıklarını durdurmuş ve Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart'ın \"Turkish March\" parçasının bir Chiptune Version'unu #OccupyGezi etiketiyle yayınlamıştır. Şuan grup; \"The World Is Daft\" albümünden sonra \"Tale of The North\" adında bir albüm yayınlayacaklarını duyurmuştur.",

  "artist_bio": "Goktug Citci was born in a beautiful city called Istanbul, in 1979.He came across with electronic music in the beginning of 90s, and started listening to everything he could find.\r\n\r\nThe archive he had been accumulating over the years was neither fitting his house, nor his soul anymore. What gave him a buzz is being able to share his music with others, so with the thought of -Music is best when shared-, he started a radio show at the now defunct: Radio Cool, where he also started tampering with music production. This was the year 1997.\r\n\r\nFast-forward to 2001, and the first product of his newly established home studio was “Cervus – Faraway” on XTC Records. His second release on Sadie Records, “Four Days” was featured in Paul Van Dyk’s “Politics of Dancing” compilation; which also marks the birth of Subsky.\r\n\r\nStarting in 2003, he was releasing his hazy, melancholic, melodic and intelligent dance music infused with groovy eclectic themes back to back on respected labels. “Strawberry Fields”, which appears on Nick Warren’s GU24 Reykjavik, is one of those that makes you go: Sounds like Subsky!\r\n\r\n2004 witnessed the launch of Red Flag Collective, the label that he formed with Yunus Guvenen, Baris Turker and Muzo B. “Let it Flow” was the second release on RFC and it enjoyed the top spot of the Balance Chart.\r\n\r\nHis booty of Miss Kittin’s “Professional Distortion” was a huge hit with Sasha and had a dwell on everyone else’s mind who partied that summer.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his production career, he’s been djing in Turkey and around the globe for the past 10 years. He was crowned the No. 1 dj in Turkey in 2005. With a career that is punctuated by landmark achievements, he tries to reflect his own sound to his dj sets and he is known as a ‘satisfaction guaranteed’ dj by partygoers and promoters in Turkey.\r\n\r\nHe is also part of the Dinamo 103.8 FM crew in Istanbul, working as a Music Director and Production Manager.\r\n\r\nCheck out Subsky’s show, every Wed. 10 pm till 11 pm (gmt+2) on Istanbul’s urban-electronic radio station \"Dinamo 103.8\" – http://www.dinamo.fm \r\n\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "booking@audiolove.deUğur Altıntaş aka Ugur Project was born in 1982, in İstanbul Turkey. He started his music career when he was only 16 years old. Back then he was already a part of the first and only dance music radio station “Radio 2019”.  While working and undergoing a hard training of Production and Radio Shows he met with trance genre which amazed him at the first sight.\r\n\r\nAfter a while Uğur set sailed for another adventure on Turkish nationwide radio and television news channel “NTV”.  Working in production jobs as a technical crew he got enough experience to form a New Radio channel “Radyo Eksen” with his fellow friends.\r\n\r\nBetween 2001 and 2004 he started to produce his own music and worked with the best dance music radios such as “Cool” and “Radio Quasar” while hosting a radio show that consists of techno sets. \r\n\r\nHe worked hard on the stage just as in the studio.  Between 2001 and 2010 he performed in the highly respected clubs such as Filter, JukeBox, Switch, Republic, Cantina, Filter and Spoon. It goes the same with the festivals. While showing his skills at Parkorman, Maslak Venue and Solar Beach, he shared the stage with the big guns like; Kraftwerk, Faithless, Chemical Brothers and Moby. Especially with his performances in İstanbul and Radio&Tv shows he both hosted and attended he got the chance to made the crowds hear his music.\r\n\r\nEven with his busy schedule between 2010 and 2013 he managed to host a radio show called “HardGroove” at Dinamo FM 103.8.\r\nMusically speaking innovation is his motto. With the projects he put through he managed to bring a new meaning to night life. He organized parties at the biggest night clubs back then. Biggest example to that is “Technodays”. It was the first performance ever in Turkey with 9 records players, 3 mixers and 3 DJ’s playing at the same time. When he was only 23 years old he already reached his 500th performance mark. At that night he decided to tribute his DJ’ing career with a production career.\r\n\r\nHis first project was his track “Turn Around” in the Turkey’s first electronic music compilation album “Future Sound Of Istanbul House Workz” released by EMI and Prosound. This track helped Uğur to demonstrate his production skills and also helped foreign Recording Labels to discover the artist. Just after signing a contract with FHD Records, at 5 May 2008 he released “Turbulence EP” with FHD Records a highly respected company based on UK. Only 3 months later “Zeplin Ep” was released. While improving his production skills and spending most of his free time to music, he started working with more and more Recording Labels. And without a surprise he got a lot of good feedbacks along the way.\r\n\r\nAfter the digital releases Uğur was quite excited about having his first record released by the German Record Label “Thokadee”. After the first week of release his “Dope Ep” was already reached number 4 at the list. One of the special things about this Record was its colour. It was white and the B side of the record has the symbol of moon and the star symbolizing Turkish flag.  Coming right after one another his other records share the same success with his first records. His works got remixed by Spencer K, Alex Q, Francesco Bonora, Cess, Alex Costa, Ronan Portela, Oscar Barila, Jay Kurmis, Israel VichSergio Parrado Mario Aureo, IPagan and helped his music to reach the masses. After all the hard work he started to cooperate with internationally famous names. Always keeping connection with Turkey, he started to work with two successful producer named Sarp Yılmaz and Sinan Kaya.  With a collaboration like that their remixes and EP’s reached far beyond Turkey’s borders. \r\nAnother big project was with Angelo Ferreri. With the help of famous Back and Forth Records owned by Cosmic Cowboys they released Sad Moment EP. It was in over 100 DJ charts. In 2013 his “Diren/Gezi” record was published by Ostwind Records. After that record published he became the Turkey’s number 1 for being in almost every DJ chart in Europe.\r\n\r\nSpending his free time mostly in the Studio Uğur was in over 40 Solo, 50 Compilation albums and remixed over 30 artists. Without productivity concerns he is known as hardest working DJ/Producer.\r\n\r\nNowadays he is working on a project to form Audiolove Recordings with his old friend German Producer DJ Ali Özoğlu aka Cess. Within all the fuss he is performing at clubs every month. \r\n\r\nFor more information about his podcasts, sets and upcoming releases you can check the links below.",

With a master's degree in sound engineering, he keeps the creative side of his brain heavily occupied making different genres of music under different names. \r\n\r\nHe spins house and disco under his own name, while under his Beto Narme moniker he delves into the darker side of things producing a unique garage/techno hybrid. A former Red Bull Music Academy participant, he played in influential festivals like Sónar and c/o Pop and keeps his residency at the most envelope-pushing clubs in Istanbul. A version of his track Back To Fine (taken from his Toy Harmonics EP) was chosen by Joris Voorn as the opening track of his set at Creamfields 2010.",
