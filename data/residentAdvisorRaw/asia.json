With fellow dance music enthusiast (which later became tutor and best friend), Ferry Sarmanella a.k.a DJ Debon, Uchiel started collecting dance music mix CDs, with early influences ranging from Digweed, Sasha, Danny Howells, Danny Tenaglia, Steve Lawler etc.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, by late 2002, Uchiel decided to buy his first set of turntables and with the help of DJ Blanco and DJ Debon studied the art of DJing. His earlier influences naturally lead him to choose house/progressive house as his first musical endeavor as a DJ.\r\n\r\nHowever, his passion for dance music encouraged him to explore dance music further and search for fresher underground sounds, and by the end of 2003, he tried to push Trance into the mainstream Indonesian dance scene. Always one to push musical taste to its limits, his determination did not go unnoticed, as he was nominated as Paranoia’s Rookie of the year the following year.\r\n\r\nBy 2005, his unrelenting passion for dance music became his sole reason to study sound engineering at SAE Institute Sydney. This excellent studying opportunity was also an excellent ground to expand his musical horizon. During his studies there he was exposed to the deep and quirky sounds of minimal house/techno, which soon rocked his thirst for underground dance music. And by the time he came back o Jakarta in 2007, Uchiel was already pushing a new sound, however bizarre it was to the local ears.\r\n\r\nAndree Uchiel is a DJ that puts musicality and taste to the forefront of his sets. His sets are not your routine by the hour DJ set. Exploration and journey are his trademark originality, new and fresh sounds are always his first choice. Earning him the place as \"REDMA Techno DJ of the year\" nominee, for two years in a row\r\ne has had the honor to share decks with quite of a handful of DJs from diverse genres of dance music. Christoper Lawrence, Stacey Pullen, Terrence Chong, DJ Gabriel, Naro, Romy, Anton, Ai, Remy Irwan, 1man and many more. This shows that he is a DJ with a deep passion and respect to all kinds of Electronic Dance Music. As his hero Sasha said : “I can go to all style of music”, to Andree Uchiel there’s only two kinds of dance music – quality or junk.\r\n\r\nNowadays, Andree Uchiel is pushing the techy underground sounds, paired with classy house grooves. He is also one third of electrosoul’s live act, known as Soulmanellas, which was only recently nominated as Ravelex Dance Music Award’s Best Duo/Live Act.\r\n\r\nWith all these talents and upcoming musical productions; He is clearly a DJ you must check-out and tune in to!!!",

  "artist_bio": "Driven by his love for the electronic dance music since an early age, Joe has learned from the best in the industry having played alongside the icons such as Remy, David Carretta, Norman Jay, Oxia, Omid 16B and many more that spans back 20 years. Since, he has performed in the top venues across Europe and Asia, showing a rare ability to feel and steer the energy of the audience, be it an intimate private party, a fashion show, club or an international music festival. His sets are renowned for their technical creativity and tight mixing, while encompassing a tastefully blended range of styles, as he believes that a mix of different genres is the key to raising and keeping up the energy of the dance floor. He combines Deep House, Tech-house, and Funky Techno with a dash of Nu Disco aspects,Joe’s introduction to the world of Electronic dance music started in his mid-teens when he was in living in Jakarta, Indonesia, at the local clubs playing a lot of the early Dutch Club sound. He was so fascinated with the energy of the music that he bought his own turntables and started mixing. Shortly afterwards he became a part of the local music scene and even started to organize his own parties in various venues with some of the leading local DJʼs. \r\n\r\nAfter four years in Indonesia he moved to Holland in 1997 to start his sound engineering studies. Upon arrival, he quickly immersed himself in the local music scene and came in contact with some of the country’s living legends. During his 4 years in Holland, Joe played regularly with DJ Ramon and Gilbert at their residential club LADS in Den Haag, organized parties at renowned Catacombs club in Amsterdam, where he played together with Bart Skillz and Shinedoe, and had a monthly residency at the Club Vaghuizen – at the time, one of the most highly sought-after underground venues in Holland.\r\n\r\nEven once Joe moved to Paris in 2001 and started his career working for one of the top professional speakers’ manufacturers, music remained his passion that he always managed to find the time for. While in France, he participated in three different night organizations and played regularly at electronic music events across Paris, as well as becoming a resident of the annual Electro Choc festival taking place in Marseille. Moreover, Joe took trips to Indonesia where he was invited to play at the major clubs and events of Jakarta and Bali, as well as Mexico, where he DJ’ed at a host of parties across the country with his Parisian-based DJ partner Rob K. \r\n\r\nIn 2010 Joe  decided to move back to Indonesia and to pursue his life-time passion of DJ’ing. He quickly became one of the leading DJs in Bali with residencies at Bali’s most prestigious venues and, for two consequtive years, 2011-2012, Joe was nominated as Best DJ in The YAK Awards hosted by Bali’s premier luxury lifestyle magazine.\r\n\r\nJoe is currently in the works of developing ideas for his own productions and plans to soon have his production work and DJ sets broadcasted on the ever-growing specialized DJ radio ʻRadio LFO”.\r\n",

Revolutionizing the face of the common male/female DJ icons we had become accustomed to, by creating a new phenomenon; the “Electric Barbarellas” (The first female duo in Indonesia). This provocative partnership impressed all music lovers with their uncanny ability to dish up ready-made dance floor fusion, creating a unique party atmosphere that so many other labels lacked. Dance music just got kinky. After winning prestigious awards such as The Best Rookie DJ in 2006 for Paranoia Award, The Best Female DJ and The Best Junior DJ in 2007 for Redma Award, 1st Runner Up for The Best Female DJ Redma 2008, it was time for a new look. Having confidence in the style of her music, but acknowledging the need for continuous change, rather than finding one style and sticking to it, DD likes to keep her sets as varied as possible, playing right across the board, from electro to dirty house and everything in between with her sassy and sexy style. This “sultry sage” has developed an immense and devoted fan base. Now, after being at the top of her game behind the decks, Delizious Devina is proving she is much more than just a DJ. Born from Dutch and Indonesian parents and raised in Sydney, this beauty was fascinated by art and music and graduated with a degree in Graphic Design and Multimedia. She started her career in the hospitality industry and took up a hobby in collecting vinyls and painting. Her affection for art and music is what pushed her to become a DJ. In addition to Devina’s passion for music she is a regular guest star for television shows, also she has been featured on most popular magazines. Endorsed by Magma and Slappa, Delizious Devina is set to be a promising force and undeniable talent in the contemporary music scene.",

Apparently on late 2013, Android 18 began to start his solo project, while INTERSTELLAR was on hiatus.\r\n\r\nAfter playing his part in several other moments considered integral to dance music scene, like playing on several reputable clubs on Bandung & Jakarta collaborating with Papermoon Records, Aboutwax, Bhang Records and other reputable indie music community.

Since then....Being interested in producing electronic music since the year 2000, Dunie finally discovered that he has created an electronic music world within himself. Since then, hanging out with musician friends from Jogja, Dunie has kept on learning and doing explorations on the elements of sound found on some of his music’s software. Till now, Dunie has been using sounds and melodies which are very unique and rarely heard. The year 2005 in Jogja, the city where he grew up, Dunie began to fall in love to the Drum’N’Bass music scene.\r\n\r\nEarly 2007, Dunie started pouring out his ideas by performing with a duo-group KREZIKULTUR, which plays basically Drum’N’Bass. At the beginning of their carrier, this group has already performed at some internationally known electronic art events in Indonesia, like Soundboutique-Electrocity, CELLSBUTTON, and Yogyakarta International Videowork Festival. Krezikultur have also pushed through the Jakarta electronic music industry in the compilation album “HOMEGROWN a compilation of Indonesian Drum’N’Bass”, which is now in the promoting stage.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Dunie also regularly collaborates with other electronic art musicians and a few multimedia visual artists. In Bali, Dunie has collaborated with the band Day After The Rain at Bali JAMFEST 2008.\r\n\r\nHis means are to introduce new media art, especially electronic music, mainly Drum’N’Bass, more deeply to people, to create a broader DnB community in Indonesia and other countries around the world.\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "A seemingly controversial figure, Sanjion has injected his own brand of deep, dark Dubstep and UK Bass into the underground of Jakarta nightlife through his label, 24/7 Dubstep. The crowd in Jakarta have not warmed to this sound as yet, and it still seems an uphill struggle, but you cannot ignore the reputation that PROPER and 24/7 are building for no-nonsense, straight up riddims, and heavyweight basslines.Having previously made a name for himself as Drift, the Drum n' Bass MC, 2009 saw the birth of Jakarta's first pure Dubstep night with Sanjion at the helm. Creating a brand, image and concept that promised to be different from anything else on the Jakarta nightlife radar, Sanjion recruited buddies Mils, Alife and General G to represent their own shades of UK Bass and together as a DJ collective, deliver this sound undiluted through a monthly event called \"PROPER\".\r\n\r\nSince it's inception, PROPER has inspired other local promoters and DJs to start their own dubstep nights, and to mix dubstep into their usually more commercial sets. Sanjion was responsible for bringing Headhunter, Ramadanman and Cooly G to Indonesian shores between 2010 - 2011. The significance of this may have been lost on the Indonesian public though, as Skrillex taking the Grammies has probably inspired their choice of music and knowledge of the genre far more. \r\n\r\nThat said, Sanjion and the 24/7 crew continue to push the pure London variant of bassline music in Jakarta, and are still championing their cause. Find evidence of this on their podcast, if you're not in the vicinity. If you are, then check PROPER every month at Tree House, Kemang. Always listed on Resident Advisor.\r\n\r\n",

What might be construed as negative for some people are attributes that have paved the way to a start of a fast and colorful DJ career for him.\r\n\r\nHe started dj-ing circa 2007, which by standards is considered to be relatively recent yet has achieved quite a lot due to the hard work and dedication put into almost everything that he does. Late 2009 was like a catapult for LFS. Ministry of Sound @ Euphoria, the prestigious stamp in the electronic music world signed him on as one of their resident DJs. They didn’t miss! Every action has a reaction, in his case it allowed him to open up , play/support numerous world renowned djs such as Tydi, Kaskade, Steve Aoki, Andy Moor, Jaytech, Andy Duguid, Darren Tate, Mr.Sam, Agnelli & Nelson, LMFAO, Dash Berlin and many more local DJs.\r\n\r\nIn the past 3 years , LFS has kept a frantic pace, in terms of dishing out numerous bootlegs, mashes and podcasts. One of the things that distinguish LFS's style is that it's hard to define. Helming the Trancenation/EDM Fridays and Mixtape back2back Saturdays at MOS portays this headstrong DJ is versatile. Tailoring his approach on house/trance and openformat choons with a meticulous ear and a bottomless record collection proves no dj should be confined to just one genre.\r\n\r\nHis development until 2010 reflects a traditional yet highly rewarding approach to becoming and evolving as a DJ. At the same time, his career represents a very personal evolution of what one can achieve if you cast the foundation right.\r\n\r\nHas played alongside: \r\nAndy Duguid\r\nDarren Tate\r\nMr.Sam\r\nAgnello&Nelson\r\nDeadmau5\r\nTv Rock\r\nDash Berlin\r\nLMFAO\r\nStretch Armstrong\r\nFirst State\r\nClaudia Cazacu\r\nDJ Vice\r\nLil Jon\r\nGina Star\r\nRank1\r\nJochem Miller\r\nLange\r\nSuper8 & Tab\r\nMyon&Shane54",

As he described the style is of the infusion of sexy funk vibes, sleek minimal sounds,electro and rich, thumping techno digitalism, minimal, electro and sexy house vibes.\r\n\r\n As Nyl’s popularity continues to quickly gained it’s momentum, his passion and hard work is paid-off when he recently won the Best House Music DJ & Best Resident DJ for the 2012 Choons Award Malaysia with his original track titled “Deeptyc” being selected and won a place as one of the Top 12 Producers this year.\r\n\r\nAdding on to the past achievements, he could not be more proud when his very first original track - “Kalu” was selected earlier in 2011 and was also among the Top 12 Producers for Choons Awards 2011.\r\n\r\nThese achievements helped elevate his level of confidence, further encouraging him to produce more tracks and with the full support from family and friends, Nyl signed up with a local recording label.

I don’t know whether this is possible or not but my dream is to bring back the house music genre into KL dance music scene like how it used to be back in the late 90’s...”",

His wide taste towards dance music makes him one of the very few DJs who can adapt his musical style to suit the mood that he intends to create for different venues. Being very much a part of the dance scene since his teen years has definitely helped much in cultivating his knowledge and preference for playing his own fusion and eclectic sound that can be described as deep, progressively melodic and techy to permanently engraving his name into the industry and becoming a familiar face behind the decks of some of the finest clubs around the country such as Zouk, Velvet Underground, Maison, Nouvo, Sugar, Espanda, Pure Bar, Marketplace and outdoor events like Transit 50 hours non-stop New Year Pa..Discovering turntables and the sounds it could churn out with a mixer connected to the speakers was the best thing that had happened to him. Passion and imagination for electronic music has since become an addiction.\r\n\r\nDezz speaks of tasteful musical sense that is much supported by many experienced DJs around town. His wide taste towards dance music makes him one of the very few DJs who can adapt his musical style to suit the mood that he intends to create for different venues. Being very much a part of the dance scene since his teen years has definitely helped much in cultivating his knowledge and preference for playing his own fusion and eclectic sound that can be described as deep, progressively melodic and techy to permanently engraving his name into the industry and becoming a familiar face behind the decks of some of the finest clubs around the country such as Zouk, Velvet Underground, Maison, Nouvo, Sugar, Espanda, Pure Bar, Marketplace and outdoor events like Transit 50 hours non-stop New Year Party. After receiving overwhelming response since its inception, he started his own night “Midnight Funk Association” and “Sublime” which sees him supplying his own blend of exceptional experience in music to offer a genuine alternative. As he continues to blur the line in between genres, he travels abroad playing at the legendary Full Moon Party at Koh Phangan and Koh Samui in Thailand, Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi in Vietnam and Melbourne in Australia.\r\n\r\nHe bagged the 2nd runner up in the Heineken Juice Magazine DJ Quest 2006 and also secured a place in the much technically anticipated Pioneer Digital DJ Battle Final in December 2006. His technical ability behind the decks have seen him support artist such as Stacey Pullen (US), Eric Entrena (SPA), Simon Coyle (Aus), Veiga (Aus), Juri Menucci (Italy) to name a few.\r\n\r\nAs he continue to push forward, he host his own bi-monthly internet radio show “EVOLUTION” on Bangkok’s Underground Bangkok Radio Station (www.ubradio.net) and monthly radio show “ReKonstrukt” on much acclaimed Digitally Imported Radio from New York (www.di.fm), where there are millions of audience from every corner of the world listen to these radio channel.\r\n\r\nAfter releases on Tech Art Records and Asia Music under his belt, he is looking forward for more progress and pushing the boundaries rather than settling with the old. As promising as he can be, one would certainly not want to miss him in actions… Definitely!\r\n\r\n“Dark, filthy and befitting any big room you’d trek miles out of town to on the unholy side of 3am, nevertheless, if there’s one thing that stands out about Dezz, it’s his crazy level of confidence – he looks like he was born behind the decks. His powerful pounding house, trippy minimal, and mind-bending progressive and techno selections as “raw, dirty and fresh”, which goes to show where determination can get you.” (Juice Magazine)",

Although, he has garnered an abundance of support from the scene as a DJ, his passion production couldn’t be overlooked.\r\n\r\nFlikswitch is indeed more than just a DJ. A man with few words, his personality is reflected in the music he makes. His first release, ‘Bumped’ was picked up by the legendary Nicky C and his label 220V in back in 2009. Flikswitch’s debut received the local scene’s stamp of approval as an aspiring music producer when he bagged the Producer of the Year award at the highly recognised CHOONS Awards in the following year. \r\n\r\nIn a scene that’s increasingly inhabited by hype and trends, Flikswitch stays true to his style that’s determined by drive, minus the drama, which incidentally is why he is not only respected by fans but his peers as well. Winning the title of Producer of the Year led him to churning out a slew of productions, bootlegs and remixes. His deep understanding of the multiple schools of music philosophy is evident in the tunes he creates. ‘Dengan Mu’ showcases a more Afro-Latin and R&B approach while his and Victor G’s bootleg of Yuna’s ‘Live Your Life’ features a more progressive and modern outlook. Drawing influences from R&B and soul of black American music, Flikswitch tries to reflect those vibes in his music while staying true to his creative tastes.\r\n\r\nIt’s the love for music that has gotten Flikswitch this far in his music career. Catering to a new generation of music lovers whose taste differs from the audience he has been used to challenges him to innovate. You can bet he has more than just a bag of tricks up his sleeve. \r\n\r\nFlikswitch’s love for music was embedded into his DNA from the very beginning. From learning to play the piano at the age of four, he moved on to arranging instrument parts for his school band music. A true blue fan of everything good in the music scene, kick starting a DJ career in 2005 was inevitable as his interest and passion for electronic dance music began to soar in the early 2000’s.\r\n\r\nIt was electro house that got him going as a DJ before graduating to the deep side of the force.

A resident DJ in KL clubs for 15 years, he has warmed up audiences for practically every A-List DJ you can name, a roll call that reads like a history lesson in electronic dance music that includes David Morales, Fatboy Slim, Pete Tong, Chicane, Sasha, Hernan Cattaneo, Carl Cox, Nic Fanciulli and Paul van Dyk, with many visiting stars requesting that Terence opens for them.\r\n\r\nTo his loyal fans, Terence C is known as the Malaysian John Digweed – a longtime hero to Terence – both for his technical ability, his depth of knowledge of dance music that spans both time and genres and in his ability to program thrilling sets to suit every occasion at the drop of a hat. From deep house, tech house and techno, nothing fazes this industry professional.\r\n\r\nA sign of his maturity and skill, he is the go-to guy whenever Digweed plays KL, having notched up at least 5 opening or closing sets for him at the Bedrock icon’s request.\r\n\r\nFor the past 9 years, he’s been a vital part of Zouk KL, Malaysia’s landmark international clubbing destination. From leading some of the city’s leading regular nights to doubling up as a VJ, Terence C has been an important and integral part of defining the musical identity that Zouk enjoys today.\r\n\r\nConstantly called back to his true love, techno, Terence is also helming another monthly night at Zouk called ‘We Love Techno’ in association with one of KL’s leading leftfield players DJ XU, concentrating on the underground sounds coming out of labels like Drumcode, Cocoon Recordings, Bedrock Records, Poker Flat Recordings, Maktub Music, Octopus Records, Trapez, Mobilee Records, Ovum Recordings, Connaisseur Recordings, Visionquest, Lost & Found, Crosstown Rebels, Get Physical Music, Bpitch Control, Supplement Facts, Soma Records, Kompakt was born and raised in Zouk.\r\n\r\nKicking off his career as a DJ in 1998 as a protégé of DJ Chris Doss, he grew in the industry with several residences in KL at Cubeat and Globar under his belt. An early and major break for this talented player came in the shape of warming up for New York legend David Morales at the peak of his powers for his first ever Malaysian show.\r\n\r\nAt the forefront of one of the most exciting periods in Malaysia’s dance music history, Terence was a resident at the seminal Movement club at the turn of the millennium. Since then, he’s appeared wherever dance music has flourished in this city: Backroom, Nouvo and Atmosphere. Reaching across South East Asia, Terence has also performed at Lush in Singapore and Liquid Club in Ho Chi Minh City.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Terence helped to spearhead a new audio-visual collective called Altered Image with fellow artists Callen Tham and Didjital. At the cutting edge of a wave of international artists who were going far beyond the usual DJ-VJ format, Altered Image mixed cinematic visuals, turntable beats and live FX and samples in a mixture that never forgot that the dancefloor was its true home.\r\n\r\nWinning the Malaysian heats of the internationally renowned Heineken Thirst competition that year, the trio went on to perform across South East Asia as Altered Image, picking up a new fanbase as they toured.\r\n\r\nSince then, Terence has always remained at the forefront of technical innovation and has invested considerable time and energy in mastering the Ableton Live production suite and now plays fully live sets using the software as well as traditional decks and CDJ sets that frequently top 7 hours.\r\n\r\nWith almost ten years at Zouk to his name, Terence C is now emerging from the shadows to concentrate on his production work – with a raft of releases scheduled for later in the year – and increasing his visibility across South East Asia. And with a reputation as Malaysia’s hardest-working DJ he looks poised to achieve it.",

  "artist_bio": "Victor G, undoubtedly one of KL’s most influential house and techno DJ, and overall tastemaker has been keeping himself abuzz with weekly residencies at Elysium Kuala Lumpur and Blue Elephant aside from other one off gigs that he plays. With the ability to groove it down and pump it up at the same time, Victor remains to be a favourite booking for many promoters after 15 years.\r\n\r\nHis method is simple, which is consistently keeping true to his savvy style. Victor continues to be an integral part of the industry as he with many others work to keep the house and techno music alive and kicking despite the lack of commercial appeal for both genres in the country. A true fan of music as a whole, he keeps his passion growing with the music he listens to for work and play.Techno whiz, house head and influential tastemaker are well-deserved titles Victor G has rightfully earned in his electronic dance music career. With a thriving run spanning over 15 years in the local scene, KL’s favourite deck maestro has definitely paid his dues.\r\n\r\nFrom early beginnings of turning the wheels of steel at Bangsar’s favourite haunt, The White Room in 1999 to spinning his way to the trendiest spots today including Nagaba KL and the Blue Elephant, Victor G proves time and time again why he is still one of the most sought after DJ’s in the city. The secret to his longevity is simple; keeping true to his preferred style at a consistent pace.\r\n\r\nVictor G’s career build up earned him several accolades along the way. In 2003, he participated and won the top spot at Heineken Juice Magazine DJ Quest competition. He then bagged another trophy by winning the 2004 Vestax Extravaganza DJ competition mixing category and the Pioneer Digital DJ Battle 2004 and 2005 championship and the Pioneer Digital DJ Battle Asian championship 2006.\r\nAfter years of slaving over the decks all over the city, Victor G hit his career peak with a residency at Euphoria by Ministry of Sound in Sunway. While the club’s role in our scene was short lived, he moved on to bigger and better gigs scoring bookings from across the shore including Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore and Australia.\r\n\r\nVictor G’s career continued to soar with a landed residency in Rootz. Playing the role as event promoter and DJ at the same time under OMP Entertainment, they revolutionised the house music scene with their weekly themed night. His reputation led him to become Twenty One Kitchen + Bar’s favourite spinmaster. A venue that required him to fulfil the needs of the masses while keeping true to his roots of house and techno, Victor G’s apt ability to create versatility provided that perfect balance.\r\n\r\nWith a stellar reputation under his belt, the dynamic DJ has been a favourite when it comes to providing tasty appetisers to international heroes like Claude von Stroke, Hot Since 82 and Joris Voorn to name a few. Victor G has also shared the decks with legendary acts including Underworld’s F1 Fuel Concert in Singapore F1 and Basement Jaxx’s debut here in Kuala Lumpur. His festival friendly vibes has also landed him spots at Bali’s Soundrise Festival, Future Music Festival Asia and It’s The Ship.\r\n\r\nA true blue soldier in the dance music spectrum, Victor G marches on to keep the scene alive despite the lack of commercial appeal for the house and techno scene. With a strong sense of belief for the music he loves, his motivation stems from the very idea that there still is a scene to be a part of. Grateful and humbled with a strong following for his individual style, Victor G keeps the torch alive for the sake of his passion.\r\n\r\nWhile entertaining is an obvious goal, educating the audience is an element that he cannot dismiss. Victor G continues to school his audience at various spots around town spewing out tantalising techno at underground events, dishing out hot house tunes at the trendiest night spots and experimenting with his version of chilled out vibes that blend soul and funk while keeping his signature groove intact.",

Determined to hone his craft, he eventually discovered his own brand of dance infusion, playing, at times, on three decks. \r\n\r\nJason Voon sound comes close to being musical anarchy, with explosions of thrilling hard and funky beats running riot from his selection of techno. His love for unique crackers from the underground is evident from selection of floor bombers. \r\nHe first got his taste on vinyls and gears when he was barely 17. His DJ-ing experience later included turntablism and playing tasty house sets in clubs during the late 90’s, and has an instinctive ear for selecting rarer tracks that bursts with hostile energy and his rapid intuition in pulling off tricks never fail to create astonishing results. \r\n\r\nHis dream is not to compete for the best DJ title. Rather, he prefers to be a music ambassador, delivering his concoction of twisted techno and hard dance, just hoping people will go crazy for it. Motivation? Driving beats. And his mission is simply to have vicious fun.\r\nSo hop on the ferris wheel, raise your fists and be prepared to join Jason for a spin on a juicy ride into the sound of tomorrow",

From the bedroom to the mainroom, a full-blown love affair with the decks quickly evolved.\r\nStarting out without any equipment whatsoever or much means to buy records didn’t stop him either -Kubika is living proof that that the Malaysian music scene is alive and kicking and where there’s a will there’s a way.  \r\nA Kelana Jaya boy at heart, this KL lad is determined to take his place in the music world.  \r\n\r\nMainly a Techhouse, techno & minimal enthusiast, Eddy is originally a graphic designer and bass player when he gets the chance. Having been compared to John Digweed at the Malaysian Juice DJ Quest 2009 where he won the Championship title recently, he smiles when his fans tell him that they’re proud of him. This Ritchie Hawthin, Pearl Jam, A-ha, Royksopp and Tiga fan names everything from Men At Work to James Zabiela and ACDC as his main influences. \r\nHis current genre is best described as pumped up tech house with a wicked twist. \r\n\r\nEddy Faizal Zainal or Eddy Kubika as he’s fondly known as has been supplying juicy beats for more than 8 years. Spinning at mostly house parties and private functions for the first 3 years, he got his first big gig launching a club called Metro Lounge in 2005, which is now what is called Marketplace. \r\nRegular gigs in Cloth & Clef, Heritage Mansion, Telawi Street Bistro, M Circle @ Starhill, Blonde, Laundry, Sugar & Backroom II followed which helped him build a name in the scene.\r\nEddy then went on to join Excessive Records in 2008 under the guidance of Malaysian dance music pioneer Bryan Burger who gave him the confidence to begin DJ-ing competitively. An enthusiasm he shares with many fellow up and coming DJs to put their skills to the test, live at National and International levels. \r\nPlaying at Koh Phangan’s Warm Up Bar in June 2008 & then headlining at the party island’s infamous Mountain Bar for NYE 2009 was also a fond highlight. \r\n\r\nWith an exceptionally groundbreaking collection of tunes, a huge heart and plenty of loyal fans, Eddy Kubika is excited to see where his obsession with music will take him and aspires to bring his label Electric Dreams to life. \r\nKubika believes in making a contribution to the Malaysian dance music scene and worldwide. \r\nAfterall, music speaks beyond language, breaks boundaries and has the ability to provide the very foundation to the answers to all the world’s problems.\r\n\r\nHis words to live by: What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.

Before each set he always powers down the previous track and leads the packed dance floor in a show of appreciation for the out-going DJ, before kick-starting his performance into a blaze of visuals, an orchestra of special effects which extracts every quality beat of each track as he begins his show.\r\nTo watch Tekssive is part of the experience. Cocky? Perhaps, but certainly not arrogant, Tekssive is now in control of the minds and bodies of his audience. A very precise and confident body language gives a visual indication to what he is playing as he acts out each track.\r\nYet, he is not dancing; this is something far more emotional. Imagine watching a porn star having hot, rough, yet passionate but dominating sex to a breathless, wailing lover which, in this case, comes in the shape of a mixing desk. Forceful, dominant, aggressive yet somehow tender and caring. The visual impact allows your body to further immerse itself in the ecstasy he is submitting you to your ears alone cannot possibly absorb everything that he is throwing at you.\r\nAs for his sound, imagine every track as a partially completed canvas. Through the use of effects on the mixing desk, Tekssive adds his own colour, texture and feel as he maximises every beat of every track to create the unique insane sound. His precision mixing at incalculable speeds is part of the show; as each track mixes in you can positively feel the dance-floor going up a notch to keep up with the frantic and energetic DJ\r\n\r\nMore…\r\n\r\n Tekssive blend of vocal uplifting bouncy house is like him: deliciously hard yet very accessible. And when Tekssive makes eye contact with you, even if only be for a second, you get to experience the ultimate unique sensation of him seeking your seal of approval. In that moment you have transcended being a mere audience member, into being part of what will almost certainly be the set of the night. The sheer euphoria you feel is exceptional. And then at the end, breathless, skin tingling and with a grin on your face from ear to ear, you feel as though every drop of energy has been sucked right out of you, just like those few moments after one of the best orgasms of your life..\r\nAccompanying Tekssive to a gig is quite an experience. He is literally mobbed upon his arrival and departure from each gig, with fans eager to speak to their idol, or have their photograph taken with him. Mobile phone-cum-digital cameras are designed for such occasions as his devotees put one arm around him and pose with their hero as the other arm acts as a remote-controlled tri-pod for the self-portrait.\r\nTekssive is the standard that so many more strive for. There are a plethora of mixtape compilations that he has mixed and every single track he has produce but listening to one of these is like trying to view a fine piece of art in a darkened room. You need to see him live to really appreciate the full and overwhelming experience that is The Saviour of EDM Dance\r\nThus,Tekssive Was an independent guy.He can learn everything without master.Start from Djing,Tekssive persistently learn through observation,practices and applies the method of trial-and-error into advancing and shining his skills.\r\nSame as his production,He was Inspired by his mentor DJ Fuzz & Nuold Asv Remix. The most give him big spirit is such as “Showtek,Nicky Romero,Hardwell” and so on. All this,which made him drive his passion and career together till today.\r\nYet, Tekssive recently produce his first own original track,and this track attract a lot people all around the world,include DJ ,Producer & Fans love on his track.Such as,DJ Yewplay From Australia,DJ Toco From Brazil,DJ Black From South Korea,DJ Terry Clive From Frence,DJ Missy BG From Hong Kong ,DJ Cal strange From UK ,DJ Cavellry From Australia,DJ In II Deep From Netherlands,DJ Olly Barkins From UK,DJ Azure Life From German,DJ Andoz From Sweden,DJ Tera From South Korea,DJ NON-E From Italy,DJ Ronny Hammond From U.S,DJ Padi From Spain,DJ Kenn From Bangkok,DJ Andreas Mihakalakos From Australia,DJ Detone From Russia,DJ Sauditu From Romania, DJ Wand England From Canada (Radio Host at Safari Radio FM 104.7 (Greece), CEUC Radio (Canada) & Amplitude Radio France) and Recently DJ Wand England was play Tekssive track on his Radio Show!\r\n-At the same time,Tekssive also got play alongside With Mark Sixma / M6 (Armada Music) (biggest Stars under the direct guidance of Armin Van Buuren),Sean & Bobo (DJ & Producer) From Sweden,DJ Zino From Hollen,Emcee Vibe and Emcee Deep!!!\r\nYou can generally tell if a EDM event is going to be credible and worth the money if you see Tekssive name heading the DJ line-up. It’s almost like seeing a quality assurance seal, royal crest or five star rating”.",

Unlike many of his generation, Mustaqim Arifin aka VMPRMYTH holds a distinct devil may care attitude towards his productions. Not often does one find a release, let alone a full LP, that transgresses so many boundaries whilst keeping in line with a thematic whole. \r\n\r\nThe Kuala Lumpur based producer has built a loyal following with strong support for his craft and contribution towards the Malaysian Underground Scene; producing for former group, MUSCLE//MACHINE, rappers Amir Meludah, Jin Hackman, Carbon Kid (NZ), RAC (US) and collaborating with upcoming German producer Kain. \r\n\r\nHEROINe is an album that lives up to its tightly knitted story that urges repeated listening. It’s an entire sonic journey that is dramatic as it is uplifting, pulling the listener in with all possible intensity and let’s go when it needs to. In a surprisingly disciplined fashion, HEROINe leads the listener into an auditory pandemonium within the context of a blissfully dark palette of sound.",

This little boy is also known as Nanameh.\r\n\r\nNazamir Nazir is just a little boy who loves to DJ - what more to make people dance and have a wonderful time. This little boy is also known as Nanameh.\r\n\r\nHe was born on January 30, 1990 in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. Since young, he has had the passion in music and thanks to his parents, he was enrolled at the Yamaha Music School and took up electone when he was 8. During his childhood years, he has learnt how to play other instruments such as Guitar, Piano and Drums therefore, he is quite knowledgeable in music. He also took music production up in college.\r\n\r\nNanameh was introduced to Electronic Dance Music when he attended a friend's party at the age of 15 and was wondering what kind of songs were these boys jumping, dancing, shuffling around till he discovered Tiesto. Since then, he has been breathing on 4:4 beats.\r\n\r\nWhen Nanameh was old enough to hit the clubs, he was just like any other party goer but he then realised that he actually wanted to be the party starter. Seeing Victor G spinning at Euphoria made him even more interested in DJing. A few people had help him give more information about DJing such as which website to look up for. Flikswitch was the first person who gave Nanameh a few tracks to start with. \r\n\r\nBefore Nanameh got his own set of decks, he learnt more about DJing through videos such as Youtube and Dancetrippin.tv. His musical knowledge about Dance Music got even wider. He now listens to the sounds of, such as Richie Hawtin, Loco Dice, Dubfire, Umek and Afrojack.\r\n\r\nNanameh started DJing literally back in February 2010 when his best friend, Aliff Ashari gave his old Technics to him. He later traded it with a pair of CDJ's and got his own. He learnt the art of DJing by himself and after awhile of getting use to his gear, he took part in the Astro Spinmaster at Zouk KL and unfortunately, he only got as far as the Semi Finals. That was Nanameh's first time spinning in a club and in the public.\r\n\r\nHis first gig was at a SoundHertz Event; after getting to know the pioneers of the event, also contestants of SpinMaster, Dj Bad and Dj Hightech.\r\n\r\nNanameh is still new in this scene and is said to have promising hopes by the Judges of SpinMaster; Dj Blink, Dj Goldfish and straight for Australia, Jamie \"The Cut\" Kaye. \r\n\r\nNanameh is looking forward to produce his first own production so that he can bring his name up to the international level.\r\n\r\nRecently he had played alongside one of the best DJ;s in KL such as Shahril Adnan from OMP, Dj Hafidz OMP and Dj Hightech and Bad from Soundhertz, Hebbo from Minimalaysia and also a special guest from Melbourne, Australia. Anas from KL Beats and etc.",

Music has been part of his life since he was a kid. He was well-trained in catching beats, vocal singing and dancing as young as 4. His very first exposure to the limelight was a singing cum dancing performance to his beloved mom on Mother’s Day. \r\n\r\nBeing a very creative person, Tommy, a 19 year old talented newcomer creates the flow of beats and makes it come alive on the dance floor, touches the soul and heart of the crowd. LIFE ain’t anything without a great MUSIC. Growing up in such a melodic & musical environment, Tommy let go of his guitar lessons and took a step further in being part of Royale DJ Academy / Excessive Records under the guidance of Bryan Burger. \r\n\r\nTommy truly believes that… \"Today, music heralds... the establishment of a society of repetition in which nothing will happen anymore.\" – written by Jacques Attali\r\n\r\nTommy is inspired by Carl Cox, one of the world’s most remarkable DJ for his award- winning remixes & shows, appearances in majority of the DJ / music magazines and his music sets are played in various radio stations all over the world. His other influences include: Richie Hawtin, Sasha, Terry Lee Brown Jr, Sven Vath, Johnny D, Underworld, Loco Dice , Format B, and More.\r\n\r\nHaving experienced warming up for DJ Terence C & Bryan Burger at The Loft, Zouk and been invited to play at the first private university in Malaysia – Lim Kok Wing University. At the same time, Tommy has also been invited for the Face2Face Facebook Party at SOHO KL hosted by RAW Club. Having a great time warming up for local and international Djs- Blastique, Glynn Tandy (UK), Joey G (Turn it up), C Master and Kughen. Tommy is proving to be a big hit on the dance floor in clubs around Malaysia.\r\n\r\nExperience his vibration of the sound of music, his perfection on choosing the best tracks to suit your day, his mindful thoughts of wanting you to feel the beats and enjoy yourself to the max with his rocking selections ranging from Deep House, Tech House, Minimal Tech to Techno.\r\n\r\nIn the future, Tommy aims to rock dance floors around the world and conquer all corners of the globe previously left untouched. Besides that, Tommy’s biggest dream is to play the UK's biggest clubs including Slam, Cream, Lakota and Ministry of Sound.",

Calling the world his playground, Kristian is the product of a distinct combination of ethnicity's and exotic locales. His Asian and European heritage, Aussie upbringing and lifelong experience of travelling and performing his music has created a unique individual whose resume and musical influences transcend longitudes, latitudes and attitudes. Design, musical production,performance, DJing and turntablism—these are just a few of the skills and areas of expertise that Kristian has accumulated along with his vast vinyl collection.Kristian first gained notice as a gifted turntablist when he won the Australian Qld. DMC Championships in 1999 and 2000 . Soon he was setting dancefloors and airwaves alight as the host of Australia's longest running Hip-Hop, Soul, Funk and R & B Radio show, Blackbeat on 4ZZZ fm . With flavours of latin rhythms, broken jazz subdivisions, funk meters, together with soul melodies, Dub swing, Reggae groove &  Hip Hop culture are partnered with more electronic sounds such as the beats of House, Breaks, Drum n Bass & Garrage.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that Kristian Hernandez has become a much sought-after musical performer, opening for acts as varied as Jimmy Cliff, DJ Krush, Afrika Bambaata, Ali Shaheed Muhammad A Tribe Called Quest, Basement Jaxx, The Prodigy, The Black Eyed Peas, Carl Cox, DJ Craze, De La Soul, Jazzanova, Felix Da House Cat, Gang Starr, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Mark Rae, Omar, Miguel Migs, Mix Master Mike, DJ Spinna, Moby, Tony Touch, Norman Jay, Public Enemy, Roger Sanchez, Kyoto Jazz Massive just to name a few. In addition to his solo world tours, he has also DJed for bands like the Australian legendary act Regurgitator, the jazz funk fusion band Zephyr Timbre and the electronic Soma Rasa. \r\n\r\nHernandez is also a backbone behind renowned 'Heavy Boogie'  'No Parking on the Dance Floor'  'Audio K'  'Deeper Rhythms'  'Breathe And Stop'  'Laced Up' and the 'Eklektiks' \r\n\r\nEqually at ease playing for small crowds in the dark rooms of London & New York or for large festivals of 50,000 people, one never knows where one will find Kristian next but one thing remains certain - wherever he is, people will be dancing.",

  "artist_bio": "Ingo Vogelmann from Germany is a music producer, DJ, composer, song-writer, audio engineer, label founder and radio show host at friskyRadio. Hopeful romantic, technology geek, perfectionist close to autism, ambitious work-horse in the studio and on the road. You can't really put his work into drawers, no genre will fit really.\r\n\r\nHe's a really bad parachutist, because he's afraid of heights.Ingo Vogelmann didn't find music for his life, it found him. Raised with a grandfather who composed classical works and played 9 instruments, a mother who's a soprano singer and an elder brother who composes and plays 3 instruments as well, going the musical way wasn't really an option but a predetermined way. At age 6 he he had the fortune to be classically educated in playing drums, later his brother taught him to play guitar and piano. To become a producer and DJ was just the logical evolution.\r\n\r\nWhen Ingo Vogelmann is on the decks dancefloors are boiling, clubbers freak out and everyone has a long-lasting smile on his face. Vogelmann knows how the job has to be done. Over two decades in the scene as a DJ and producer, at FRISKY — the number 1 radio station in its field — both as host and crew member from 2005 on, Ingo runs three successful shows on the station: the 8 hours marathon show \"LIGHTWORKS\", the legendary Ambient show \"TIME OUT\" and the \"Release Promo Hype Chart Essentials\" where Ingo showcases the best new material from the most significant promo pool for progressive dance music. From over 200 shows on the station, \"LIGHTWORKS\" has been ranked #4 in 2011, after Nick Warren, Dave Seaman and the \"Artist Of The Week\".\r\n\r\nIngo has established himself as one of the most influential figures in the field of electronic music over the years as both a DJ, and a producer. He's not only an extraordinary and charismatic DJ, but also a workhorse in the studio. 7 albums and over 150 singles and remixes mark his way. Ingo’s known for being a studio wizard, often breaking the boundaries of the possible. Some of his highly remarkable remix works were for the co-producer of Enigma (Jens Gad, and his side project \"Achillea\") and the single \"The Seeress Prophecy\", his remixes for Jane Silence's \"Break Easy,\" Nash Donson's \"Brightness\", PVS's \"Peklow\", or his remixes for the FRISKY Records label.\r\n\r\nIngo currently works on his 8th artist album for which he teamed up with the Danish classical/crossover singer Helene Hørlyck as well as New York City based singer Jane Silence, to create another pioneering work in the field of advanced eletronic music. Also queued up are remixes for the award-winning producer Lee Fletcher and the German label Cirque Du Son.\r\n\r\nThis man and his passion for music can only lead him — and those who are fortunate enough to hear his work — to higher places.",

He had his early education in music in classical piano and listening to Michael Jackson, New Order, Informational Society, Depeche Mode, and U2. Simple as it may seem, this performer carries with him an impressive pedigree.\r\n\r\nJust like most people in the industry, Mike Bolante started as a DJ, working small parties. He then decided to venture into production working with NYC legend, Ray Roc AKA The Roc Project. He managed his label, ROCit Records, which came out with hits such as Never featuring Tina Arena, Playboy Anthem, Jungle Kisses and many more.\r\n\r\nHe then went on his own to earn his stripes in one of the cities that is most populated with DJs and is in fact, THE BIRTHPLACE of HOUSE, Chicago. Toiling for 6 years in the scene, he was exposed to HOUSE as Chicago defines it. He worked with local superheroes such as Michael Serafini, Cz Mirani, Miguel Castro, Gene Farris, Andre Harris, Maurice Joshua, Bill Basil, Lego, Bad Boy Bill, JJ Flores, Kalendr, Inphinity, NORDjs, John Curley.\r\n\r\nHe also discovered his love for Techno and Tech House working for Dino Gardiakos at his world renowned club, Spy Bar. Exposed to sophisticated sounds of Shlomi Aber, Steve Lawler, Loco Dice, Audiofly, Paco Osuna, and many more, his passion for these genres and Chicago house show in his productions, even in commercial remixes.\r\n\r\nTo date, Mike currently is Hyve and Skye's Music Director and no longer the newbie he once was but a veteran that can play almost any genre with his own swagger and identity. His genuine love for music drives him to do music on his own terms. This is what we call PASSION and he has it and will never lose site of it.",

As a group, they played together in famous clubs like MASyMAS, Seveneightorange, C2, and The Basement. Mond played also as an individual in those same clubs playing progressive house.\r\n\r\nFast forward to today, Mond has indeed played in many different clubs around Manila like Warehouse 135, Embassy, Ascend, Alchemy and Dolce playing his brand of deep music. He has also played in Boracay Island and in Cebu City. One of his most memorable gigs was playing at Warehouse 135 at 4:30am up to 6am. He has also achieved a record of playing for 7.3 hours straight without any rest for a Halloween Party of his church group. Presently, Mond's music is deep house to deep techno. He has not lost his \"old school DJing\" skills which he considers as a huge asset.\r\n\r\nMond sees DJing as just a pure hobby being an entrepreneur during the day. His passion for good music is evident in his music choices and mixes. And to Mond, he believes that there is no end to the learning curve when it comes to mixing.",

  "artist_bio": "\"...after just a few minutes of hearing her spin, I knew immediately that she was my type of DJ. Mixing seamlessly between funky breaks, soulful house, hip hop, broken beat & bass tunes, she clearly had a keen sense of what works on the dancefloor.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Planet (Bastard Jazz/NYC)In times where DJs are often abused as “glorified jukeboxes” forced to play “what the crowd wants & when they want it” BadKiss decided that would not be her fate. “A great DJ does not always have to give the people what they want and when they want it! A great DJ feels the room and reads the crowd. He creates a atmosphere and plays material his audience needs to hear. He will play music that is relevant and current without forgetting that he is there to rock the party.”\r\nBadKiss is an open-format DJ. She selects music depending on the theme of the night, the crowd, and the atmosphere of the venue. Very few DJs in the Manila scene can claim to be as versatile and versed in so many different styles of music as this girl is. She can play anything from 70s Disco, Funk and Soul to classic 90s and soulful contemporary Hip Hop, Dance Hall & Reggae, Afro beat & Latin rhythms to NuJazz, Broken Beat, UK Garage & Bass music to Soulful, Deep & Classic House. \r\nBadKiss has been playing the Manila club scene since almost 10 years now. She is the longest running resident DJ of M Cafe and has like no other DJ shaped M cafe’s reputation for being Manila’s prime spot to enjoy soulful, funky and current music. Her residency at M cafe included “Gotsoul” Fridays feat DJs BadKiss & Kristian Hernandez in association with Dj Jojoflores and Gotsoul (Montreal), which ran succesfully from 2010 to 2012.\r\nFestivals that BadKiss has played include the Malasimbo Music&Arts Festival 2011, 2012 & 2013 where she performed along side stellar artists Joss Stone, Jimmy Cliff & Joe Bataan; and the first Manila Music Festival 2012 featuring the legendary Afrika Bambataa.\r\nIn 2012 BadKiss proved her musical versatility, holding her own warming up the crowd for Hip Hop legends Ali Shaheed Muhammad (ATCQ), Maseo (De La Soul), DJ ShortKut (ISP), DJ Vinroc & DJ Apollo (TripleThreat) and Tony Touch. These performances were part of a SEAsian wide activation campaign for global brand heavyweight xAdidas Originals in cooperation with Heavy Boogie Entertainment.\r\nBeing based in Manila, Philippines hasn’t stopped BadKiss from reaching a worldwide audience. Her mixes have been publicized on the highly influential BamaLoveSoul blog and Captain Planet’s Mixtaperiot. She has also contributed featured mixes to the international Radio show “Soulsearching with Michael Ruetten”, making her the first and up to date only artist in the history of the show to be featured in consecutive episodes. Another international radio station that has aired a BadKiss live mix is Ibiza Global Radio. \r\nThis young ladies vast musical repertoire and talent have led to her playing with world class artists from all corners of the musical spectrum. In recent years these have included DJ Spinna, Kyoto Jazz Massive, Juergen von Knoblauch (Jazzanova), Telepopmusik, Opolopo, Jaime XX, Jojoflores, DJ Dusty, DJ Krush, DJ Neil Armstrong & Captain Planet. \r\nThe list keeps expanding as she continues in the pursuit of serving up only Quality Music to her audience.",

Awarded “Zouk's Favorite Resident DJ” in 2010 in a poll done to celebrate the club’s 19th Anniversary, djB has been consistently pushing his unique big room “four on the floor” sound in Zouk for the last decade, a deed which has led him to guest spot across the globe in world renowned clubs such as Pacha (Ibiza), Womb (Toyko), Space (Ibiza) and Mass (Seoul). With more than 8 singles, 3 compilation mixes and 3 remixes released through international labels such as Defected, Soulfuric, Reversoulmusic, Look At You, Map Dance, SSOH, and Azuli, and having received support for his work from luminaries like Roger Sanchez, Martin Solveig and Copyright, djB takes a brand new step this 2011 with his very own imprint, F1rstrecords/O4M, done together with Spanish DJ/Producer Danny Marquez.  With a shared vision, the duo strives to keep ahead of the market as champions in delivering cutting edge and progressive electronic dance music. The future is looking bright for this one.",

Building a forte in sound design, he is best described as a sound futurist. His identical rhythmic structure and compositional techniques which incorporate elements of techno, tight sub bass, ambient and IDM delivers a hint of chaotic soundscape amidst artistry. A Singaporean by birth and residence, he independently released \"Xycle\", a self-promotional ep that made the industry to stand up to take notice, in early 2003. He then followed with his debut album, \"Supersonicstate\" the following year. \r\n\r\nIn 2006, his talent has been discovered by a German independent record label Meerestief. With a remix that he has done for Dublin's Five Green Circle's track entitled Ronan's BBQ has created a storm over Europe. Praised, supported and charted by heavy weights from the world of electronic music. 3 years later, Xhin found a new home. He joined Berlin's then new techno label, Stroboscopic Artefacts to release his dark, intense and experimental side of things. This will be yet again the beginning of an old new direction for him to explore and experiment sounds even deeper for his future releases.",

Over the\r\nyears, his love for these styles has defined his musical point of view\r\nwith him taking these influences and blending them with the most\r\nupfront sounds in today's dance music.Reading a crowd and adapting to each gig, while still standing true to his musical roots comes naturally to him. It’s\r\nall about taste and point of view for this veteran jock, sticking to his philosophy of, “…is more about what you\r\ndecide what you won’t play that defines you as a true DJ / Artist… anyone can whack some anthems together but\r\nshaping a set and taking your audience on a journey that they won’t forget, that’s something I always aim for… of\r\ncourse while staying true to what I believe is quality music\".\r\n\r\nCarrying a torch for Soul-inspired music be it House, Disco, Rare Groove or Funk, or exploring his more techier alter-ego, with melodic techno and tech house he continues to helm the decks each the weekend at Zouk's upscale House club, Velvet Underground along side Jeremy Boon. He has shared the stage with Lindstrom, Midnight Juggernauts, Seth Troxler, Dubfire and Dennis Ferrer at Zouk's 10th Anniversary ZoukOut (2010) Festival and has played warm up sets for the likes of Joris Voorn, Tiefschwarz, Anja Schneider, Agoria, Paul Kalkbrenner as well as at Gilles Peterson’s Worldwide Festiva (Singapore)l in 2009 & 2010.",

His break arrived in ’99 when he was offered a residency at the New Park Hotel Nightclub. Playing anything from Retro, House to Rock & Roll, it was here that he honed his technique to precision. \r\n\r\nAs Y2K rolled around, he moved on from hotel clubs to the Boat Quay and Mohd Sultan circuit which were packed with nightspots and the ‘Place To be’ for the younger generation. \r\n\r\nLocal residencies & guest slots;\r\nPier 69 \r\nCoral & Shell \r\nTaps\r\nCrazy Horse\r\nOosh \r\nFuse \r\nThe Page\r\nThe Next Page \r\nHideout\r\nHomeClub \r\nHouse \r\nBQ Bar\r\n\r\n\r\nInternational gigs \r\n\r\nTasmania, Australia\r\nHalo\r\nPlan B\r\nSyrup\r\nThe Telegraph Hotel\r\nCurly's\r\n\r\nKoh Phangan, Thailand\r\nTommy’s\r\n\r\nBali, Indonesia\r\nF-lounge \r\nRum..Hailing from Singapore, DJ Adam C has graced decks all around Asia. From the magnificent Club West End in Goa, India, Full Moon Parties on infamous Haad Rin beach in Thailand to Bali’s F-lounge, his exploits in Hobart include the funky fresh New Skool Theory nights at old warehouse Halo, DMS nights in Syrup, El Partido nights by young gun Billy Green as well as the highly successful BPM nights organised by Shadwick. Without a doubt, his uncanny, inimitable style will continue to move dance floors all around the world! \r\n\r\nSpanning a wide variety of genres, his tastes range from dreamy downtempo to psychedelic rock, dubby minimal to funky house. Growing up listening to DJ's like Sasha, John Digweed and Aldrin, the epic progressive vibes and bewitching melodies along with tribal elements and grooving hypnotic basslines are ever present as when he weaves magic with wax.\r\n\r\nWith roots as an avid clubber, this experience sharpened his musical tastes and blessed him with the innate ability to make a dance floor groove or a chillout room chill, he believes that as technology becoming more readily available, electronic music has expanded and will continue to grow. It’s easy to get stuck pigeonholing music into genres. Most vital is that you know what sounds good to you, stay true to yourself. And DANCE! \r\n",

Coupled with his Essential Mix set making him the only South East Asian to be on Pete's show, plus Danny Tenaglia singling him out as a DJ to watch, Aldrin is clearly an international DJ/producer that Asia can call their very own.One of Asia’s internationally prominent DJ, Aldrin has been at the forefront of Asia’s dance music scene, flying the Singapore flag throughout the four corners of the world, garnering acclaim at every stop from press, punters and fellow DJs alike. Over the last two decades, he has been a musical ambassador to the infamous Zouk Club in Singapore – while running his very own digital label – OneWithMusic, amidst a barrage of remixes and releases on other international labels.\r\n\r\nAldrin’s global profile is bolstered by the reputation he commands on home turf, clinching the Best DJ vote again at the I-S Magazine Readers' Choice Awards 2013, and cited by British dance music magazine Muzik as “One of the world’s finest residents”. Having played a crucial role in building up the vibrant dance scene in Singapore, Aldrin continues to pack out his headline night “ONE with Aldrin” with faithful fans.\r\n\r\nPrior to this, Aldrin’s plaudit list was already nothing short of impressive, starting the millennium as the only Asian to be featured as DJ of the Month and being named “a contender for Best New DJ” in UK’s Dance Magazine Muzik. Following that, he became the first Asian DJ to appear on the cover of Muzik, with credit for mixing the magazine’s “most on-form” covermount CD. Thereafter, Aldrin was invited to do a 2-hour guest mix for Pete Tong’s world-renowned Essential Mix radio show, making him the only South East Asian to be featured on the show. All these, along with superstar DJ Danny Tenaglia singling him out as his Future DJ Hero in DJ Mag’s Top 100 poll, has propelled Aldrin onto the international platform.\r\n\r\nConsistently thrilling crowds of thousands with his flawless, versatile sets, Aldrin has taken his sound all over Asia, Europe, and North America, to top clubs such as Pacha in Ibiza, London’s Ministry Of Sound, Ceilo i n New York, Tokyo's Womb, and Seoul's Ellui. Aldrin was also nominated as “Best New Comer” for the Ibiza DJ Awards in 2004, while Muzik Magazine referred him as Asia’s NUMBER ONE DJ to catch in Ibiza, where he continues his presence every summer.\r\n\r\nIn the studio, Aldrin’s productions a n d r e m i x e s have not gone unnoticed. Releases on international imprints like Renaissance, Great Stuff, Ware , Baroque, System Recordings, and his own OneWithMusic imprint, have all received rave reviews, and were charted and playlisted by topdogs like Carl Cox, John Digweed, Pete Tong, Paul Oakenfold, Laurent Garnier, Trentemoller, Stacey Pullen, to name but a few.\r\n\r\nNot one to rest on his laurels, Aldrin has also dabbled in Theatre, performing a 2-night sold- out concert with local heroes the T'ang Quartet, and was also commissioned to be the Music Arranger for Singapore's National Day Parade (NDP2013).\r\n\r\nRefusing to follow the mainstream commercial herd, 2014 saw Aldrin continuing his quest to maintain some quality music in the Singapore club scene via his “ONE with Aldrin” brand, favouring a Deep House/ Tech House/ Techno playlist. Apart from relaunching his ONE night at the current hot spot Kyo, the 2nd half of 2014 also saw him play headline sets at Koh Phangan's Jungle Experience, Full Steam Ahead at Singapore's Tanjong Beach Club, the Freq'ender Festival, and the massive ZoukOut.\r\n\r\nConcurrently, Aldrin has also been championing a Nu Disco/ Indie Dance soundtrack through his much sought-after sets on local radio Lush 99.5FM, and via the Singapore Island Culture Club (SICC) parties at Kyo , the DISCO:VERY nights at Zouk's Velvet Underground, plus various intimate venues around the region.",

  "artist_bio": "The Time Has Come For Those Who Are Different To Stand United...A DJ / Producer with his roots stemming from dance music the other side of the 4/4 norm, Tony hailed as the Ambassador of Breaks in Asia, is a man of constant reinvention. Having joined Zouk in 1996, Tony Tay firmly found his place in Phuture, churning out dance music the other side of the 4/4 norm. Tony stays adamant and dedicated to pushing the boundaries with his residency nights, “Sirens”. He has also been credited in the album releases of Hybrid, Tayo, Hyper, Ali B and Evil Nine for his contribution in spreading the Breakbeat gospel.\r\n\r\nFrom 1999 through 2010, Sirens has been synonymous with the sonic realms of Breaks, Beats and Beyond. It was originally a series of parties thrown on a whim. Most notably, the longest-standing Breaks night in Asia, Sirens continues to break new ground; playing a cross section of Phat, Rockish, Driving and Tech Funk sounds, along with a broad spectrum of cutting edge Electronic dance music. “Sirens” has also gone a notch higher to give the local clubbing massive, an enhanced party experience with the accompaniment of live visuals to Tony’s electrifying soundscapes.  It has now amassed a following of its own bringing out local talents as well as showcasing international artists like, Adam Freeland, Evil Nine, Future Funk Squad, General Midi, Hybrid, Hyper, Koma & Bones, Meat Katie and Tayo just to name but a few.\r\n\r\nTony has produced several tracks of his own which have been aired on Angus Robinson’s Proton Radio show on Money Shot Radio, Peter Paul’s show on ibreaks Radio and on DJ Icey - Automatic Static Radio Show (BoomBox Channel 34) which broadcasts on Sirius Satellite that covers all of North America and Hawaii.\r\n\r\nStaying true to his nature of not holing himself into any particular genre, Tony's definition of sound fuses a matrix of house music's sub-genres that merge groovy riffs, deft percussion, driving bass-lines and a host of surprises that are elemental to his sets both locally and globally. His electrifyingly forward-thinking sets have seen him play along side the likes of artists like Dubfire, James Zabiela, John Digweed, Ken Ishii, Loco Dice, Luciano, Miss Kittin, Nic Fanciulli, Reboot, Richie Hawtin, Sasha, Sven Vath, and a host of many others.  \r\n\r\nHis spacey, riding grooves bear testimony to why he is so instrumental in the development of electronic music in this part of the World. Branching out on his own now following a 14 year residency at the globally renowned Zouk Club, in Singapore, the world is a no-holds-barred place for a talent like Tony Tay. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.djtonytay.com\r\nhttp://www.soundcloud.com/tonytay\r\nhttp://dj.beatport.com/tonytay",

Recognition of his tastemaker status, further solidified with his contribution to the triple-CD mix ‘Zouk In The House’ on Defected Records (2008), regular features on Japan's Modaista J-Wave 81.3FM, overseas gigs at music meccas such as Winter Music Conference, Amsterdam Dance Event, Ibiza, Gilles Peterson’s Worldwide Festival (Sete) prove why he is one of Gilles Peterson’s favorite DJs.\"But you guys (Zouk) have got pretty good DJs, like Jeremy Boon for example, who I would have to play in my\r\nclub in London. He’s really good and he´s really into his thing and he´s a much better mixer than me! Technically and musically, he´s shit hot and he has got a good vibe!\"- Gilles Peterson, Juice Magazine (Singapore), November 2002\r\n\r\nJeremy Boon’s love affair with House music started in 1991 when Asia’s premier electronic music club Zouk\r\nopened its doors to the public. Or rather, it was the public opening their hearts and minds to Jeremy Boon’s\r\nchoice selection of House beats when he helmed the decks in the club’s main room. Not only defining Zouk’s early sounds, but also pushing the boundaries of House music in its various guises be it Jazz, Afro Beat, Latin, Soul or Funk inspired tunes, Jeremy has grown musically, establishing his residency at Velvet Underground (since 1997) with his signature style of eclectic tunes.\r\n\r\nRecognition of his tastemaker status has been solidified with regular features on Japan's Modaista J-Wave\r\n81.3FM, Singapore electronic music radio station, LUSH 99.5 FM and even a spot on the revered Worldwide\r\nShow on BBC Radio One. His contribution to Zouk In The House Mixed Compilation on Defected Records and\r\nsharing the spotlight with a multitude of superstar DJs (Norman Jay, Louie Vega, Laurent Garnier, Jazzanova) as well as helming overseas gigs at dance music meccas such as Ibiza, Japan & more recently at Gilles Peterson’s Worldwide Festival in Sete (June 2010), Jeremy’s music resume and fan base has certainly grown by leaps & bounds. Well, guess one cannot expect anything less from Gilles Peterson’s favourite DJ!",

Drop the tunes. Create a story. It’s a hobby, an addiction if you wanna call it. I love the vibe of being a clubber too. I think it goes hand in hand. When I’m behind the decks, I try to do one thing. Create a singular experience for the ears, feet, mind, body & soul.”\r\n\r\nartihc (real name “Firman Chitra”) , the crowned JUICE DJ QUEST 09 CHAMPION, hails from Singapore and has been dropping choons to both the commercially pampered and discerning ears for the past 13 years. A junglist at heart, he has since the last few years, taken his love for the universal language to various level, with Deep House, House, Minimal, Tech House and Techno as his new soundscapes, joining the league of his usual sound of Drum & Bass, Breaks, Broken beat, Triphop and Down Tempos.\r\n\r\nMusic enables his soul to speak. You feel him when you hear him and you immediately understand the passion, love and respect he has for music. Growing up in a musical family has inevitably made him learn the art of appreciation for all types of music, from classical to pop, from electronic to dance. Once he was exposed to the clubs and parties, he couldn’t get enough of the beats. He was hooked immediately to the vibe, the crowd, the atmosphere,\r\nthe exhilaration of it all. The impact of these experiences energized him and he knew one day he wanted to be able to contribute to this realm.\r\n\r\nIt was only a matter of time before he earned his first dj set-up and began practicing the art of mixing. Naturally from being just a club raver, he ventured from a Bedroom DJ, to Djs for house parties, events and eventually to established clubs and bars. His focus is always about the feeling and the realness of the music and it’s hidden message. There, he’ll put on a carefully\r\nselected track, and gladly take you all with him, with his silent technical wizardry.\r\n\r\nNever just settling for what’s current and popular, he fuses the underground sound with the chart-busters and floorfillers, uprising you with his soulful and melodic rhythms that slips in between the deep and techy beats of his deep house, house, tech house, minimal or techno.\r\n\r\nWhen not messing around with AV cables and working on his original productions, artihc can be found regularly dropping beats at various music meccas in Singapore. With gigs at Home Club, Overeasy, thewhiterabbit, the shack, Art Bar, Azzura Beach Club, Shine Club (Colombo, Sri Lanka), Velvet Underground (Zouk), Oceans27 (Bali), plus clinching the most sought-after title within the first year since his return to the club scene, this is just the beginning of his aural\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccolades:\r\n\r\n2009 Juice DJ Quest CHAMPION (Singapore)\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Mentions:\r\n\r\nBalanceFM Podcast\r\nElectrocaine Podcast\r\nFoundation KL\r\nFrontalLabs\r\nInsing.sg\r\nIS Magazine, Singapore\r\nJUICE (SG) Magazine\r\nJUICE (KL) Magazine\r\nMESHRADIO Podcast\r\nMidnight Shift Website\r\nMinimalaysia Podcast\r\nPioneer KUVO : Pioneer DJ\r\nStellar Music Digital Podcast\r\n\r\nVenues & Events:\r\n\r\nArt Bar (Butter Factory, Singapore)\r\nAzzura Beach Club, Singapore\r\nBlue Jazz, Singapore\r\nBedroom, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\r\nF1 Podium Lounge 2010 (Ritz Carlton Hotel, Singapore)\r\nGLOW Club, Bangkok, Thailand\r\nHomeClub, Singapore\r\nJUICE 11th Anniversary Party, Zouk, Singapore\r\nKinki Rooftop Bar, Singapore\r\nKudeta, Singapore (SkyBar)\r\nKudeta, Singapore (Club)\r\nKudeta, Bangkok\r\nKyo, Singapore\r\nLoof, Singapore\r\nLUCKY 13, Singapore\r\nMadMonks, Singapore\r\nMaria Magdalena, Bali, Indonesia\r\nNYE at Oceans27, Bali\r\nOvereasy Bar, Singapore\r\nOne Rochester, Singapore\r\nRebel, Singapore\r\nSHINE Club, Colombo, Sri Lanka\r\nSupperclub, Singapore\r\nSingapore Art Museum, Singapore\r\nThe SHACK, Singapore\r\nTanjong Beach Club, Singapore\r\nThe White Rabbit, Singapore\r\nTheMixingRoom, Avalon, Singapore\r\nThe Vault, Singapore\r\nVUtopia, Velvet Underground (Zouk, Singapore)\r\nWoobar (W Bali, Seminyak)\r\nYing Yang, Singapore\r\nZIRCA, Singapore\r\n..\r\nEmail: artihc.sg@gmail.com\r\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/firmanchitra\r\nSoundcloud: soundcloud.com/artihc/",

It was also signed to the massive Dream Dance Vol 45 compilation-Germany’s biggest compilation series as well as the prestigious “Delirium” compilation from Dave Pearce. \r\n\r\nThe current track \"Island Of Dreams\" signed to Fektive is available from  BeatPort and TrackItDown as a featured release. \r\n\r\nGraham also recently remixed Pierre Pienaar's track 'If your not here' and has a new compilation album ’Submerge’ for Fektive out in October.  \r\n\r\nSince his relocation to Koh Phangan, Thailand, Graham is playing at Full Moon and Half Moon parties. The change in environment has also led to a change in style. Although it was trance that made him a DJ Mag Top 100 DJ for 7 years and his world wide syndicated Radio Show TranceDayze continues to goes out on leading stations and portals around the globe, many of his sets now are house (covering all the genres) based, and he has reflected this new style in his latest compilation CD.\r\n\r\nBut don’t worry!! The energy is still there, the music is still totally fresh, and he builds a set perfectly.\r\n\r\nJust expect something a little different this time..'Submerge'\r\n\r\nHe was personally requested to remix “Latin Theme” by Carl Cox!! \r\n\r\nHe has been in the DJ Mag Top 100 7 out of the last 12 years (2 years at 22 and 5 inside the Top 40), its no wonder clubbers and the industry call him a legend!! He was also voted Best Trance DJ at the Underground Music Awards in 2003, and won every accolade in the Kiss 100 Awards for many years beating dj's such as Judge Jules and Danny Rampling.\r\n\r\nGraham has sold over 700,000 mix albums across various leading brands including Kiss Mix, Kiss in Ibiza, Retrospective Of House, Club Cuts, Dj’s In The Box and his own albums Gold & Delicious for Logic/BMG, GG1/GG2 for Trust The DJ, Worth It’s Weight In Gold for Bullion, and Full Of Beans for Urban Collective.There have also been covermount CD’s for M8 Magazine and Fast Car.\r\n\r\nGraham’s My Space can be accessed via www.grahamgold.com and has achieved over 70,000 hits and his bi-weekly podcasts are going out to a regular 6000 signed up database and growing weekly. \r\n\r\nHis Facebook group  GRAHAM GOLD EVENTS  already has over 2000 members which get mailed about all Graham’s upcoming gigs.\r\n\r\nFor 14 years, Graham travelled to every corner of the globe, wowing club goers with his passion for music. There is probably not a country he hasn’t played in. But things change and Graham knew he had to do more to stay on top of his game. So he cut back on the gigs and bought a studio. 3 years later, learning to produce on his own, he is now turning out tracks that are played by the world’s elite. \r\n\r\nHe has run highly successful labels such as  Good As label which gave Mat Darey his first ever UK top twenty single, Koolworld which spawned the massive “Invader” and secured 3 top 20 hits on his Peach/PWL label.\r\n\r\nGood As also managed the UK diaries of Tiesto, Armin and Ferry Corsten from 1998-2001.\r\nThis is what Chris Hampshire, the MD of Recoverworld had to say: \r\n\r\n“Graham Gold's influence on dance music today cannot be understated.  A true industry pioneer he has played at every club that is worth playing at and his radio show on Kiss helped to define musical the tastes of a generation. He continues to draw in new fans week in week out with his hectic DJ schedule. With such a depth of musical knowledge and influences his productions are always something special and his debut single on Flux continues in this vein.”\r\n\r\nGraham was the first DJ/promoter book Armin van Buuren, Ferry Corsten, Tiesto and The Flash Brothers into the UK.\r\n\r\nHe appears regularly in every leading dance music publication and was even featured in the special GOLD edition of Vogue!!\r\n\r\n You'll also find Graham on: \r\n Facebook \r\n MySpace \r\n Vkontakte.ru \r\n Hi5.com \r\n HarderFaster.net \r\n ResidentAdvisor.net  \r\n\r\nContact: graham@grahamgold.com  \r\nPHONE: THAILAND +66 (0) 89 2345 201 \r\nSKYPE U.K. +44(0) 208 8133 7574\r\nFor press/bookings jackie@grahamgold.com  \r\n\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "DJ/PRODUCER/BROADCASTERBorn 1977 in Örebro, Sweden; The Outsider bought his first pair of Technics at the age of 14 to pursuit his love for Hip Hop. It didn't take long before he got so influenced by this music and the culture surrounding it that he decided to move to the US. At the age of 16, The Outsider bought a one way ticket to Columbus, Ohio; where he had been offered to play on local radio station KBUX 91.1. With\r\nthe exposure from the radio and a reputation for skillful and innovative mixing, The Outsider soon began to play at various clubs and events. Being in Ohio, it didn't take long before he was introduced to the futuristic sounds coming from the neighbouring state of Michigan, mainly Detroit, and the Hip Hop vinyl was soon to give space for House and Techno. The Outsider spent three years playing events on the east coast of America alongside names such as Christian Smith, Alexi Delano and Titonton Duvanté. Highlights included performing at the legendary Phryl events in Toronto and up-state New York. \r\n\r\nWhen the NY-scene gradually began to fade after the mid nineties, The Outsider decided to move back to Europe in 1997 with his aim set on London. Once there, he quickly got back into broadcasting and began co-hosting a world renowned techno show on Interface Radio alongside Alan Ritchie. Guests included Adam Beyer, Ben Sims, Billy Nasty, Joel Mull, Transparent Sounds and Mark Broom. With the success from the radio show under his belt, The Outsider began to play various clubs and events around London and in August 2000 he started his own weekly house night at Plus-Minus. At this point he had also been resident DJ at the Gattaca warehouse parties for over a year and was playing regularly at Carl Cox's Ultimate B.A.S.E. nights at The Velvet Rooms and at The End alongside Carl Cox, Trevor Rockcliffe, Jim Masters, Colin Dale and Jamie Anderson.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, The Outsider founded the ReGenerate collective and became the first international DJ to play in Kosovo since the war had ended. This year also brought along two trips to Sao Paulo, Brazil, where one of his DJ mixes had been voted 'mix of the year' on Anderson Noise's Radio Noise. It was also around this time that he teamed up with Swedish techno producer Christopher Benjamin to form a live act. The highlight of this collaboration was playing Bugged Out with Mr C and Tom Middleton. The Outsider has since played in many European countries including Sweden, UK, Germany Switzerland and Portugal as well as Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam in Asia. Back in London he was playing clubs such as Fabric, Ministry of Sound, 1001, SE1 and was organizing The Drop at Bar 54 with Chris Finke; playing alongside names such as Oliver Ho, James Ruskin, Phil Kieran, Ken Ishii, DJ Rolando, Stacey Pullen and Derrick May.\r\n\r\nSince 2010 The Outsider is living in Bangkok, where he is on the forefront of the underground music scene. DJ'ing extensively and organising events under his own Outsider Music Group brand and together with Felix Moreno under the 52hz moniker. The Outsider is behind notorious events such as Berlin Beats, Shapes Ltd, Tech-Noir, Red Zone, High Tech Soul and Common Ground. He's also well\r\nknown for his monthly ReGenerate radio show on UB Radio and the Roots to Present podcast series. The Outsider has brought artists like Steve Rachmad, Agaric, Oliver Ho, James What, Tomoki Tamura and TrusMe to the Thai capital and has become synonymous with quality underground house and techno throughout south east Asia.",

  "artist_bio": "With a keen ear for quality and a back catalogue of his own musical production, Koko journeyed from the steamy streets of Chiang Mai Thailand to pursue his love of electronic music at its source. Now based in Berlin, Koko Sripakdee spent ten years spinning tunes in London, rocking legendary venues with his distinctive sets.Koko first encountered electronic music as a youth in Thailand, sparking a life-long love affair. Chasing the sound across the seas, Koko moved to London and after spending most of his days holed up with nothing but his turntables and record box for company, Koko got his first big break at Brick Lane’s Exit Bar. \r\n\r\nShortly after this he was made resident DJ at TSQ Bar Putney. From 2005 to 2014 Koko entertained the masses at TSQ every weekend, but he continued to play on the London DJ circuit. In 2008 Koko became a resident at 54 Bar Commercial Street playing the finest techno, tech-house and minimal in his weekly Sunday slot.\r\n\r\nIn 2014 Koko followed his passion to Berlin, home of techno, and became a regular face behind the decks at renowned musical hotspot Heinz Schüftan in Neukölln, appearing frequently on line ups for their Chapeau Klack Friday parties. Since then Koko has joined line ups for the Berlin chapter of the underground Toronto party crew, Box Of Kittens, at their regular parties at Griessmühle. \r\n\r\nKoko has made appearances at Tante Ema Berlin, Egg London, Rhythm Factory, Dropeast Bar, Apples & Pears Shoreditch, Inigo Bar, Cafe CMBC Thailand and Warm Up Cafe in his hometown of Chiang Mai, while in the summer of 2012 Koko rocked the main stage at the massive Festa della Musica in Milan, Italy. \r\n\r\nKoko's productions have been released on Opensource Records and Cinetique Recordings (available on Beatport), and these days he can be found bringing his own style of music to discerning Berlin clubbers in the party capital of the world.",

As years progressed his interest shifted to funk and soulful house which became also obvious in his musical choices on stage. Currently his style can best described as a righteous mix between UK garage, funky techno and nu disco music.\r\nOld school is a term that suits Dennis well as he is one of those few DJs who still spins vinyl whenever he gets a chance. In his record bag you’ll always find a nice extra set of drum n bass, break beats, jungle and even reggae classics.",

He decided to set camp inside the dark recesses of Fabric, where his musical style is heavily influenced from. TipTap has since founded various internet radio stations which he has used as an output to push his eclectic musical taste to a wide audience. Playing gigs around the UK and with a successful show on Belgium's Warm FM, his passion for electronic music later led him to Berlin. Much like London, most of his time there was spent record shopping and techno dancing. TipTap comes to Bangkok not only with a large amount of vinyl, but also with a musical commitment.",

  "artist_bio": "Thai country girl turning global icon - this unique fairytale of the 21st century describes the career of Nakadia with a few words. Nakadia is loved for her music as much as for her personality and she is out to conquer the world with her strong tech tunesGrowing up without running water in a rural village in Thailand meant the harsh realities of a poor life left no chance for a career in electronic music. However, after being invited to Germany in 2002, one night clubbing changed all that and filled her with a spark that transformed her life into what it is today:\r\n\r\nNAKADIA - one of the world’s very few globally successful female electronic music artists.\r\n\r\nFresh from the buzz of that night, Nakadia took turntables home to Thailand and started shaping her craft. Unguided by other DJs and with no club scene for inspiration, she practiced relentlessly to develop her own sound. It was only when she moved to the Thai island of Koh Samui in 2003 where she came into contact\r\nwith a small electronic music scene and got some first practice in playing for European tourists.\r\n\r\nNakadia’s first years as a DJ were all about the growth of her personal sound and style. By 2004, her first year as a full time DJ, she already performed 55 gigs across 12 countries. Over the next four years Nakadia found herself in the sounds of Deep House, Tech House and Techno. Ever since, this lovely young Thai girl has been bringing her underground sounds to the dance floors of legendary venues like “Watergate“ Berlin, “Cafe D Anvers“ Antwerp, “The Egg“ London, “D Edge“ Sao Paulo, “Lola“ Shanghai, and “Glow“ Bangkok, just to name a few. \r\n\r\nANTS - one of Ibiza’s top events - heard about Nakadia and invited her for a first set at Ushuaia. After the incredible reaction, Nakadia is now part of the ANTS colony on Ibiza. \r\n\r\nWith a huge portion of raw talent, fearless mixing, but most of all her incredible energy, she turns every doubter into a Nakadia-lover. Without a big label behind her name and no top manager pulling the strings, her success is purely self-made, based on the results she delivers both in the DJ booth as in the studio. In a time where labels matter more than anything, Nakadia proves that quality tunes and genuine love for music can make the difference. \r\n\r\nOn February 7, 2015 Nakadia will host no other than legendary Sven Väth on the beach of Koh Samui. Back where it all started she will set a milestone for her career. people are flying in from all corners of the world for this special event that will set new standards for clubbing Thailand.\r\n\r\nThe relentless pace of her touring made it hard for Nakadia to find studio time early in her career. Step-by-step she released first tracks in 2005 and 2008. But it wasn’t until 2012 when she chose to focus more on production before her tracks really took off. Nakadia scored her first big club hit during summer of 2013 with her “Check&Run” EP on Clarisse records. The illustrious TECHNASIA supported with\r\na remix and this tune remained in the Beatport Techno top 40 for 12 weeks. During 2014 Nakadia devoted more time to the studio and the resulting EP’s will be available from January 2015 onwards. Her next highlight is a project with legendary GEORGE MOREL, scheduled for release on Get Physical Music at the beginning of 2015.\r\n\r\nWith far over 100 high profile bookings across the world each year Nakadia is already going strong.... But these are just the opening chapters of a truly unique career that so far has been nothing short of a\r\nmusical fairytale.",

  "artist_bio": "Andrea Bertrand is a House Music DJ with great Techno and Progressive influences.He was born in a small town in the northwest coast of Italy, where he has always been fascinated by the night life and music.\r\nAt the age of 14, his brother Davide brought home a new pair of turntables and a very old mixer, thus Andrea started to bother the whole neighborhood with heavy bass drums.\r\nAfter a few years, a tipping point for the young DJ occurred; he got out from the comfort of his bedroom and started performing at tea-dance parties. At that time the Trance-Hardstyle wave was hitting the clubs around, and Andrea was spinning his vinyls at 140bpm.\r\n\r\nAfter a while House Music and Tribal sounds began to take over those old school’s hard beats, consequently Andrea’s DJ-sets have been influenced by 126bpm tunes, with warm basslines, guitars and vocals.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, he moved from the craziest rave parties to the cozy beach-side bars, where he was spinning every Friday night. Andrea also spent a few years between France and Spain, where he grew interested in Music Production and Sound Research, then in 2008 he moved to Thailand and realized that Bangkok was the perfect place to complete his studies and develop his projects.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 2009 he graduated as an Audio Engineer from the famous SAE Institute with flying colors. After a while he began to play at Bed Supperclub, the most famous Club, Bar, Restaurant, Art Gallery in Bangkok.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Andrea owns a modest studio where he prepares his own sounds, and throws parties around Bangkok. His DJ-Sets are best described as a dynamic mix of fresh House and Techno, where exuberant bass lines and gorgeous vocals are the main features.\r\n\r\nYou might have seen him performing in bars and restaurants such as Cafe DEMOC, Lo-Shu, Black Pagoda, Wine I love you, or clubs like Glow, Club Culture, Bed Supperclub in Bangkok and Team Club Martini’s parties in Chiang Mai.\r\n\r\nHe also organizes his own monthly event \"Cafe DEMOC is our HOUSE\" which of course takes place at Cafe DEMOC, the most popular underground-garage venue in Bangkok.\r\n\r\nYou can find Andrea Bertrand playing at BED Supperclub (Bangkok) every Friday and Saturday in the restaurant side, and monthly at Glow.\r\n\r\nFind out more: www.andreabertrand.com and become a fan!\r\nFor booking please email: booking@andreabertrand.com",

In his first year, he has been performing in top venues in Vietnam beside international artists. It hasn’t taken long for Pe Dro to become a well-known name in the clubbing circuit. His explosive sets, combining his Techno past influences with the deepest and emotive sounds from the present, has gained him a strong following in the expat community and with local Vietnamese partygoers alike. During last year, he did warm up sets for Henry Saiz, NT89, Sebastian Gamboa or Wally Lopez just to mention few.\r\n\r\nHis constant growth enables him to bring his music to a wide range of audiences. Recently he took one step further in his technique evolution, becoming one of the few in the world to use the exclusive “Smithson & Martin Emulator,” a combination of MIDI software and touch screen hardware – a piece of advanced equipment that shocks people with its vanguard look and limitless possibilities.",
