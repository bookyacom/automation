At the age of 13 he already owned his frst turntables and mixer and started buying records in his favourite recordstore: USA Import in Antwerp.\r\n\r\nWhen he was about the age of 15 he started playing at small local parties close by home and got in contact with a lot of great people and got him playing in and around Antwerp city very fast.\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the years AKIRA has played at venues and events like: Laundry day '08, Café D'Anvers, Tomorrowland '09, Pukkelpop '09, Café Capital, OckxFest '10, Wax Club Bxl, Kissinger...\r\n\r\nAnd he has also shared the decks with a lot of great artists such as: Ben klock, Slam, Ramon Tapia, Let's Go Outside, The Youngsters, Rick Angel, Ed!t, Steve Cop, Kash, Roland Casper, Paul Chambers, Dexter W, Turntable Dubbers, DJ Prinz, Merdan Taplak, Pierre and many more...",

Well known for their solo achievements, together Arches are an exciting new act, ready and primed to take centre stage.\r\n\r\nEarly support has come from The Magician, who on Magic Tape Thirty Three introduced their soon to be released debut track ‘There’s A Place’ (originally titled ‘Higher’). Not content with just one play, The Magician personally requested new Arches’ music, premiering ‘Hurtin’ on Magic Tape Thirty Four.\r\n\r\nThis summer, the pair released a sublime new work from an unlikely source, reworking Whitney Houston’s ‘It’s Not Right But It’s Okay’. Bringing the emotion to the fore, Arches stamped their soon-to-be signature sounds across Whitney’s pitched down vocals. Once premiered by Earmilk, national radio play followed across Europe, North America, Australia and from BBC Radio 1.\r\n\r\nTaking their sound to the stage, Winter 2013 will see Arches perform both DJ and live shows joined by vocalist and songwriter, Gustaph (Hercules & The Love Affair). The performances will be a showcase of Arches’ productions and remixes with live vocals from Gustaph. With their debut appearance confirmed at Belgium’s ‘Play Festival’, and their debut single release due to drop on Decon / Columbia early next year, Arches are set to bring joy to dancefloors worldwide.",

With a background of 70’s and 80’s disco, pop, hip hop and rock music Andy is a fanatic of all things past, turning them into music for the future. His love for the past is reflected in an almost religious use of old analogue gear, but also a general love for vintage stuff. At age 17 Andy discovered electronic music and started DJ’ing.

  "artist_bio": "«Forget James Brown, for me Airwave is the hardest working man in showbusiness. He makes more tunes in a week than most of us manage in a month. And most annoying of all, they’re all good.» – Tony Mc Guinness, Above & Beyond, 2007.Biography\r\n\r\n1977 saw the death of the King, the release of «Off the Wall», and anecdotically the birth of Laurent Veronnez in Brussels, (a few hours after Imogen Heap’s?)\r\n\r\nDoes it mean anything? We don’t know. But nothing back then could explain the relationship that the man would establish with music later on.\r\n\r\nOf course at the age of 8 or 9 anyone feels attracted by music, but some kids just hear a melody on the radio and reproduce it note by note on a toy keyboard. Surprisingly, this happening didn’t ring a bell, and Laurent ended up addicted to ICT, pixels and graphics more than anything else until the age of 14.\r\n\r\nLaurent discovered back then what perfect pitch meant, and developed the gift he received from God, was playing keyboards for hours and making his neighbours mad while homework was left undone. A typical youth for a musician but also an untypical way to enter a new world where art is as important as science.\r\n\r\nHit by surprise by a virus called Electronic Dance music, Laurent developed his knowledge of music and technology in Parallel until his first demos saw the light of day in may of 1995. 1996 saw him release his first tracks on the infamous Bonzai imprint, but that is 1998 that saw him grow up and become the progressive trance artist we know today, with the release of his first Airwave record, I want to Believe, immediately picked up by UK’s own Sasha and Oakenfold, and later on by up and coming youngster Tiësto, gaining popularity as much as he was playing Laurent’s records. The same can be said about the whole dutch trance scene, in which Laurent’s records were and still are omnipresent\r\n\r\nThat is how Laurent developed his DJ and performer’s career from back then, having several gigs worldwide, from Tokyo to San Francisco, from Auckland, NZ to Toronto, and from Manchester to Athens. Hundreds of gigs saw him perform at the world’s biggest clubs of those times, Slinky, Gatecrasher, Godskitchen, The Gallery, 1015, Dopler in Bratislava, and many others, all of them had the chance to welcome Laurent Airwave one day, if not several times, which proves that you don’t need to overcommercialize your music to get rewarded all around the world.\r\n\r\nToday, Laurent doesn’t count productions anymore, as the track counts hit beyond 500 productions (under Airwave and many other aliases, such as The Green Martian, Velvet Girl, Cape Town, Planisphere, Fire & Ice, Yamakasi, Antidote, Lolo, and many others) and well over 100 remixes under his belt. He’s worked with the biggest names in the progressive and trance scene, from Armin van Buuren to John 00 Fleming and Markus Schulz, and remixed the likes of Tiesto, Judge Jules, Josh Gabriel (under his Andain alias), and many, many others. His 2006 triple opus, «Trilogique» was highly regarded by the likes of Paul van Dyk among others. «Touareg» saw him collaborate with musicians coming from opposed sides of the record industry. Gifted people gave this album a unique stamp.\r\n\r\nAnd Tomorrow is another Challenge for Airwave and his troops. By the time you read this, the shift in sound already has started and Fans know how full of surprises the man can be. Forget the big fanfare riffs, it’s time to get mature! To sum it up, Laurent alongside with long time idols of his and day 1 supporters, «is creating a world full of humanity, craving for a better world much more than success and fame, which eventually lead to greed». Imagine a world losing the weight of those useless properties and you vaguely have an idea of how altruistic and important the man is for the EDM scene.",

  "cover_photo": "",
  "artist_bio": "Aeroplane is the Belgium-based project of Vito De Luca.You fly with Aeroplane once, you don’t forget it. In just three years, the Italian-Belgian producer has established himself as party-starting DJ, remixer du jour -with his spacious cosmic-disco re-rerubs of Grace Jones (William’s Blood), Friendly Fires (Paris) and Sebastien Tellier (Kilometer)- and, via his own piano-sprinkled melancholic beauties like Caramellas,leaders of the nu-disco and Balearica scene. So Aeroplane’s debut album, We Can’t Fly, arrives with sky-high hopes. Now that our appetites have been whetted by those brief, tantalising excursions, what delights await us on their maiden long-haul flight?\r\n\r\nPlenty, it turns out. Recorded in Toulouse, Paris, London and Los Angeles, We Can’t Fly (co-produced by Bertrand Burgalat), is a grown up, dazzlingly accomplished record that showcases not just a passion for stately, soulful disco and early 80s electronica, but a lush and bittersweet set of influences that stretch from Abba and film soundtracks to Floyd, the Stones and the Italian crooners that Vito Deluca’s mama played him in his Brussels youth.\r\n\r\nAeroplane is a one-man operation. Flying solo has given Vito the chance to flex his classically trained musical muscles: “Aeroplane has been put in the dance music category but I’m a songwriter, that’s what I know how to do. I wanted to go back to proper pop music, not being forced to do nine-minute tracks so the DJ can mix in before and after.” Aeroplane has never been at the mercy of traditional bpms, and being free of “the dancefloor pressure” has given Vito additional license to slow things down and look around. “I’m at my best at 105bpm,” he says. “That’s the speed where I make the best music. You can do more, there’s more groove, more feeling.”\r\n\r\nHe’s not kidding. Take We Can’t Fly, the languid, show stopping anthem-to-be with which Aeroplane kicked off their landmark 500th Radio 1 Essential Mix at Circus in Liverpool earlier this year. Laying gospel harmonies over Compass Point-era Grace Jones reggae, blissed-out Rimini keyboards and kiddie vocal samples, it’s handsome proof that dancability and musicality don’t have to be mutully exclusive. It’s going to sound rapturous live, when Vito and an expanded on-stage line-up play Aeroplane’s first dates later this year.\r\n\r\nBeing let loose in a proper, bells-and-whistles studio for the first time has been something of an eye-opener. “I’ve been recording in my bedroom for my entire life so it sounds a million times better,” says Vito. “I was totally like a kid in a sweetshop.” The results are spectacular - and at times intensely cinematic. The widescreen, string-splashed Mountains of Moscow is the soundtrack to the best Eighties blockbuster you’ve never seen, while London Bridge and Point of No Return are mini-epics of spiralling Floydian guitar riffs and plaintive Tangerine Dream synths. “That's my dream actually, writing scores for movies,” says Vito. “For me the Rocky soundtrack is at the same level as Dark Side of the Moon, it’s the same kind of perfection.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother mighty inspiration was Giorgio Moroder, whose gleaming electronic scores for Scarface and Midnight Express fed into the vintage disco stylings of My Enemy and the propulsive, piano-led Superstar, which Vito describes as “Moroder meets Canned Heat”.\r\n\r\nThe raucous, razor-blade rock of I Don’t Feel features the formidable vocals of Merry Clayton, who backed Jagger on Vito’s favourite Stones song, Gimme Shelter. ”There was always this black chick singing at the end and I never knew who she was. I also had this amazing soul-funk record by a girl called Merry Clayton. Then one day they played Gimme Shelter on the radio and the DJ explained that it was Merry singing. I lost the plot and said we have to try everything we can to get her.” Get her they did, and Clayton wraps her arena-sized lungs around squalling Bowie-ish riffs to impressive effect. “She killed the song, it was amazing.”\r\n\r\nThe roster of guest singers is impeccable. Nicolas Ker, the frontman of French italo-disco outfit Poni Hoax, adds a sullen elan to Fish in the Sky, an electro torch song worthy of Human League, while dream-pop outfit Au Revoir Simone breathe delicate harmonies over the woozy ballad We Fall Over, and London’s Jonathan Jeremiah transforms Good Riddance into a low-slung slice of honky-tonk soul.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most ear-catching turn comes from the precocious LA teen-vixen Sky Ferreira on Without Lies, a cover of a song by the Belgian screen star Marie Gillain. The 17 year-old Ferreira takes obvious relish in delivering suggestive lines like “When I eat cake I prefer the cherry”. Vito picked her because “we needed a young voice but kind of sexy too. It’s like an angel and a demon in the same body.”\r\n\r\nIt’s a breathtakingly diverse collection of songs, but what runs through all of them is that wistful Aeroplane trademark, what Vito calls “sad happiness”. It’s something he learned from the Italian pop maestros so beloved of his mum, men like Lucio Battisti and Adriano Celentano. An exquisite, bittersweet state that’s neither overly dark nor simplistically happy. It’s the Aeroplane way - wake up and smell the kerosene.",

The natural structures reveal an organic & atmospheric meditative drive to take you further. Hypnotic, stripped and quite abstract.ASR (°1977, Belgium) started his love for music at the early age of 4. Discovering little by little what frequencies could do with the body-mind symbiosis, he evolved to become a synth- and bassplayer in several blues, funk & psycho rock projects. Influenced by the great vibes from the Delta, from the African woods, the cities of Rajasthan & the seatowns of Bali. The cadanz has still the same mother.\r\nASR is a solo-project where no compromises are made. Free & impulsive, pure & direct.\r\nAs a live act, ASR drives it even deeper, based on his resolute relation with the multiverse. Ready for every moment on the floor, ASR enjoys the true fact of action/interaction with the audience. Everything is energy. Everything is vibration. Everything resonates. So it does everywhere & always.\r\nASR brings the sound LIVE or as a DJ SET. Anyhow, the music of ASR shifts your state of mind. The minimal sound consists of sober harmonics & deep grooves.

This is ASR's 3th release on Simplex Records. The original mix is one for the stronger bodies and minds, full of energy & power, balancing between dark crazy techno and solid minimal. The syncopated percussion is pivoting on the Berghain based groovy sound. The melody is sparse and therefore a natural step in ASR's evolution as a recording artist. The structure of this track embraces well placed developments and sonic changes.\r\nThe sound of all tracks is coherent and vigorous hypnotic. ASR hired Minus artist JPLS for a remix on the A-side. Result is a typical JPLS sound. Abstract & subtracted. ASR's friends, rising Smallroom artist Mike Wall gives a dark dreamy mysterious point of view and Japan's tech & minimal talent Shin Matsura hits you straight in the face just like the original mix does. These two producers are the personnel on the B-side.\r\nwww.asrofficial.com\r\nvideoteaser: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul4RnTIJ8mE\r\nmaking of video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6SCaMZXSkA&feature=related\r\n",

Brehme is a DJ and producer who is born and raised in Brussels. An audiophile with a worrying obsession about music who gradually developed a definite personal approach with a firm focus on deep atmospheres and hypnotic vibes enveloping the last twenty years of musical history. \r\n\r\nSince the age of twenty he's a regular guest at one of Europe's most renowned techno clubs Fuse in Brussels, generally as a support dj for Ostgut Ton or Drumcode label nights. The rest of Belgium soon followed: in growing numbers he performed at intimate venues all over the country and abroad, and large events such as I Love Techno, Doomsday Festival, and City Parade. Brehme made his first release on Coincidence Records in 2014\r\n\r\nAs a resident dj at the booming Sunday afternoon concept Technoon in Brussels and the infamous Hertz nights in Antwerp, he proves that he excels in constructing both short, profound and lengthy intensifying sets wether it’s as a warm-up act, during peak time slots or throughout late morning closing sessions.",

After 4 years of college and many many electro/techno/house parties, his music career dragged him all over Europe. And since then Aydin is a travelling international DJ; his electro, techno and house mixsets are flowing from Lisbon to London; London to Athene, Athene to Ukraine, Ukraine to Cyprus...\r\n\r\nAydin has released his first single 'Out of scope'  in the beginning of 2007, this album gained much respect from the music community and stayed at top 100 list of beatport for 5 weeks. Aydin is now in the process of completing his second EP 'Fresh or Stale', which contains Electro/Electronic/Techno/Minimal and house tunes, one of major UK label has shown interest to release this single, more to come soon.  Aydin has recently remixed one of Carl Cox track 'I want you', the techno, house, electro and minimal remix of this track will be released under the grand  UK label CR2.\r\n\r\nAydin is now teaming up with several belgian DJ's to produce electro, electronic and some techno tracks, the unions are soon to be announced.\r\n\r\nRelentless urge to entertain the crowd, his screaming harmonic mixes are clear indications for a promising future for this talent.",

  "artist_bio": "When it comes to dance music, few producers can claim the same authority that Boddhi Satva has. Known affectionately as the founding father of Ancestral Soul, Boddhi’s music has spirituality as the central hallmark and uses the thread of soul music to weave a seamless tapestry of African music styles, set to the pace of house music changing entirely the way the genre is perceived and experienced.Boddhi Satva was born and raised in Central African Republic where his love for music was clear even in his formative years when he was involved in writing,producing and rapping with Gbekpa Crew (hip hop crew), created by himself and a few friends.  His overwhelming desire to share a deeper message in conjunction with irrefutable production skills left him searching for a more meaningful way to get his sound heard.  \r\n  \r\n   In 2000 Boddhi's search for more took him to Belgium to pursue his studies which revealed his greatest passion, music and ultimately deep house music.  After absorbing the music of the greats like Masters At Work, Osunlade and  Kevin Yost, Alton Miller, St Germain, just to name a few Boddhi knew what he wanted to do and described it as follows, “It was like a revelation to me, from then on I decided to play and produce THIS music”, and that's exactly what he has been doing!\r\n   \r\n   Having met Alton Miller in 2005 and working together on two powerful Eps' \"Prelude To A Motion Ep\" and \"See The Day\", released by Paris-based ATAL MUSIC, Boddhi's name and sound was not only gaining recognition but praise from peers all around the world.  Boddhi's motivation was stronger than ever and 2006 brought forth the distinct sound of Ancestral Soul that was first inspired and then introduced to the world by Osunlade's Yoruba Records with the “Satva Varti Ep”.  At this point Boddhi had not only met many of the people that inspired him in the industry but he was now working with them on various remixes and original productions and also with labels like Bubble Soul, Seasons Limited, Seed, Ocha Records, Yoruba Records, Abicah Soul Recs, Franck Roger Digital, Deeper Shades Recs, Citydeep and UGH.  \r\n  \r\n   The impressive body of work and multiple collaborations within such a short period of time earned Boddhi the title \"THE MACHINE\" from his peers and also fueled the drive that had been building within him to start his own label \"Offering Recordings\".  Offering Recordings was a part of Boddhi's inner spirit and dedicated to quality music that brought forward uplifting feelings.  Spiritually refined, Offering conveys it's message through music; freeing everyone of their stresses, fears, and inner pains.  This label was an outlet for Boddhi to give support and recognition to artists that feel the music but also appreciate the message that lives within the music. \r\n  \r\n   All of Boddhi's hard work and more significant, his true love, understanding and respect for THIS music that he holds close to his soul and keeps intertwined with his spiritual self keeps his sound changing and evolving while sustaining the underlying message and feel of everything that he has always believed in.  Boddhi is a different breed of entertainer, one that creates for the soul and from the heart,  his music exists as a path to free everyone from the wear and tear that this world places on each of us at different points in our lives.  Boddhi is not content with just making you move on the dance floor, through his infections beats and combinations of drums and ancestral sounds he hopes to move you in every way imaginable.\r\n   \r\n  2010 has delivered Boddhi to a higher plain, an elevated state of creativity that has lead to him being signed with Grammy Award Winner Louie Vega's label; Vega Records.  When asked about Boddhi Satva and how he came to be a part of Vega Records Louie had this to share, \"Mr. V brought me an edit of a Boddhi Satva retouch of a BBE Records Artist known as V (not Mr.V).  I liked this calabo of Mr.V & Boddhi so I licensed the track for Vega Records.  Lou Gorbea connected us via phone and after a few conversations with Bodhhi I started to realize just how much music he had accumulated in such a short time and as we started having lengthier conversations and becoming friends I got to hear what he was working on at the time.  I knew right then and there that he was capable of putting together an entire album project and I was very confident that he could deliver.  I loved his sound and he is also a very good DJ that plays with strong presence, he is a well rounded artist, that's what brought him to Vega Records Collective.\"\r\n  \r\n   With the full support of Louie Vega and Vega Records for the past two years Boddhi's exposure has sored to new heights.  Louie has introduced Boddhi to the scenes most prestigious events like WMC in Miami, ADE in Amsterdam, Vega Records Get Togethers in NYC, Sunset Ritual of IBIZA and Londons prized MINISTRY OF SOUND, so they can experience what Louie knew from his first encounters with Boddhi, that his sound would move people!  All of this exposure and hard work has brought countless tracks, mixes & remixes, fans from all over the world and true strength and integrity with consistent hits.  Boddhi is now harnessing all of that energy and preparing to release \"Invocations\"his highly anticipated album which embodies and places all the growth, spiritually and emotionally, that Boddhi has experienced through out his entire journey in this music. \"Invocations\" is an album filled with Eclectic Sounds, African Roots, Neo Soul, Ragga that all has the signature Boddhi style.  With tracks like \"Who Am I\" (feat. Athenai & C.Robert Walker) & \"Puncho Koko\" (feat. Yacoub) you can see and feel Boddhi's range and growth in every facet of his art.  Boddhi's spiritual openness to the universe and all the good it holds has also brought him to Greece, Japan, Germany, Italy, Angola, South Africa and that's just to name a few of the many places in the past year!  When it comes to the United States Boddhi is in high demand and welcomed with opened arms, having rocked NYC's house community he has gone on to also share his light with Chicago, Las Vegas, L.A., Detroit, Phoenix, Boston, Miami, and again that's just in this year!      \r\n   \r\n   As 2011 approaches, Boddhi humbly drops his head and thanks everyone and everything in the known and unknown universe for the support, respect and prolific acceptance of the music that is in essence him.  The new year is filled with growth and even more opportunities for Boddhi in all aspects of his creative journey.  Dates are already being booked for appearances across Europe, Asia, South Africa and in the US, studio time is being penciled in for tracks soon to be written and produced and the passion to keep all of this moving forward beats stronger than every within Boddhi.  This journey is just starting and trust that BODDHI SATVA will be creating well into the approaching new year and all that follow after!",

  "cover_photo": "",
  "artist_bio": "With over 15 years of experience as DJ, Bart Millow is the confirmation of the fact that skills grow over time. Most of his experience was gained in the highlight time of the Belgian club scene, which now has changed into a different kind of night culture, and an evolution to the approaches that have been conventional in the past. Recently Bart Millow has started to produce his own music, which meant that the era of an absolute dj culture has stopped.Bart Millow has started his passion very early on in his youth. When his brother introduced him to the world of DJ'ing and clubbing, something snapped with Bart. He felt that this music, and mixing music to create a new groove, was really it. And so it begun. With only 15 years, this youngster started to buy his very own records. The first record he bought was the now legendary classic  \"The First Rebirth\" of Belgian duo Jones & Stephenson. Starting with such a mile stone only proved that he has the talent to discover the better sounding music. The surname Millow, is a name chosen through the influence of Bart's Brother, who bought a record of DJ Millow for Bart. \r\n\r\nThe introduction to the booming Belgian club scene caused a logical consequence for Bart: his career as a DJ would start in these clubs. The sounds of that time delivered by different clubs, could be defined as the early version of trance till progressive, and today this music is considered to be the predecessor of any other music that defines the club scene nowadays.\r\nWhile developing better skills, Bart Millow made different guest appearances in clubs and afterclubs. Among them are: Illusion, La Rocca, Montini and many others.\r\n\r\nHis influences are various: it can go from Moby till Royksopp, but also Steve Lawler and Gui Boratto count as important sources for his love for music. In this present time, Richie Hawtin and Marco Carola can be held responsible for the evolution from old schoolish club music to tech house and techno. Considering that these 2 styles are the new club music, Bart kept in mind that DJ'ing wouldn't get him any further than he was at the moment. In 2012 he made the step of getting in to the world of producing, working towards the moment that a first own release would be a next mile stone.\r\n\r\nWhen you see him performing, it's quite obvious that Bart Millow is taking you into his world of music. The storytelling, that is attached to seamless mixing of different kind of tracks in house and techno, is a direct effect of his experiences in the club scene. Whether if it's new music of old music, the creation of another groove, with only using the decks and some selected tracks, is something that Bart Millow has mastered as no other. Creating an atmosphere, adapted to the moment of the night is a very short explanation to what Bart does. As time flows, it's only a matter of momentum and time before we discover what Bart Millow has to bring us into another world.",

It is the moment of making, of creating which is the most exciting, rather than performing an existing track or piece as  successfully as possible.\r\n\r\nPrevious appearances at Iceland Airwaves, Beursschouwburg Brussels, Stockholm S in Antwerp, Bazaar Brussels and others.",

An audiophile with a worrying obsession about music who gradually developed a definite personal approach with a firm focus on deep atmospheres and hypnotic vibes enveloping the last twenty years of musical history. \r\n\r\nSince the age of twenty he's a regular guest at one of Europe's most renowned techno clubs Fuse in Brussels.

Brehme made his first release on Coincidence Records in 2014\r\n\r\nAs a resident dj at the booming Sunday afternoon concept Technoon in Brussels and the infamous Hertz nights in Antwerp, he proves that he excels in constructing both short, profound and lengthy intensifying sets wether it’s as a warm-up act, during peak time slots or throughout late morning closing sessions.",

In July 20..Born in 1982, Arcana was interested in music from the early start. At the age of 9, she started expressing herself by means of an acoustic guitar. When growing older however, she got more and more drawn to electronic music. Arcana started going out to clubs and parties but quite quickly discovered she wanted to do more with this music than just party to it. So she moved away from the dance floor and headed for that dj booth.\r\nPlaying her first gig at Boa Connection she slowly started building up references and had a first big break playing at La Rocca’s infamous Backstage on Sunday. In July 2002 Arcana received the rather unusual request to appear on national television in an episode of \"Witte Raven\" (Faking It) where a classical pianist got turned into a dj and then thrown into a dj-contest to test her skills. Some friends convinced Arcana to go for it, and so she did. She won the dj contest, which was judged amongst others, by living legend Derrick May. This resulted in playing at the closing night of Ghent's most famous club: Culture Club. Things escalated a bit, giving her more and more bookings, mostly in Ghent. Early 2004, had the chance to play Audition in Tijuana and was invited for a couple more gigs. A few months later she played a live set on national radio at StuBru's Switch- Discover The Dj-Weekend. When in September 2004 Tijuana started their new season, Arcana was asked to take on a Saturday residency at the club, which she gladly accepted.\r\nIn 2006 Arcana thought that it was time to take the whole nightlife experience to a new level by throwing her own 6am.be-parties one Saturday a month in La Rocca.\r\nJuly 2007 brought a whole new foreign challenge when she was asked to take up a residency at Prestige in Ibiza (ES) during the summer.\r\n\r\nGuest appearances:\r\nCafé d’Anvers (Belgium)\r\nCulture Club (Belgium)\r\nDecadance (Belgium)\r\nFlanders Expo (Belgium)\r\nStereo Sushi (Belgium)\r\nVooruit (Belgium)\r\nMarktrock (Belgium)\r\nVRT (Belgian National Television)\r\nStudio Brussel (Belgian National Radio)\r\nRadio Scorpio (Belgian Regional Radio)\r\nOutsoon FM – FM Brussel (Belgian Regional Radio)\r\nXL- Air (Belgian Regional Radio)\r\nYeti (France)\r\nLeeberty (France)\r\nWaakzaamheid (Holland)\r\n…\r\n\r\nResidencies at:\r\nLa Rocca (Belgium)\r\nTijuana (Belgium)\r\nCirque Central (Belgium)\r\nPrestige (Ibiza, ES)\r\n…",

  "artist_bio": "November rain, dark skies. We present you: Bons&Lawish. Two souls passionate about techno music, producing and playing the most outrageous sounds as much as they can. Always keeping quality high and frequencies low.Bons already started out in 2005 under the pseudonym Lauhum. As a member of the Kingsize Audio concept he kept the underground vibe alive at The Zoo, with the help of Pierre (fuse), Maxim and DjLiquid. Sending in a live set to StuBru delivered him a set on air, at Silo club and at 10daysOff. And of course, Bons knows techno inside-out. His live experience and technical knowledge established at the SAE Institute (Brussels) makes him no stranger to the techno community. And then there’s Lawish, born and raised in the dusty fields of Haspengouw. Being a full blood musician and DJ, he’s been educating himself in music theory and praxis since an early age. He never misses an opportunity to integrate his musical knowledge into techno productions. Analog synths, digital synths, guitars, percussion,…he loves and plays it all. \r\n\r\nBons&Lawish never forget to pursue the new visionaries (think about Beck and Pfirter), while always honoring the grandpa’s (think about Mills and Clarke). Meanwhile they’ve played at Café d’Anvers, Forty Five club, Donker fest, alongside numerous established techno heads; but listing them would be lame. Quality techno productions, percussion driven sets and the love for music is what it's all about. See you soon on the dance floor!",

  "artist_bio": "DJ/Producer based in Ghent, Belgium - bookings: bookings@audiotape.beAudiotape’s musical journey started at the age of 15 back in 2002. His first experiences with club culture were eye-opening. He wanted to share the music that he loves with others. Deejaying should become his craft. \r\n\r\nBack then he played under a different moniker: Karma Electronics. \r\n\r\nIn 2009 he started a monthly residency on the radio show Charged on Urgent.fm that he maintained until 2011. As a result, Seba Lecompte asked him to come and play at Decadance, where he still plays regularly. In 2011 he changed his alias to Audiotape. Later the same year he also became resident at Cafe Theatre and together with his good friend Sugar Cain at the infamous parties in the bar of restaurant Volta. \r\n\r\n2015 proves to be a very important year for Audiotape.

We had partyflights direction Belgium in the late eighties and early neighties.\r\nProducers as Frank DeWulf and Yves De Ruyter were gods in Belgium and far overseas.\r\nFor me the start to embrace electronic music for ever...house music was born and Jack is here to stay.\r\nThroughout the following years I was always inspired by new music genres and subgenres.\r\nAcid turned into detroit techno , a new French house scene kicked in at the late neighties , a complete electroclash revival early 2000.\r\nFurther on everybody made their choice in a huge variety of electronic sounds and scapes.\r\nI always loved house and deephouse music combined with dub and basses.\r\nIf been influenced by the music of Prince , Max Berlin , Motorbass , Stacey Pullen , Groove Armada , Underworld , Pepé Braddock , Jamie Jones , Martin Buttrich and the list goes on and on.\r\nRespect to all artists fans at RA",

  "cover_photo": "",
  "artist_bio": "It was 2004 when he took a dive into the world of producing. Around that time minimal and tech house were ruling the scene regarding the Belgian club scene. Labels like M_nus and Kompakt were the things that party poopers made go crazy, and Benjamin didn’t get enough of just being one of them. Exchanging his place with a spot behind the dj booth would sound like the most logical step, and in this ..It’s only the last decade that techno found its way back to the people. After a silent period of time, with the slow extinct of the old school sound of techno in some countries except for Germany, big and bigger parties would come out on various places. Events that still are ruling the techno scene as it is. Digging deeper into this music, and visiting events that are related to it, jumping over the gap from minimal to techno couldn’t be that hard for Ben Solar.\r\nIf one club in Belgium should be mentioned when you talk about techno, it’s definitely the Fuse in Brussels. It’s in this temple of techno that Ben Solar became acquainted with techno for the first time. While visiting the club on a regular basis, he heard sets of infamous artists that still are around nowadays like Richie Hawtin, Len Faki, Steve Bug, one of the godfathers of techno: Dave Clarke. Tunes like Ganimed by Michael Schwarz and Len Faki’s Stranger To Stability were truly game changing for Ben Solar. Techno would be his new destination, and he knew it.\r\n\r\nWith experience gained as The Nutty Producer in the past, both on DJ’ing and producing, the switch was quickly made. While still being in the phase were lots of things had to be discovered, his first gigs as Ben Solar were becoming a fact. With the performance of a liveset on Whatthefuck Party Open Air in France, and a gig on a party called Quantum, held in Decadance, Ghent, his career in techno definitely had a good start. On the latter, he shared the line up with the dutch lady of techno called Godiva, and the Belgian underground phenomena Twist3d, who happens to be the founder of up and coming label Bunk3r Records. Later on Twist3d had picked up a set of Ben Solar at Open Music Synergy. That set was key to getting Ben Solar into Bunk3r Records. This label was very young on that moment, and because Ben Solar designed his own covers for his releases, which is some sort of an artistic offspring, he became the lead designer of Bunk3r. As this is almost from the beginning, he too became partly responsible for the growth of this label.\r\n\r\nWhile producing mostly techno, the sound that Ben Solar delivers is a tad bit different from other producers you can encounter in this scene. From a talented musician who wants to grow, it’s not very surprising that his influences contain artists that altogether cover the wide spectrum of the world of electronic of music. Artists like Robert Babicz aka Rob Acid, Cinematic Orchestra, Amon Tobin, Len Faki, Richie Hawtin, Modeselektor and many others are just a part of the ones that have a kind of godlike status for Ben Solar because of their innovation or invention of specific styles.\r\n\r\nWhen booking Ben Solar, there are 2 choices. If you book him for a DJ-set, you get straight forward, dark and banging techno, packed in a clever mix. But his live sets obviously are of another dimension: when you book him for a live set, you ask him to tell a story. And that story also is very dark, but because it’s made of only his own work, it’s profound. With this energy, the story will take you somewhere to the point when you get lost in a synergy of different basslines and percussion. When that happens, you know that you’ll never forget Ben Solar and his music. He knows, and in time so will you.",

Discovering a shared love for music and a mutual respect for each other, CP entered the studio with Benoit, the former's musical ideas combining with the latter's production skills to create tracks that could move the dancefloor, whilst being accessible outside of the club environment. Their debut release 'Apollo Vibes' as Pole Folder & CP is testament to this, capturing the imagination of many and the attention of DJ John Digweed who has been a big supporter of the duo's releases, kicking of his Los Angeles Global Underground mix compilation with the track, signing them to a multi single deal on his highly respected label Bedrock. Apollo Vibes was also featured on the original soundtrack of the american movie ‘The Rave'. Their release ‘Dust', also featured on Digweed's MMII mix compilation, was used as a television station Channel 4 trailer tune. \r\n\r\nHaving played at all the famous Belgian clubs such as 'Boccaccio' and ‘La Rocca' or ‘La Bush' and running his own monthly show called \"Expressions\" on Frisky Radio, Cedric has held down residencies, including a six years residency at one of the country's biggest nightclub, ‘The Palladium'. Other notable dj slots were held at ‘Tao After Club', ‘Baramundi' and also with Pole Folder at Factory and in Eindhoven at Clubeclips. \r\nSome notable guest sets where performed at Fuse where he has warmed for John Digweed himself or at Café d’Anvers with Pole Folder for the Sasha Involver Tour. \r\nSome international dj booking where held from Greece, Switzerland, England, Germany, Roumania, Russia and Monaco to Mexico. \r\n\r\nToday he is art director and resident dj of the new monthly concept Pulse Factory Renaissance in one of the most famous club in Belgium called Pulse Factory (http://www.pulse-factory.com). He also created 2 mix cd compilations for the club. \r\n\r\nHis also running a monthly radio show on Frisky Radio (www.friskyradio.com) called Expressions.",

Being a little kid, he was already interested in very melodic tracks and it wasn't a surprise that Robert Miles - Children was a track he always remembered from his childhood. It was a first sign that Config wouldn't be the kid with the usual taste in popular music. No, he was interested in a kind of music that went deeper and moved people.\r\n\r\n \r\nHe grew up in times where Trance was still played on the radio and without any doubt this has affected the way he's still playing his music now. During the last years Config crossed many styles of music. The first style he really got interested in was Progressive Trance and Progressive House, during the period when Sultan, Matthew Dekay, Sasha, and many others had their great days. But as the time went by he slowly moved on to the more energetic kind of melodic music, Trance.\r\n\r\nThe way trancetracks could move him and touch his snares was something he really enjoyed. Great euphoric feelings that caused so many emotions; it were great times to listen to Trance. Therefor, it wasn't a surprise his first dj sets were mostly tranceminded.\r\n\r\nHowever, in 2006 Config was getting a little fed up by the sound in the world of trance.. The tracks lost the touch they had years before, and to him it felt too generic, too artificial. During 2006 his sets were mostly crossover sets from progressive to trance, with progressive slowly taking over.\r\n\r\n \r\nIn 2007 Config decided to leave trance behind and totally focus on Progressive again, his biggest love. From there on he varied from playing House to even Techno, still with 'melody' as the most important aspect in his sets. He also started making mashups with his favourite tracks, which resulted in some support by some of the most famous dj's in the scene, like James Zabiela and DJ Orkidea. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 2011 Config decided to team up with J.E.O.F. and form their new alias 'Guess What?'. The duo stands for great house, fully blended with special Guess What?-edits and mashups, giving every single set they play a unique edge; Party Time garantueed! After only being founded for a short amount of time Guess What? got book for a set in Culture Club, Ghent. The start of a very promising duo has been HUGE! \r\n\r\nBut do not worry, the Config spirit is also still alive and to be found in every Config-set you will hear! \r\n\r\nConfig is currently having 2 monthly radioshows, Crossing Borderlines, where he's playing his most trancy sets, on www.afterhours.fm and Inner Sanctuary, his 2 hour full on progressive show at www.trancesonic.fm. \r\n\r\nIn july 2010 Config started a third show. This time a weekly radioshow on saturday, 18h CET - 19h CET, at Topradio Aalter, 104,7 FM, also called Crossing Borderlines, a bit of a mashup of Inner Sanctuary and Crossing Borderlines on AH.FM in one weekly set.

Spinning and producing house music. bookings: brashbrosmusic@gmail.comThe love for music and playing the songs we love for a crowd has been around for quite a while. We started seperatly back in 2009 playing some local student- and birthday parties. It didn't evolve much until we both stepped it up a notch in 2011 when we started looking into producing and making our own edits.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 2011 it was clear we'd start playing and producing together, just how we where going to name the project wasn't quite clear. After some less then impressive ideas we came up with Brash, a word with quite a lot of meanings, just as our taste in music has a big range.\r\n\r\nWe started in a local pub in Izegem, called Vlaams Huis where we got some attention from both known as unknown people. Among them even some promotors from which we got some new gigs.\r\n\r\nHalfway through July we started our Rejected concept with YRD?!, bringing quality house combined with the more 'commercial' house you'd get on a Tomorrowland mainstage. We now intent of improving this concept and bringing it towards a town near you!\r\n\r\nThere's no bad music, just people who don't like it!",

Armed with a second-hand mixer, a tape deck and two old cd-players he took charge of the music and he immediately lost his heart to the 4/4 beat. \r\n\r\nAs the years passed, Cashmere searched for his own musical identity and started to develop his own and unique style of music. This ‘identity’ got him noticed by some very influential people in the club scene and in no time he was playing in both small and big clubs all over the country. But Belgium wasn’t enough. He aimed for international fame with some great gigs in The Netherlands, France, Germany, Spain, Ibiza, Thailand and even Tokyo Japan. Over the years he rocked not only clubs, but also large parties and festivals with his infamous dance floor attacks! \r\n\r\nHowever, playing other people’s tracks wasn’t enough for Cashmere. With his keen sense of music it didn’t take long before he started to produce his own songs as well. At first this was just for fun, but as we all now practice makes perfect and after years of intensive studio time, his productions began to sound better and better. Cashmere decided it was time to take things to the next level and invested in his own studio. This was a logical but very crucial step in his career as a dj/producer. As his productions became more professional, more and more people picked up his tracks and the first record deal with Steve Lawler’s Viva Music was soon to be made. \r\n\r\nNowadays you can find Cashmere playing in his home country and far beyond. When he’s not busy touring, you’ll probably find him in his studio, working on new tracks and remixes, and trying to innovate his music and improve his techniques even more. \r\n",

Cast-iron DJ credentials alongside a portfolio of production skills have seen the German native perform across northern Europe and beyond to Ibiza, Asia and the USA, while producing a raft of ori..Cihan Mareno is a product of modern multi-cultural Europe. Born in Germany, raised in the Netherlands and now resident in adjoining Belgium; a self proclaimed ‘world citizen’, Mareno’s Turkish roots further account for a distinctive blend of flavours so evident in his DJ and production work that has seen him push the boundaries of his chosen craft.\r\n\r\nOvercoming parental concern, it was not long before Cihan’s passion for the music he saw on Dutch television and radio, transformed into a will to succeed in a career littered with an unusually large number of pitfalls. An exceptional ear for musical tonality ensured that the small steps of warm up DJ slots for friends in local Dutch clubs, soon developed into giant strides as Mareno’s technique and skills rose to a point where he began to hold his audiences captivated. A jarring move to Belgium in the late 1990s, aged 17, only served to strengthen his conviction as his maturing tastes saw a move toward the tech house arena. A residency in his adopted Belgian homeland at club “Focus” followed, and a rapidly expanding set of DJ credentials saw gigs in Poland, Turkey, Asia and across mainland Europe, from Poland to the UK. Among the plethora of clubs to provide a platform for Mareno’s performing talents, “Cafe Anvers”, “Peppermill” and “La Rocca” have featured, with further global appearances in Ibiza and the USA cementing a growing reputation. Since the turn of the decade, a production career, simultaneously blossoming adjacent to a demanding DJ schedule, has further seen Cihan Mareno locked in a studio producing and remixing a catalogue of other artists with significant success.\r\n\r\nNow fully integrated into the underground dance movement, techno, tech and deep house are the vehicles that drive the Cihan Mareno sound. Over half a century of Beatport production credits currently sit proudly next to his name, and, since the “Secret Sultan” EP first hit Sezer Uysal’s Dark Pleasure imprint in 2010, Kaapro Rec, Soulman Music and Tulipe Records have all captured Mareno’s pristine rhythms and deep grooves, supported by such luminaries as Richie Hawtin, Marco Carola, and many more\r\n\r\n2014’s opening months have shown no let-up in the growing portfolio of skills with the launch of a new record label and clothing brand under the “Ella Unique” banner effortlessly combining the inextricably linked components of music and fashion with Cihan Mareno’s own “sense and style”. With ambition to produce digital and vinyl releases and the creation of a “lifestyle brand” through the Ella Unique name, Mareno’s infectious optimism is based upon the simple premise that, in spite of the economic realities of the modern twenty-first century, inner beliefs are paramount and, “when things are carried out from the heart, they have a habit of working out.” A simple maxim provides a simple set of core beliefs: money is important but not to the detriment of “soul, inspiration and personal relationships”.\r\n\r\nA growing roster of talent, a burgeoning fashion brand and a passion for music that has seen an enviable collection of skills forged in the competitive arenas of live appearance and production work. The future is certainly exciting for Cihan Mareno as his star continues to shine brightly in the underground dance music firmament.\r\n\r\n.........................................................................................................\r\n\r\nRA DJ Page /     http://bit.ly/1iW26Mk\r\nWebsite /\t        http://bit.ly/1blMz0M\r\nTwitter /\t        http://bit.ly/1fJwA0D\r\nSoundcloud /\thttp://bit.ly/1dotXwR\r\nDiscogs /\t        http://bit.ly/1ff1Bwd\r\nFacebook /\thttp://on.fb.me/1chSrYz\r\nBeatport /         http://btprt.dj/1k6uBHQ\r\n\r\n.........................................................................................................",

He started experimenting with a 2 track recorder, recording all sorts of sounds (drills and diggers:-). He started combining these sounds with his first drum machine (as many as 4 sounds available!). He also bought his first guitar and a drumkit and got into speed metal. He joined the group H-Berion who played French Rock (à la Bérurier Noir) with 2 guitarist, one singer and a drummachine!The least you can say is that the young Danny Casseau could draw from a wide range of musical styles...\r\n\r\nDuring the period 19..Started with music in ’84.\r\n\r\nJoined the group H-Berion who played French Rock (à la Bérurier Noir) with 2 guitarist, one singer and a drum machine.\r\n\r\nExperimented with limited set-up (cheap drum machines, 1-second sampler, 2-track recorder, ...)\r\n\r\nReleased my first e.p. in 1993, Slam Trax – Blow acid, an instant classic.\r\n\r\nJoined Big Time International in 1994 and became one of their hardest working artists, released a whole string of projects on Reload (Trax-X, Atom-X) as well as on Nitric and 21st Century.

  "artist_bio": "Resident @ Wild Family, Feestgedruis, DecadanceThe non-bio of DeeJames.\r\n\r\n Let’s be clear. This is not a dj-bio. A dj-bio “goes a lil’ sumtin’ like this”: fabulous dj X was born in year X, grew up listening to old records from oldschool artist X and started screwing around with his first Technics SL 1200’s at the age of X. Starting out as a living room-dj, fabulous dj X continued on to being a resident of the infamous home-based X-parties, ending up as a headliner in the superduper X-club… . Bla and bla. This is not a dj-bio of that kind, and that’s a promise. This is a life-story. A life-story, skipping the irrelevant stages of Deejames’ life and starting at the essentials. Here goes. \r\n\r\nChapter 1: The Dance-floor. Come on now, you’ve seen him around right? If you haven’t you’re as blind as a bat. Even before ever having touched a record and before going from “James” to “DeeJames” , his legendary appearances in Belgian nightlife have set many dance-floors on fire. It’s a dirty job, but someone’s got to get your party started, and it is likely that James once did, whether it’s by dancing on a bar (and most likely getting kicked off… to then climb up again), jumping on a dj-booth with a record-sleeve on his bald head, or just forcing you to dance by pushing you onto the floor holding your arms up in the air and waving them around for you. This life-story begins where “James” was born: on a dance-floor, and that’s probably where you met him for the first time. \r\n\r\nChapter 2: Adding a Dee. Going off in quest of new ways to bring life to the Belgian club-scene, James coincidentally decided to try and fill another vacancy the electronic music scenery has to offer besides lighting up dance-floors: dj’ing. After a long, profound, and in-depth search for an artist name, he came up with adding a well-considered “Dee” to his name and he started appearing as such on flyers of Ghent-based parties. Guess what, things just magically seemed to work out great for him, people seemed to dig DeeJames as much as they had always digged James. Over the last decade he has continuously been reinventing himself, both on the dance-floor and musically behind decks. \r\n\r\nChapter 3: Residencies, friends and family. Through these reinventions, there has always been 1 consistency in DeeJames’ rollercoaster of a life: his unconditional dedication to his party-peers who overtime became his family. It has always been a story of give and take: his enthusiasm and sincerity about his lifestyle and passion have earned him residencies, friendships and partnerships with Belgium’s finest. He is now a resident at club Decadance, Ghent and at the FEESTGEDRUIS, PUSH-IT and WILD FAMILY label parties organized all-over Belgium and even abroad, he plays at Café d’Anvers on a regular basis, he helped putting the now shut-down Make-Up Club in Ghent on the map, ànd he is a much sought-after guest dj at…basically just any party and club on Belgian soil. Partnerships-slash-profound friendships with dj Prinz, Igor Vincente and Sugar Cain helped shape his success and have taken him as far as starring on the infamous Kazantip-festival in the Ukraine. \r\n\r\nFinal chapter: Yeah but what about his style? As promised, this was not a dj-bio so the story will not end with cliché-BS about inspirations, influences and musical styles. It should be clear from the previous chapters in this book of life that there’s just no pigeon-holing DeeJames in one single category. He deservedly hates the question, and his standard-answer is: I’m influenced by all. There you have it, simple and clear. If we must label him, let’s just say he’s a house dj, because that’s the widest, all-embracing label there is to offer. He brings house music with his own twist, or as he puts it: “I’m making circles out of squares, if that makes any sense at all”. \r\n\r\nNot The End….\r\n",

A few years later he bought his first guitar and \r\nit didn't take long before he replaced it for an electric one. \r\nUnfortunately, at that time, his musical interest drasticly changed \r\nfrom rock music to electronic music. \r\nHe started going out to local techno parties and he got caught by the techno scene.\r\n\r\nWhen the interest in music became an obsession, he decided to buy his own pair of decks. \r\nHe started DJ'ing as Kronoz on local friends parties. \r\nAt the age of 17 he started producing his first tracks with Reason. \r\nHis musical obsession evolved exponentionally when discovering Ableton Live. \r\nUntil now, he still uses Ableton Live as his main DAW.\r\n\r\nHis style could best be described as experimental minimalistic \r\ntechno music with ofcourse, lots and lots of influences from other music genres. \r\n\r\nHis first EP will be released on the 30th of november on Purple Edge Records!\r\nMore info soon!",

One example is globetrotting Belgian house jock Dave Goethals.\r\n\r\nHaving been surrounded by music from an early age, it's only been since the beginning of '09 that Dave has embarked upon his journey as an artist in the Electronic Dance Music scene.\r\n\r\nA journey which has led him to sets in the world famous Ministry of Sound in London for the Gallery and also secured his residency for the Friday Vibes Concept in Budapest. Also, a regular guest at events in neighbouring countries, Dave's name is steadily being picked up by punters across the continent.\r\n\r\nDave's sets work around the basis of House music without ever sacrificing the groove but are also equally marked by versatility, venturing towards the techier and sometimes progressive side of the spectrum. Key word is 'energy'. 'I aim to energise a dancefloor and I'm always on the lookout for tracks that contain that special energetic vibe' says Dave.\r\n\r\nThat search has inevitably led Dave down the production route as well. Constantly looking at creating new sounds to spice up his own sets either under his own name or under his 'Leven T' alias for his darker, techier sound. Several labels in the scene have been positive about Dave's material and his debut EP was released last June through Takos Records. Recently signed to New York's System Recordings and with a steady flow of tracks and remixes in the pipeline its full steam ahead on the production front.\r\n\r\nThings are looking up for Dave and he is bound to continue making a name for himself and bring his sound to as many places as possible. Watch this space for updates on upcoming gigs and future releases.\r\n\r\nFor more info, promos, remix requests and booking:\r\nFirar Promotions\r\n0036 705 315 575\r\n0036 205 220 745\r\nfirarbooking@gmail.com",

Already at the age of 14 instead of buying toys with his birthday money he was saving to buy his first pair of decks. At this young age he already became a dominant presence in parties.\r\n\r\nHis curiosity began to draw him further into the musical world, which held no boundaries for him. Having his own record shop ‘Yellow Cab’ was the next obvious step and by doing this his musical diversity grew and he began to appreciate lots of different styles in dance music.\r\n\r\nIt didn’t take long before two party concepts were born. Together with DJ Tecnum ‘Playground’ was launched. Belgian guests were invited like Redhead, Massimo Girardi & Ramon Tapia. The location was a unique underground bunker instantly providing the right vibes for the party peeps.\r\nThe second concept ‘Bumper’ together with Tone and 4etski invited famous Belgian DJ’s and international guests like John Larner and Slater Hogan.\r\n\r\nWhen he got hit by a truck, this CRACK drove him to the production side of music. Dedicated, driven and focused ‘Crunch Tech’ was born, music that takes you on an emotional journey through desserts, jungles, even out of space; enabling you to discover a world you can only imagine. His inspirations are drawn from his experiences and thus ‘Crack and Crunch’ will continue to spread its music all over the globe.\r\n",

Born in 1952 in a family of diamondtraders he grew up in the diamondlbusiness, so it’s easy to understand why at the age of 16, Louke was already a diamond broker. In 1988 he got tired of the business, so he decided it was time for a new challenge in his life by opening an American bar / restaurant named ‘Luka’s Fine Food and Drinks’ in Antwerp. This loungebar avant la lettre was doomed to close, situated in the diamond centre of Antwerp, during day very crowded but deserted at night… So that’s why Louke went back after 5 years to his first love, raw diamonds. Louke always stayed single, and although he was having some short term relationships, he stayed very wanted by mostly younger women. Lots of them crossed his path, but nevertheless he never got married, a specific choice he made and still respects. In September ’77 Louke discovered Studio54 and it was love at first sight. Studio opened doors in May and Louke had to visit the Club as soon as possible. However there was no alcohol served, taboes were out of the question in this epicentre of music, style and decadence. Studio was the start of the clubculture all over the world, and although a very strict doorpolicy, Louke managed to get in with a friend of his who was a regular. After a couple of times the doorman recognised him, and even if there was a queu of 500 waiting partypeople outside, he always picked Louke out and welcomed him home. He Partied with all the acteurs, singers and other vip’s that were visiting the Club at that time.. Mick Jagger, Jerry Hall, Liza Minnelli, Olivia Newton John, Madonna., Andy Warhol, Diana Ross... Louke met them all and partied together with them in the hottest spot to go out ever: Studio54. At the same time, the first afterparties were submerging, and Louke was a regular visitor of all of them… when staying in NY. He frequently spent weekends over there with friends, just to go out, because there was no clubscene in Europe. Obsessed as he got by the Disco-lifestyle, he never went out with an eager to meet or conquer women, he just went out to party and have fun. When House music finally reached Europe, Louke visited all the great clubs overhere and never ever he was denied entrance. Les Bains Douches in Paris, Papagayo in St. Tropez, Jimmy’s in Monaco, Kings Club in St. Moritz, Embassy in Londen or the Gaultier parties in Amsterdam are just a few of the long list of exclusive clubs were Louke was a regular guest. Over the years he became very close with some of the worlds greatest dj’s and promoters, such as Erick Morillo, Todd Terry or Charles Schillings. Louke has always been a no 1 fan of pure Disco music. This style however faded away and in the early eighties there was a variety of new, electronical musicstyles like New Beat or New Wave, but Louke never found these sufficient enough to fulfill his partyneeds. Finally, in the late eighties a new musical style was created in underground clubs in The States in wich he could totally find a sucessor for his favorite music: housemusic was born. In ’92 Louke went to Israel together with Remy and Belgian’s housegodfather Koenie for a kind of Disneyland –party on the beach, but people over there (or was it the religion?) weren’t really ready for this new kind of electronical music. In London however, crowds were going wild in clubs such as Ministry of Sound, so Louke became a regular visitor in Londons finest clubs. But why travel so far when your home country is one of the leading countries in meanings of House culture? Café d’Anvers, still the leading pure Houseclub in Belgium, created an incredible discoglamour atmosphere with their ‘Paradise’-parties in the early nineties. If there was a club with Studio’s equal – everything goes, the crazier the better – attitude in Belgium, it had to be Café d’Anvers. Other clubs like Mirano or Who’s Who’s Land in Brussels were also often visited by Louke and his friends. Since 1995 Louke goes to Ibiza every year for the closure of clubs at the end of september. He says:” Moslims go to Mekka, Jews go to Jerusalem, Catholics to Rome, and I go to Ibiza on a pelgrimage; Iin 2000 he also went to Miami for the Winter Music Conference with world’s best dj’s, producers and promotors, just to stay in touch with the evolution of House music; A conference that he will be attending also this year. Louke likes small clubs as much as big raves and is never to tired to travel just to have a party. One night when he was sitting at home with his girlfriend, Erick Morillo called him to say he was playing at Ministry of Sound in London that night. Louke jumped in his car, drove to the Channel and took the last boat. He partied there till 7 in the morning, took the first boat back and was back in Antwerp around noon. He often has youngster coming up to him at clubs telling him they want their dad to look and be like him! Besides music his second passion are tv quiz-shows. He already appeared on “Going for Gold” on BBC where he reached the Finals; In Belgium he appeared on “Waagstuk” en “Blokken”. After organizing the infamous Black & White parties and the Club Superb and BeNe Deluxe parties he spread now his Happy House sound all over the world with passion and dedication. Some of his Favorite quotes : NOBODY FUCKS AROUND WITH ME, UNLESS SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR! HAVE NO FEAR, LOUKE IS HERE! LOUKE IS THE NAME WILD PARTY IS THE GAME! I DON’T GET MAD, I GET EVEN! THERE’S TWO KINDS OF CLASS: FIRST CLASS AND NO CLASS! IF THIS IS HELL, I DON’T WANNA BE IN HEAVEN! NO ROMANCE WITHOUT FINANCE! GOD FORGIVES, I DON’T! IF YOU CAN’T STAND THE HEAT, STAY OUT OF THE KITCHEN! SELF SEX IS SAFE SEX WITHOUT HEADACHES !!! IF I WAS GOD I WOULD DO A BETTER JOB !!!",

  "artist_bio": "dj producer and remixerGonna keep this short, who wants to read a 3 paper bio anyway ;)  \r\n\r\nD'Stephanie started dj'ing at a the young age of 16 at a local radiostation and around the age of 18 she became one of Belgium's most wanted dj's  \r\n\r\nBesides one off parties she had several residencies at innovating concepts and clubs in Belgium like Cafe D'Anvers , Fill Collins Club (by I love techno legend Peter Decuypere), Club Geluk , excursions in dance (by 10 days off promotors 5 voor 12) and many more… She also frequented most big festivals in Belgium and travelled around Europe (mostly Holland, Italy, London, France and Spain) Africa and New York.  \r\n\r\nAround 2000 Stephanie released her first music production on a Belgian label and soon after, she made it to the bigger labels abroad such as Sonar Kollektiv ( GER, Jazzanova's label) Jalapeno records (UK) , Chez (USA), Realbasic (Ger) , Broadcite (UK)… and featured tracks on several compilations worldwide (MN2S, Hed Kandi, Switch, PUMA…)  \r\n\r\nIn her homecountry she received massive airplay on the National radio with \"Rock the disco\" \"Future Warrior\" and \"Rum n bass\" ,  while these and most other releases were frequently charted at underground radiostations all over the globe. You can't pigeonhole her to one style, which is her strength but has been the weakness as well to bigger success, Stephanie likes to keep an open mind and follow the passion instead of trends and sometimes a trend too early for the Belgian audience (She was one of the first dj's to promote and spin jungle in Belgium and moved on to newer things before the drum n bass hype ) \r\n\r\nThese days as dj and producer D'Stephanie spins mostly deeper underground housecuts next to newer dubstep influenced housecuts and broken beats,  old skool house and slower disco-ish tracks like the revenge in clubs, more laid-back grooves, nu soul and deephouse in bars, while under the alter ego D'Steph, she's going for a blend of Grime, Booty, nu house, breaks and Uk garage \r\n\r\nRock the spot  \r\n\r\nKissinger - Mood-lounge (Karlsruhe Germany) - The Medicine (London) - AKA (the End London) - Coalesce at Corsica studios (London) - Lopsided at Ruby Lo (London) - Babushka (London) - Gramophone (London) -  Unknown fm (London) - La maison (Rome) - Akab (Rome) - Brumana (Latina) - Ex ess (Naples) - Shaggadelic (Amsterdam film studio's) - club Japan (Barcelona) - club Heffner (Barcelona) - Bar Benidorm (Barcelona) - What's up (Paris) - MILK - Club geluk - Cafe d'Anvers - Fuse - Chemistry (Amsterdam) - Who's Who's Land - Mirano - Silo - De Effenaar (Eindhoven) - Coalesce (London) - Ten days off - I love Techno - Pukkelpop - Hof ter lo - Pacific - Vooruit - Kozzmozz - l'Aeroneffe ( Lille) - Spybar (The Gambia) - Nightlife (Maastricht) - Now 'n Wow (Rotterdam) - Heineken dance parade (Rotterdam) - Never say never - Stalker (Haarlem) - Cafe Capital - Kissinger - Girlesque - Zappa - Culture Club - Tijuana - Couleur Café - Cactus club - H20 - Kaaiman - Leuven Expo - Rumba - HouseTorhout - Lokerse Feesten - Laundry day - Pure - Alterego (Nu jazz festival) - Le tavernier - Cybertheatre - Fill Collins club - Le sud - Virgin Megastore opening - Raf Simons fashionparty - G shock - O42 (NL) - Youthopia - Funky City - L'emotion - Bankwok - Stuurboord - Bardot - Café au lait - Antwerp is Burning - from disco to Disco - Decadance - Yellow Fever - Mobilotopia - Stereo sushi - Natural - Paradox - Bar Midi - het kanaal (Axel Vervoordt)...",

He already played at small school parties. Back then he still played under his first guise Dj Energy, which changed in 2001 to Dj Fire. He got his first big bookings and productions through his job, which was working for the well-known Lightning/Bonzai Records in Antwerp.\r\n\r\nHis dj-career started professionally when he started dj-ing together with dj Ghost at one of the first big house-radiostations called Rave FM. From there on it went to the first resident-clubs Qu and The Hole. Meanwhile Fire also got asked to do guest-performances in clubs such as Extreme, La Scala and Dixies. A few years later Fire had played in nearly every Belgian club (Cherrymoon, Illusion, Zillion, BBC,...) as a guest-dj. Residentclubs included Bel-Air, Club X Belgium, Fauna, Pampas, The Return, Club X in Tilburg, Holland and Afterclub Rockefeller. He also played in a lot of other clubs in Holland like Time and Trance-Buddha in Amsterdam, Ministry of Dance/Outland in Rotterdam and Mysteryland in 1999. His career also took him abroad to bookings in Malta, Finland, Germany, Switzerland, Scotland, Luxemburg and Norway. He played at the legendary Dorian Grey in Frankfurt, EFX-Club in Hamburg, the Love Parade in Berlin and the Summer Parade in Oslo. Also some big raves like Euphoria Rave in Hannover and Highway in Geneva. In 2003/2004 he was also booked for gigs in Oxa Club in Zurich, Switzerland and Club Déja Vu in Holland. In 2006 he played in the Arctic Circle and near the Russian border on 2 gigs in Finland and in Maltas leading club Tattingers. In 2007 he played in Belgian clubs like La Rocca, Factory, Cherrymoon and also at the massive ID&T event Tomorrowland. 2008 saw him playing at events like Tomorrowland 2008, clubs like Illusion, Cherrymoon, Chedis, Visage, Dimanche,... In 2009 he played in Illusion, La Rocca, Cherrymoon and the new Extreme club.\r\nBecoming a father in 2010 has slightly influenced his dj-appearances, with bookings in Zalinaz, Holland, Cherrymoon and some online dj-sets.\r\n\r\nProduction started in 1997, when he teamed up with Dimitri Dewever (Swirl People) to start his first project called Energy Source. This immediately resulted in chartpositions all over the world and plays by dj's like Tiesto. But the big breakthrough came in 1998 when he formed Fire & Ice together with Laurent Veronnez (who is well-known for his project Airwave). Every production was compiled on many national and international compilations (Serious Beats, Club System, Gatecrasher and compilations by Tiesto, Ferry Corsten,...). Fire also worked together with M.I.K.E. (Push) on the project Intimo and with Pascal Quatretemps for Freebase. Fire & Ice have worked as remixers for various big artists as well : productions include remixes for Sunscreem, Forcefield, Freebase, Dj Looneytune, Aurora, Sensoria-X, Sonic Inc., R.O.O.S., Dance Nation, Edvika, Kansai and Unknown Source. One of their latest productions \"Tour De Trance\", which was elected as Tune of the week in the no 1 dj Armin Van Buuren's radioshow A State of Trance! The latest Fire & Ice called “Sayonara” is still available!\r\n\r\nDj Fire also has his own productions and they have all received great reactions by nearly every big dj. Ulan Bator as well as Jetlag were in playlists from Tiesto, Armin, Ferry Corsten, Graham Gold,... \"Religion\" ,\"Summermorning\" as well as \"The Closest Thing To Heaven\" were big favourites of Ferry Corsten and were compiled on cd's like Mixmag, Euphoria,... The last one even made it to TUNE OF THE WEEK on Armin's radioshow A State Of Trance and got played by Paul Van Dyk. \"Let The Joy Rise/Midnight In Beijing\" and \"Trashy/Rendez Vous\" did very good as well... There's also the Dj Fire remix of the Manuel Le Saux track \"Forgive\", which was released in 2007. A full online-album by Dj Fire has also been released in 2007, including all the hits and some new exclusive stuff; there's also a Dj Fire-mix available through the main downloadportals. The next Dj Fire was called \"Transatlantic\", released in January 2009, including an Antidote remix. The track was hammered by Paul Van Dyk, Manuel Le Saux, Dj Elof and some other big names! The follow up on this one is out now and is called “Under Pressure”, including a Sovve remix. Already some great reactions! Don't forget to check out my remixes for \"On The Dancefloor\" by Laurent Wéry, my remix for Yves Deruyter's classic \"Infinity\" and also out now my remix for Tiesto's classics \"The Tube\"! Coming in September 2010 the Dj Fire rmx for Airwave's classic \"Above The Sky\".\r\n\r\nNowadays you can catch Dj Fire on several parties and events throughout Europe, just check his site, his Facebook fanpage and his My Space-account regularly for more updates. And there is more to come!\r\n",

Then one day I stumbled upon the old record collection of my dad. It was all tucked away in the basement. So I started to check out all the old records and started to expand my musical taste and embraced genres like blues, jazz, trip-hop and techno. But the longer I focused on electronic music, the harder it was to resist. So I started spinning some records at a friend’s house.\r\n\r\nThe turntables worked like a drug. I became addicted. By the summer of 2008 I had enough money saved to buy my own equipment. But I had no idea of what style I was getting into or what genre to play.\r\n\r\nSo I started digging in the history of electronic music. After learning the history and foundation of Techno music, I could relate to the Detroit style. Seeing the hip-hop cuts and elements reflecting in the Detroit techno and everything else that was possible with the music, my mind was made up!\r\n\r\nAnd on that note, we will end with a quote:\r\n\r\n“I am nothing in comparison to the music” – Mike Banks",

Ricardo established himself as an acclaimed DJ with his notorious birthday bashes hosting international DJ’s, organizing sold out disco and house parties, appearing on international radio shows, securing local residencies, and frequent gigs from Miami to Amsterdam, Ibiza, and Chicago. He effortlessly sends his audiences into orbit with a blend of jacking Chicago house, deep house, edits, disco, bootlegs and even some lounge and future jazz.  As a producer, he has collaborated on his releases with Nicolas Kenyon as “Kenyon & Ricardo”; Chicago based DJ Alena as “Boys & Girls” and more recently with th..Bart Ricardo hails from Bruges and is one of Belgium’s Preeminent Chicago house proponents to have emerged from his country over the last two decades. \r\nRicardo instinctively learned to mix records when he was only twelve years old in 1992.  His profound passion for house music in combination with his technical skills evidentially landed him DJ stints at parties, major clubs and national radio shows. His unique mixing talent quickly gained unparalleled support and recognition from iconic house artists and Ricardo notoriously shared DJ line-ups at parties with the likes of Derrick Carter, DJ Sneak, Gene Farris, Green Velvet, and Roy Davis Jr. \r\nAfter many travels to Chicago, Ricardo has been considered a local in “The Second City” as he frequently divides his time between his fan base and friends in Europe and “The Windy City”.  He is often invited to appear on US house radio shows and performed in the hottest clubs in major US cities. Frequent gigs all across Europe, tours in Asia in combination with local Belgian residencies made him a respected member of the Chicago house music community.  He always surpassed his own musical boundaries and the amount of time he spends into purist crate digging translates well into his impressive DJ performances.  His audiences rely on him to capture sounds that are housy and cutting-edge, but also sonic landscapes that are classic and timeless.  Ricardo effortlessly sends his crowds into orbit with a blend of jacking Chicago house, deep house, edits, disco, bootlegs and even some lounge and future jazz.\r\nA talented producer, Ricardo first released a track in 2009 on the American imprint: Herbal Essence.  His ever-expanding discography now contains releases on respected house labels such as Farris Wheel Recordings, Gourmand Music, and Frequency Spectrum.  In 2012, he topped the charts of popular stores with his release on Tango Recordings.  He has also shown his talents for remixing with successful projects for Lil’ Mark, Le Babar, and Andrew Emil.  No stranger to collaboration, he has shared productions with DJ Alena (Boys& Girls), Nicolas Kenyon (Kenyon& Ricardo) and more recently with the illustrious: JR From Dallas.\r\nWhile his productions and performances will continuously grow in demand worldwide, Bart Ricardo continues to astound fans and colleagues with his exceptional ability to connect to the dance floor!",

When this particular style was on its return, he discovered house music in the early nineties trough a local radio show. As a kid he collected their tapes and tried to mix some songs with a couple of tape decks. When he started purchasing vinyl on a weekly base in ’97, Dominique got offered a place in the line up of a few local parties. The following years he had residencies in various local clubs & bars.\r\n\r\nIn the first decade of the '00s he had several residencies in clubs all over Belgium & Holland. He also played several times at the Belgian City Parade & had some great parades & festivals in Holland, Germany & Austria.\r\n\r\nBelgium is a difficult country to play underground music so a few years back he made his first step in producing. Together with his best friend Dimitri Chantzis he forms the duo \"Mitrinique\". In the autumn of 2010 their first track Saturday saw the daylight with a superb Eelke Kleijn remix that was played by some of the greatest dj's on the planet. Hernan Cattaneo was one of them, he had this track for many months in his sets. The release schedule looks promising and bookings in the foreign are coming in.\r\n\r\nSummer '11 they lounged their own label \"Sound Avenue\". The first release was immediately a big success! Played & charted by again Hernan Cattaneo, Martin Garcia, Sound Process, Marcelo Vasami, Sander Kleinenberg, Marcus Schulz, Soulfire to name a few,\r\n\r\nDominique's sound is a combination of various genres in electronic music. Many people label him as a progressive dj because of his residencies in some progressive-clubs in the early 2000's. But actually he always has had a interest in many styles. He loves & prefers to play long extended sets. Starting the evening with some downtempo, indie or deephouse and then traveling to more uptempo techhouse or techno sounds, finishing & flying into another dimension with some spacy progressive choons.\r\n",

One record soon became a whole dj-set, called the ‘crazy closing’ and the afterhours enabled him to play a wide range of different styles with music from the 80s till now. Nowadays you can catch Don Cabron as well earlier in the night playing the latest progressive and tech-house on festivals as Tomorrowland, Nova’s Incident, but as well in top-clubs as FUSE & Mirano.. Some rumours about gigs in Brazil 2!In the summer of 2005, Don Cabron organized an Eargasm-party in the amazon-jungle of Peru. For this event, the dj-name Don Cabron (= Mr. Bastard) was created, causing much hilarity under the peruvians!\r\nDon Cabron (dressed in swimsuit & Space Ibiza-shirt with jungle-print ;) played in the afterhours, when the hot sun was coming up and people were dancing into ecstasy at a swimming-pool, in the middle of the beautiful nature of the amazon-jungle.. This was were it all started.. \r\n\r\nLater gigs @ Eargasm Open Air, KetaLoco @ NOXX, Pulse Factory, Creamm, FUSE, Tomorrowland, SILO, Café d'Anvers.. followed. And! \r\n\r\nConcepts:\r\nEargasm Open Air, The Sound of the Undergroud: http://www.Eargasm.info\r\n\r\n& don't forget the KetaLoco-parties..

Even before the Belgium based DJ and producer can even remember he was submerged in sound on a regular basis as his mother took him to the local radio station where she recorded her rock show each week. From then on, he spent any spare time chopping up tunes, making playlists, mixtapes and generally trying to impart his musical taste on anyone willing to listen. \r\n\r\nFast forward to now and the young music obsessive has come good: having been offered a slot at a small but illustrious club in Antwerp, Belgium at the age of 21, Deltano impressed so much he was given a weekly residency and the rest, as they say is history. In 2012 the man has played the likes of Café D’Anvers and Extrema Outdoor Festival in Belgium, whilst having also been booked to play places like Ushuaia in Ibiza and Westerunie in Amsterdam along side the much lauded likes of Luciano, Magda, Dubfire and many more. \r\n\r\nAccording to the man himself, the sets he lays down “tend to have a slightly darker twist in them. I like to build up things really slowly, take everything to a higher level and really enjoy playing long sets because they allow me to tell a better story.”\r\n\r\nInspired throughout his life by a wide array of music from hip-hop to Nirvana via Belgium house, it’s only natural that Deltano produces, too. His deep, part house part techno but basically genre-defiant productions come on labels like Rockets & Ponies, Suara, Inmotion, Rawthentic and Aella Music, all the while getting support from big players in the scene like Nic Fanciulli, Karotte, Matthias Tanzmann, Timo Maas and many more in what eventually resulted in making remixes for respected artists like Santos, Cuartero, The Dolphins, Oliver Moldan and Ilario Liburni to only name a few. Basically this man creates what feels right for him, rather than following any trends of the day, both when producing and DJing. In truth, it always been this way; he has always needed an output for his creativity and music is the perfect fit. \r\n\r\nThe aim of the man whether in club or studio is an honest one: to convey the same experiences and feelings he himself gets from the music he makes, plays and unearths whenever he can… Driven by a real determination and rare passion to succeed Deltano is shaping up as one of the future’s brightest stars.",

  "artist_bio": "Definitely on his way to get a distinctive touch and to distinguish himself. Recently, Dilox goes one step further. The old know picture doesn’t exist anymore… at home, listening trough the beatport jungle has always been a part of his everyday life but his ambitious have changed. Supported by Xentrix, his aim is now about experimenting with sounds and working on a new challenge, simply called: producing. We are proud to see, that our Dj’s are loyal! Loyal to their agency, loyal to us and loyal to each other. That’s the point, what makes us to a family.  \r\nAt his performances, he had the opportunity to be on stage with Technasia, Anthony Rother, Adam Beyer, Marco Bailey, Tom Hades, Klaudia Gawlas so far. Excited about the future!All started with the age of 15 where Dilox aka Alain Mollers went to his first electronic music party named „Katakomben“.This party has impressed him so much that he showed interest to make music himself, and so he bought at the age of 16 his first turntables and vinyls.\r\nHis first musical influences were DJs like Green Velvet, Laurent Garnier, Dave Clarke, Jeff Mills, Christian Vogel, ...\r\nBut he also started to visit Clubs in Belgium like LaVilla, LaRocca, Fuse and many more and gets in contact with the music of this time who is now known as “Retro-House” and the style of Bonzai Music.\r\nGoing to many partys in the years 2000 till now like Mayday, Nature One, Fuse on the Beach and many more he had many musical influences.\r\nBut over time, he was fascinated by the Drum & Bass and Electro Scene too and so he is also mixing Drum & Bass. His musical priorities are nonetheless Techno, Minimal and Tech House.\r\nIn 2011 he won his first DJ Contest at a event in the “Esscobar” Bütgenbach / Belgium against 4 other DJs.\r\n\r\nReferences :\r\nHOT – House of Techno and his Pre-HOT Partys / St.Vith Belgium\r\nStation One Festival / Maldingen Belgium\r\nNature One Camping / Germany\r\nElectronic Moon Sounds / Nidrum Belgium\r\nGrüne Rakete / Trier Germany\r\nFactory 12 / Foetz Luxemburg\r\nRuhr in Love / Oberhausen Germany\r\nBootshaus / Köln Germany\r\nTube Club / St.Wendel Germany\r\n…",

These early UFO parties were the start of a journey that has led him around the globe and\r\nonto some of the World's most recognised underground labels.\r\n\r\nHis production career started after travelling to England, where he created his first tracks in a small studio in South London. \r\n\r\nBack in Belgium his small studio grew in size and the productions he created were picked up, first by UK based techno label 'UFO London' and then by the renowned Detroit techno imprint 'Teknotika Records'.\r\n\r\nHis early tracks such as 'Running in Oktober ' are still talked about today.\r\n\r\nThrough the connections he made,bookings in Denmark Copenhagen began to come in, most notably when he spun for  Bjorn Svin\"s Friends at Vega and Mantra.\r\n\r\nThe 80's most definitely played a huge part in sculpting of his music style, but it was the 90's ..\r\n\r\nReleases with many other quality labels including 'Teknotika Records Detroit' and most famously 'International DJ Gigolos', who gave him the chance to perform his album live in front of his home crowd at the 'I Love Techno' festival in Belgium, has meant that he has well and truly established himself as one of the Europe's most diverse producers.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Phil Moon° has graced some of the best underground parties and events in the World with his DJ sets, taking in the shores of countries both on this and on the other side of the Atlantic",

He is for instance one of the few Belgian DJs to have played in \"Down Town\" Chicago or in \"Webster Hall\" New York and headlined alongside big international names at venues such as I Love Techno, Love Parade, Climax, Mayday, Defqon1, Reverze, Innercity, Tomorrowland, to name some.\r\n\r\nWhen asked about the style of music he plays, DJ Ghost refers to the nature of his sets as \"Acceptable Techno\" or simply \"Good Music!\". If anything, his preference for \"Good Music\" has been apparent since day one and became his trade mark ever since he started in 1994.\r\n\r\nBeside being a DJ, Ghost is also owner of his two record labels, GS2 and Ghoststyle and since recently also his own record company D&G Music, with releases of CJ Bolland, Max Walder, Q-iC, Eric Sneo just to name a few.",

They first met in Caracas where they studied at the Faculty for Architecture and Urban Design.In 2009 they played their first live show opening a Devendra Banhart concert at La Cigale in Paris and shortly afterwards rented an abandoned industrial building in Brussels, which they still use as a recording and performing cruise ship. In 2010 they released an EP (‘Numbered & Signed’) as a limited CD-R edition which they privately distributed among friends. In an interview with the Austrian radio station FM4 they described their music as ‘soulcore junkpop’ and mentioned Greek composer / architect Iannis Xenakis next to Daniel Ash’s side project “Tones on Tail” as two of their main influences. Together with Stuart Argabright (Ike Yard, Death Comet Crew,...) and Julian Jöckel (Midnight Opera) they released an EP under the collaborative name ‘JBLA’ with remixes from the L.I.E.S. camp (Ron Morelli, Svengalisghost and Vereker). Different Fountains debut LP is scheduled to be released on MEAKUSMA / ORRE in spring 2014.",

Dennis..Who is Mr. Caressa ? A small man with some restrictions, but on a musical level, he is flying high ! His lifeline started on the 25th of September 1987 and from early on in his live, he was moved by music. Initially he was into new beat and acid, but friends of him encouraged him to attend a techno party. As of that moment it was clear that Dennis Caressa wanted to be on a techno stage as a dj. A discovery journey into techno started. His big examples were Trish Van Eynde, Tom Hades and Marco Bailley, but as time moves on and more info comes in his musical preference started to change. Dennis got fascinated by Tech House and Minimal. His big examples are Sven Väth, Richie Hawtin, Marco Carola, Ricardo Villalobos, Luciano and Raresh. At age 16 Dennis joined the Pioneer Benelux dj-contest. One of the main jury members on dj-technique was DJ Prinz and he was pleasantly surprised by Dennis’ musical mix. Dennis paved his own road and gradually progressed. Periodically he plays at parties like BOA Summer Sessions, Kissinger, Minimal Royale and Minimalized. Dennis dj-ed along side T.Raumschmiere, Mr. Magnetik, Tom Dazing, Massimo Mephisto, Tecnum, Trish Van Eynde, Tom Hades and Seba Lecompte. For the moment Dennis is focused on creating and producing his own music and sound, which will be released soon.. Check it out ! We can certainly state: Dennis loves his music, it’s an emotion, a lifestyle and everything in his life revolves around that. What the future will bring we all will have to see for Dennis, but it certainly looks very hopeful and promising",

  "artist_bio": "Klaina has been an active force in Belgium's techno scene for years...\r\n\r\nHe became savvy to the sounds of Detroit techno at an early age and has been a stalwart of the music ever since, hosting an \"underground resisting radio show\" called Motorcitysounds and bringing artists like DJ Bone to clubs around Belgium. Much like the records he spins in his three-turntable DJ sets, Klaina's own productions tend to be fast, linear and sci-fi inspired. \r\n\r\nWith his recent debut album released on Bastardo Electrico (IRE), called Synchronized Soul, followed with his \"Relocating Gravity EP\" on Etiketa Records (CR) After having the chance to remix Rennie Fosters \"Good Time Charlie\" track for Subject Detroit records (USA)\r\n\r\nToday with both traditional, and electronic instruments Klaina is continuing hi..At a young age, Klaina was already influenced by the sounds of Art of Noise, Kraftwerk, Jean Michelle Jarre and Eqinox, but all various forms of synthetic sounds and futurisme heavily influenced him. His excursions into different electronic music styles brought him closer and closer to his search for deep inspirational atmospheric sounds.\r\nCarried by the deeply rooted need for more quality, deep shades and the musical techno background he already experienced as a teenager, Dj Bone easely caught his eye on his remarkable DJ skills as a true producer driven by his inner soul... Klaina soon figured out the difference between good music, bad music and Detroit Techno music. Since that time he became infected with the Detroit sound and started practising his turntable skills, driven by the need for experimenting, combining and creating his own sound DJ-ing with,3 turntables was the way to push his message through . The need to get his message out there kept on grewing and pulled him into the world of producing. I'ts no wonder he got discovered by Electronic Art Recordings, Subject Detroit, Bastardo Electrico and Etiketa Records requesting him to produce specific tracks to support the labels on its mission...\r\nHis DJ-sets are what he stands for, his productions are what he believes in, an expression of his inner world, the urge to give something to people....\r\nToday with both traditional, and electronic instruments Klaina is continuing his own path through the electronic world, Co-hosting and promoting Motorcitysounds radioshow and events in cooperation with Trish Van Eynde.",

  "artist_bio": "\r\nDerlich began to experiment with sound manipulation back in 2006, where upon an unrealised desire to create a certain feeling and aesthetic left him unsatisfied with his initial work.\r\nAfter years of experimentation, natural progression lead him towards the darker and more extreme sides of music. In searching for feelings and answers, his passion for art, derelict landscapes, and abandoned locations feeds the inspiration to work in this shadowy area of electronic music. \r\nUtilising elements of abstract noise, techno, and Industrialism, Derlich's music is deep, dark and hypnotic experimentalism at its very best. \r\n\r\nAfter much work refining this, his own singular sound, Derlich's first release finally came to light in 2011, with the well received 'Dying Cities, Abandoned Lives EP' on Singularity Recordings (A label with whom he has since released a further three EPs).\r\n\r\nIn a live environment, Derlich uses a combination of DJ and Live PA elements to create a brutal and hypnotic wall of texture and sound.",

Wax flying off cd players /effect, mixer knobs twisting back and forth, volume levers being slapped up and down, music cutting in and out, all while the hard banging beat never stops. And to take the already riveting experience even higher, he’s even more into it than you are, banging his head, waving his arms, screaming intensely at you. His sets are as dynamic and exciting, as they are electronicly feeded and pumpin’. But never do they lose sight of the fact that you are there for one reason: to dance your ass, and eventually your feet off.\r\n\r\nThere is always groove in his hard but tranzy tracks. A hard groove that makes you move into a frenzy. And when you think you can’t take anymore, he starts pushing you on further with some oldskool killers, because you can always worry about tiredness later.\r\n\r\nDIMIX is the first person to admit that he’s is hyperactive, works hard, plays hard, cannot sleep on planes, and stresses about things constantly. In essence, he is in his own living, going hard. Breathing and a can of extra energy in close reach. But it seems that his hyperactive nature is clearly one of the two major driving forces behind his success as a DJ. His need to constantly change, evolve, and just plain “do,” is what distinguishes his music/performance from other DJs.\r\n\r\nSame way on the poduction level you can excpect that particular DIMIX vibe in his tracks. According to DIMIX he says “I want to feel the same pumping feeling that u can find in my sets which are dynamic and driven.” You can find his releases soon under the new UK label “Glamour Punk Recordings”.\r\n\r\nAppreciating his talent, and seeing how well he controlled and teased his audience, the word spread to other clubs and pretty soon he was guesting regularly across the country.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, after a worldwide promotion, clubs and event managers caught on to the DIMIX magic. Since then gigs have taken him to some of the hottest clubs and events around the globe like,\r\n\r\nFirz (France), Audioligy (Germany), Electronique (Italy),\r\nSun Dance Music Festival (Estonia),\r\nStatus (Turkey), Oliver’s (Jordan-Amman),\r\nPacha (La Pineda), Summer Nights Ibiza (Aqaba Beach),\r\nKraftwerk (Germany), Privilege Ibiza World Tour (Global),\r\nZooproject (Ibiza), El Divino (Ibiza), Judgement Sundays (Ibiza),\r\nRandom at Hush (Ibiza), Kanya (Ibiza),\r\nChocolate Club (Shenzhen-China), Café Del Mar (Singapore),\r\nLake View (Koh Samui-Thailand), …\r\n\r\nTune in every other week to DIMIX' Essential Selected Radio Show via :\r\nwww.eclecticradio.nl/show/dimix-essential-selected\r\n\r\nTop of the bill : Catch DIMIX this summer at Judgement Sundays in Eden/Ibiza via :\r\nwww.judgementsundays.co.uk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Ever since he had been working as a record shop employee initially and then starting his first slow moves towards becoming a DJ, Dimitri Pike was dedicating himself more and more to a consistent development of his own master plan in terms of “Techno/House”. Mostly having the function of a guest DJ at first, he then became a resident in some very respected clubs in Northern France and the south of Belgium, where he also found his home later on. There he started the radio emission “The Tuesday Session”, which has been supporting the French techno scene as a solid underground radio show trademark until today. Once then a first EP named “Night Works” got released on Mirage Records, it found the often necessary and sustainable support in the scene by DJs like Oliver Kapp, Damon Wild, Claus Bachor, Roland Casper or Detroit’s Derrick Thompson. In 2003 Dimitri Pike managed to make his own first contact with the music scene of Detroit! Sean Deason released the Dimitri Pike Remix of the legendary Motor City anthem “The Shit”, which came as a remix package including other interpretations from Kelli Hand, Christian Bloch and John Clees and advanced to one of the best and most sold Techno records of 2004 in Germany among others.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsequently, Pike played at Tresor Club in Berlin shortly afterwards and subsequently deferred to a cooperation with Frequency Berlin - a generally well-known DJ collective from Berlin that is supporting the productions of Claude Young, Pacou, Sender Berlin etc. In the year 2005 Pike got booked by the Electric Avenue Camp for the after show party at Detroit’s “Fuse-In” festival, where he was standing behind the decks masterfully together with several international top notch DJs and producers. In addition, he simultaneously contributed an exclusive track to DJ Bone’s Mix CD “Subject Detroit Vol. 03”, which instantly became one of the most remarkable tracks on this mix compilation. A year later he then got the offer from Jamal Moss to produce the remix of a Chicago House classic by Windy City’s veteran Steve Pointdexter. The response to this remix could also be assessed as being quite excellent and thus unveiled that Dimitri Pike was capable of handling different styles of music in a qualified manner. As a result this track was introduced by Ben Sims and Chris Finke in the “Split Show” and not only got evaluated equally high by their audience as some profound judgments did reveal.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the current situation of the minimal techno downfall and a renaissance of the techno planets Chicago and Detroit, Pike is very much concerned about presenting multifarious techno/house sets to his audience and simultaneously develop himself further through his work as a DJ and producer, whereas others rather dread exposed performances due to a shrinking market and increasing competition therein. Thus in 2007, Pike eventually took another challenge as being the label head for “Wildub”,  a branch of “Wildtek Virtual”, which is taking up the cause of production and development for worldwide musical concepts. His steadily growing intercontinental contacts and the European Tour of Detroit Techno Militia in 2008 together with his DTM buddies Angie Schwendemann and Tom Linder finally lead him through his home country, where Pike organized DTM parties and thereby  moved up to becoming a recognized “313 soldier” as well. This generated the prelude to a series of events that is still evolving consistently in 2009 and is actually engaging no lesser protagonists of the Neo-Detroit-Genre than Shamus Coghlan, Vergel Evans and Marcel Heese in the now established “In Space with…” party serials. After another production for the latest “Mathematics” label compilation CD [CD/2x12”] of Jamal Moss, Dimitri Pike is crafting on his own convincing live set since the beginning of this year and this mission still continues . . .",

  "artist_bio": "No nonsense - just techno.\r\nResident at Hertz, Antwerp.Instantly triggered by the versatility of the techno genre, Wouter aka Double U Jay started buying his first records in 2004. Extremely motivated to discover the art of deejaying he started practicing. This motivation quickly led to the first bookings at the Koloso club (Cherrymoon - Lokeren). This is where he discovered how to get the crowd's attention and how to get a floor in motion - playing numerous warm-up sets and later on performing at peak time.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 the giglist expanded with performances at major parties in Belgium such as Bassleader, Evolutionz NYE, Pro-Jekt and Laundry Day. But most importantly, in November that year the one and only DAVE CLARKE selected him to open the Red Room at the infamous I LOVE TECHNO event in Belgium - claiming that his mixes 'told a story' and 'he deserved it'. A dream come true, at the tender age of 22.\r\n\r\nThe following years would not only get him playing at gigs in the whole of Belgium but also abroad - spreading his signature energetic techno sound. Getting involved to kickstart the techno-scene again in Belgium is also key… think BASIK, Liberty White, Hertz, Area 51… with numerous passages at above mentioned concepts - Double U Jay fully supports the newly emerging scene. As Hertz resident in Antwerp, he found a comfortable setting to further develop his style and fully back the number one techno concept in Antwerp and beyond.\r\n\r\nIt has become clear that the main focus is and always will be on deejaying, being an entertainer, getting kicks out of creating combo's and being in control of an audience waiting for your next trick, track or move. However, producing has become a true must in the current music scene. \r\n\r\nTill then, see you on the dancefloor… no nonsense… just techno!",

  "name": "Frank De Wulf",
  "profile_photo": "http://www.residentadvisor.net/images/profiles/frankdewulf.jpg",
  "cover_photo": "",
  "artist_bio": "When releasing new material, and especially when it has been so long as it was with Frank De Wulf  ;) …. you are kind of expected to tell a little bit about yourself. So, here you’ll find a quick overview of his career. You’ll discover how one thing led to another, without getting into too much detail. \r\nFrank was born in 1968 as the youngest of three boys. Of course with 2 older brothers hanging around, he was introduced to all kinds of music, not just the mainstream tracks you heard on the radio. \r\nHe must have been about 10 when he started experimenting with tape decks, later he used his father’s 2-track recorder to make longer versions of hit records. \r\nIn high school, he got invited by one of his classmates to visit the local radio station. Impressed with their set-up, he asked if he could try mixing on their 2 ‘Technics SL1200 MK2’ turntables. It felt great! From there he got his own radio show called “Seventh Heaven Radio”. With Frank on the turntables and another guy doing the talking, they brought a whole new flavor to the dance hits of that time. By re-editing, remixing and manipulating the tracks, he wanted to create a particular atmosphere for the listeners and give them the idea that they were experiencing a live set from home.\r\n\r\nFrank De Wulf was always into music with a strong, original sound & rhythm no matter the genre: from new wave, dance, electro European and American experimental post-punk with Kraftwerk and the Art of Noise as two of his major influences or dare he say “muses”. That fresh, energetic layered electro sound was something he aspired to bring himself, by creating his own music as well as through his work as a DJ. \r\nAfter a while people started noticing his‘work’ and around 1985, he was asked to do a show by a more ‘dance oriented’ radio station called ‘SIS’.\r\n\r\nAt the time he was regularly, DJ-ing in 2 of Ghent’s dance café’s. It was an excellent way to practice his skills and since he was still at school, these DJ gigs brought some extra money into his piggy bank … because he was also saving up to buy the Yamaha S7000 sampler and an ATARI 1024 Computer. The new beat movement had just started and he started to feel the need to create music rather than just mix other people’s work more and more. So he started to produce his own tracks and make remixes of existing tracks. \r\nOne of his first releases as musician/producer was the 12-inch Acid Rock track with his alter ego band Rhythm Device on Music Man Records. Thanks to Olivier Pieters, resident DJ at the famous night club Boccacio (one of the Belgian clubs where New Beat really took off), he could test run the track. To Frank’s surprise and great relief, the crowd loved it. The track became a big hit, and is now seen as a bit of a classic, or so he’s told. \r\n\r\nHis work as a DJ gave him the idea to make a record just for DJ’s. He wanted to create a kind of tool for mixing tracks while still keeping the familiar theme going. He started to work on several tracks, but due to a lack of time never really got to finish them. He had a series of beats, mixes and samples from international dance hits and newly created sounds that were not really fit to be released as a-side records. So still eager to release them, he decided to call them The B-Sides. The record went through the roof and he ended up releasing 4 volumes (on Music Man Records) plus remixes of them.\r\nDue to the success of the B-sides, Frank was asked to give live performances as well as do DJ sets all over the world. He traveled around Europe, the States and Australia. It was a remarkable period, he met up with other performers and DJ’s, who where all starting their musical careers, people like Joey Beltram, Moby, Derrick May, Sven Väth. They all shared this great appreciation for each other’s work and Frank really felt that people understood his work. With each new sample or musical idea there was this immense reaction on the dance floor. He really felt that the crowd was on his side, the whole time pushing him on and inspiring him to break new boundaries. During his career, there was also Renaat, the owner of R&S records, who kept him inspired and focused. Renaats energy, drive and strong believe in the success of quality dance music had a major influence on Frank’s career.\r\n\r\nHe decided to start up his own record labels which gave him more creative freedom to release his tracks and do production work for other artists; like remixes for all kinds of artists in and outside the new beat scene like The Shamen & Erasure but also The Orb, Jam & Spoon, Orbital, Biosphere,…\r\n\r\nAt the end of the nineties Frank felt, he had reached the limits of what he could do with music at that period in time and decided to concentrate on another great love of his: the world of film and post-production.\r\n\r\nHe founded “GRID” a post-production company specialized in visual effects and motion design for commercials, video clips and films. He kept his musical career going at the back burner doing the odd remix or DJ set. And on a personal level he met his wife Sandra in the year 2000 and in 2003 they became the proud parents of a lovely daughter Ellen.\r\n\r\nSo there you are… even though Franks work kept him quite busy and was creatively challenging, music is a part of who he is. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he always knew that this time would come. And now, he can no longer ignore this need to make music, this need to create and let the magic flow again. He hopes you will all enjoy the ride! \r\n\r\n\r\nAs we hope you know, the 5th volume of the B-sides, a series of 6 brand new tracks from Frank De Wulf,  is mastered, released  and currently available on all digital portals. \r\n\r\nThe new tracks will be followed by the ‘old volumes’ which are being released for the first time ever on digital download sites. Each few weeks another  ‘volume’ will be available. \r\n\r\nNext to that, Frank is also launching a remix contest of his very first hit single ‘Acid Rock’ as Rhythm Device  … he’s dying to find out what other producers ( known and unknown ) will do to the track.  \r\n\r\nTHE B-SIDES  \r\n\r\nRelease schedule:\r\n\r\nThursday, April 15th    :    The B-sides n° 1\r\nTuesday, May 5th     :     The B-Sides n° 2 \r\nTuesday, May 25th   :    The B-Sides  n° 3\r\nTuesday, June 16th  :     The B-Sides n° 4 \r\nTuesday, July 7th     :     Beyond The B-Sides \r\n\r\nInfo : \r\nAll Frank’s output will, from now on, be released on The B-Sides label : The B-sides label is thé outlet for Frank De Wulfs own music. The label is to be distinguished from the B-Sides series. The series have their own specific sound and intention towards the dance-floor. The label will also be open to other projects and musical directions. It can be seen as a personal label that explores Frank De Wulfs favorite music and the way he makes music himself. Off course the B-sides series ( both old and new) will also be (re)released on this label. The idea is to open the label up for other genres within the ‘dance scene’ and everything around it, from loungey club tracks to more experimental sounds and tracks next to the occasional summer club tracks or remixes, with the common thread that they will all be Frank De Wulf productions.\r\n\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "..Music has no limits. It’s a statement applicable to the most adventurous artists, whose passion sends them running further and further to satisfy the demanding and oh-so-alluring mistress of the endless beat. Fernando Costantini is undoubtedly enslaved by this domineering mantra, and his submission has sent him bouncing all over the world imparting the message he himself has been entranced by.\r\n\r\nGrowing up in Belgium but with Italian origins, Fernando absorbed the music in his family home from an early age, as his father played Italian classics, soul and funk and his older brother engaged with electronic music from the early 90s. At a time when Chicago house and Detroit techno were exploding in Belgium, he would take every opportunity to turn on the decks as soon as his brother would leave the house. As he grew to seek out his own music, so his own collection of disco, jazz, soul and funk came together from hours spent digging in second hand record markets. \r\n\r\nNaturally, as he grew in confidence so came the desire to share his passion with others, although as he continued to learn more about all kinds of music he never entertained the prospect of making it his profession. However along the way there were key characters that saw the twinkle in his eye and recognized his potential. \r\n\r\nAs he blossomed as a DJ, of course his curiosity led him into music production, keen to have his own unique sounds at his disposal to add to his artistry, not to mention unveiling the mystery of where the music he loved so much came from. Hours have been spent experimenting with different processes, building up a formidable arsenal of tracks steadily seeing the light of day from his first vinyl release on Karton through to appearances on Dana Ruh’s Brouqade Records, Loquace’s Earlydub and many more respected labels. As well as building upon his solo work, he has always been an enthusiastic collaborator, working with Alexander Kyosev, Oshana (as Ferosh), not to mention kicking off the F&A Project with Anthea.  \r\n\r\nHaving established himself as a recognisable artist in his own right, Fernando has spent the past few years playing key parties and festivals around the world from Paris to Tokyo to New York to Mexico to Ibiza to London. Such notorious events as Fuse, Sonus, BPM, Sonar and Dommune have called upon his talents, each one feeding more experience and inspiration into his distinctive style. \r\n\r\nIn his own words these opportunities have only pushed him further into his addiction, every new tune opening a new door of inspiration into another label, another sound, another microcosm within the ever-expanding realms of music. This can only lead Fernando down ever more exciting paths of exploration, soaking in every experience and idea in every part of the globe, ever in service to that one key message; music has no limits. As long as he stays obedient to the instruction, we can be sure to be equally entranced.",

  "artist_bio": "Cross-fertilize...Mowar frontman and eternal philosopher Franco Cangelli pretty much got absorbed by electronic music ever since his early teens when it was all about popping and breakdancing. During the late 80’s house and techno emerged and ravaged his mind. Franco experienced the whole evolution from the early acid house days, the Belgian new beat, the elegance of Detroit techno, the experimental sounds from the UK… This is probably why his dj-sets are never limited to the last top 10 charts. Electronic music should be a soul-searching experience, not a circus act.\r\n\r\nEven though he caught the disease from an early age, he took to the decks and started producing rather late as studying didn’t always agree with wasting money on vinyl. After graduating in ’98, he started experimenting with a slow computer, exploring various sounds and genres for the next seven years. In 2005 he released his first record and went on to record for various labels such as Sushitech, Seventh Sign, Persistencebit, Self Defence and his own imprints the now defunct Aesthetik (co-run with Dj Akî) and his current label Mowar.\r\n\r\nPeople familiar with Franco Cangelli’s production work will undoubtedly notice a strong influence from Detroit, albeit spiced with more edgy electronics and textures, exploring both melodic and stripped down techno. His Raw Emotion ep on Persistencebit is a strong example of a more melodic approach, while his recent Paper Cut ep on Mowar stands for a more dubbed out approach. A constant battle between less and more if you will… More releases are in the pipeline on new label Self Defence and of course Mowar, so watch out.\r\n\r\nHis dj-sets have the same firm open-mindedness, aimed at taking people on an emotional journey blending the dark and stripped with the deep and melancholic. Having both played at big events such as the 10 Days Off festival in Gent and smaller clubs such as the Moog in Barcelona, he developed his own unique way to convey the warmth and intensity of electronic music to the dancefloor.\r\n\r\nMowar & Nowar\r\n\r\nMowar stands for uncompromising quality deep techno. Franco started Mowar in 2008 releasing his Wee Funk ep. The label gained immediate support from people like Derrick May, Deetron, Fabrice Lig, Angel Molina, Dan Curtin and more. Mowar went on to release other producers like Lee Holman, Roberto Bosco, Aubrey and Ozka, with remixes by Russ Gabriel, Lerosa, Mike Parker, Pendle Coven, Peter Van Hoesen…\r\n\r\nHe also co-runs Nowar, the evil twin-sister of Mowar, with Dj Akî. Nowar is rather aimed at releasing quality house music for the more sophisticated dancefloors, working with producers such as The Parkwalker (aka Affie Yusuf), Hakim Murphy and Duijn & Douglas.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Encouraged by a friend to play her music Fady One immediately felt comfortable behind the mixing desks. However, it was not until three years later, with the launch of her first club night, that she took mixing more seriously\r\n\r\nOn a musical note, Fady One doesn’t want to define her style. She mixes what appeals to her and doesn’t want to feel restricted by classifications. Listening to music, she says, is like listening to people. It is a very personal thing and you can hear how the music whispers to you, talks to you, shouts at you or even cries. She compares discovering a new piece of music to meeting a person: with some people you feel an immediate connection. A few may even fascinate or bewitch you, whereas others appear to be empty and you are just not tuned to the same wavelength. \r\n\r\nHaving always liked to organise events she felt that her own club night would not only be a fun thing to do but also give her the opportunity to play the music she likes for a bigger audience. Having started with less than 150 guests in a small bar in 2007, Soirées Secrets (renamed Zukunft in March 2009) quickly developed into one of the most popular club nights in Brussels. \r\n\r\nThe soirée is designed to offer artists the chance to express themselves and to share their passion for music and art with like-minded people. As a matter of fact, Zukunft regularly invites guest DJs, other musicians and bands as well as all sorts of artists who get the chance to expose their works. Amongst them were Undo, Spada, Luciano Pizzella, Davis & May, Opuswerk, Max Cooper, Kollektiv Turmstrasse, Nhar, Pierre, Cora Novoa, Van Hai, Deg, Darko... \r\n\r\nIn Brussels Fady One mixes at events such as Piknikelektronik, No Code, Wunderbar, Statik Dancing, Brussels4Paris, Vert Pop, Summer Club, Apéros Urbains and Tilt. Furthermore, she regularly plays in different locations amongst them are Café Central, Wax Club, Fuse, K-nal, Café Bota, Club des Halles, Mirano and Ancienne Belgique.",

  "artist_bio": "Who would have thought, a decade has passed, and the dream of becoming rock stars took a surprised twist. They found themselves shifting their interests to dance music when they were introduced to Roger Sanchez, Masters at Work and David Morales.Here’s a story about two brothers. The Wilmaers brothers. Kids of the seventies. Both having the ball of their lives when vinyl was king and 8 track tapes were creating history. Then, mid-eighties arrived. The brothers grew up. They got influenced immensely by The Police, U2 and Simple Minds. With the older brother on the guitar and kid brother on the drums, they formed a band with few close allies, all felt strongly destined to become rock stars of the future.\r\n\r\nWho would have thought, a decade has passed, and the dream of becoming rock stars took a surprised twist. They found themselves shifting their interests to dance music when they were introduced to Roger Sanchez, Masters at Work and David Morales. A whole new perspective on dance music emerged and shone through the whole eurotrance culture that was ruling the Belgian airwaves at that moment, and the boys started experimenting with loops and disco samples. Their very first few US style house tracks saw the light.\r\n\r\nArmed with those house tracks, the boys approached Headroom label boss Bart Grinaert, who saw the potential in them and took them under his wings. The Headroom gang taught Bert and Maarten all they needed to know about dance music – the beats, the sounds and plenty of studio tricks. After a few releases under several monikers, they decided to go with ‘Filterheadz’, with the idea of releasing some more ‘filterdisco’ records.\r\n\r\nThe turning point for Filterheadz arrived when Jo Casters, head of A&R at Mostika found some of their early works on his desk. Jo got in touched with the brothers, and requested for a long string of remixes. Minimalistix’s ‘Struggle for Pleasure’ stood out amongst the rest. But Jo wanted more. The boys headed off to Ibiza to check out the vibe and discovered the whole Sasha&Digweed thing. With the sounds of Space Terrace still ringing in their ears, they headed straight to their studio upon returning, and started working on remixes that made it to the become the very few biggest progressive tracks of the decade.  Now standing for ‘progressive but with tougher beats and a sharper edge, remixes for Hooj, Platipus, Nebula & Deviant immediately followed, thus establishing themselves as ‘first call’ remixers.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, collaborations with Zzino & Tomaz proved to be prolific, as their techno output on Headroom labels Session and Traction started flowing, finding flavour with Carl Cox, Bailey and the likes. Intec eventually got in touched and asked for ‘latin techno tracks’. ‘Sunshine’ and ‘Latin Loopworks’ ended up being THE Ibiza favourite, and THE massive summer anthem for that year.\r\n\r\nOffers to remix big hits like Green Velvet’s ‘LaLa Land’, Bedrock’s ‘Emerald’, Whatever Girl’s ‘Activator’, Eddie Amador’s ‘House Music’, Kira’s ‘I’ll be Your Angel’, just to name a few, further reinforced their fast rising status of highly acclaimed producers. And as if garnering the best ever selling techno record in history wasn’t enough, the brothers decided to go for another challenge. In their debut mix CD Tribalicious, tribal monsters, tech beats, spacious overtones and some downright offbeat stuff were reworked, remixed, rebuilt, and abused (quite ironically) to perfection. And the Filterheadz sound was further armored and recognized.\r\n\r\n2004 WMC marked yet another history in the making for the boys, when ‘Yimanya’ created huge waves to become another Ibiza monster tune, so huge that it was made Pete Tong’s essential new tune. So huge that support from house, techno and trance DJs alike were massive. Just about anyone from across the dance floors to the consoles, from Tong to Sander to Jules to Tiesto – were all supporting ‘Yimanya’ in full force. Extensive DJ tours soon followed, but they still found time to remix for Faithless, Dido, Delerium, Tranquility Base as well as the biggest dance tune of 2004: Eric Prydz’s ‘Call on Me’.\r\n\r\n2005 witnessed the birth of Love Distortion – a label wholly owned by Filterheadz. It is remarkably a dynamic move, as they continued to shine by releasing a few more big hits ‘Endless Summer’, ‘Cartagena’, ‘Santiago’ – this time under their very own label, receiving all-round support again, nonetheless.",

After a couple of early remixes it was their debut E.P. on Red D’s label We Play House Recordings that allowed them to come into house music prominence. The tracks ‘Let’s Go’ and ‘More Than Seven’ – featuring Belgian jazz diva Lady Linn -became staple songs for a who’s who of house DJ’s old and new and helped kick start the oldskool house revival of recent years.\r\n\r\nRemixing Audiojack’s ‘Stay Glued’ into a monster beat that definitely did control dance floors all over the world proved that FCL wasn’t just a one hit wonder and predicted that it was just a matter of time before FCL would hit that zone between underground and crossover. An unlikely remake of an old Chicago house standard was FCL’s ticket out of the underground and into the bigger spotlight. Released as a 150 copies vinyl-only release on We Play House Recordings, FCL’s version of ‘It’s You’ – again with Lady Linn on vocals - was soon the object of affection for hundreds of DJ’s and punters alike and a digital licensing of the track by house music moguls Defected did the rest. FCL’s ‘It’s You’ – the San Soda Panorama Bar Acca Version (the only version, simply named like that after a serious Panorama Bar Sunday morning set) – became part of collective house history. ‘It’s You’ was subsequently remixed by a string of legends from MK to Larry Heard via David Morales to Mousse T.\r\n\r\nBut just like FCL had a long and fruitful life before ‘It’s You’, so they will in the near future. The follow-up to ‘It’s You’ came out on We Play House Recordings in the summer of 2014. 'Can We Try' again featured Lady Linn on vocals and has been remixed by Deetron. Recently FCL also had the honor to do a remix for that other UK house stronghold Crosstown Rebels, giving Kele Okereke’s ‘Candy Flip’ the FCL treatment.\r\n\r\nKicking off 2015 they will curate an exciting volume in the Defected In The House mix compilation series, that will provide a lasting testament to their DJ’ing and vinyl digging abilities. Further in 2015 you can expect new singles & remixes. FCL: house music for all…",

  "artist_bio": "Founder/A&R of Curle Recordings. Collecting/playing vinyl as Fader.Fader is a busy bee in the Belgian scene. He started out as a music journalist for several magazines and at the age of 21 he became responsable for the bookings at the famous Fuse club in Brussels. At N.E.W.S. in Ghent, the biggest indie dance music distributor in the Benelux, he now assists in handling labels such as Music Man and Eskimo.\r\n\r\nThere he also got the chance to start up his own imprint Curle Recordings in 2006. The label quickly made itself a name with 12”s from Mark August, Dub Kult, Anthony Collins and Efdemin. Some of the tracks got licensed to mixes from Sven Väth and Richie Hawtin amongst others. In 2008 the first Curle CD, mixed by Efdemin, got released to high international acclaim. The accompanying single ‘America’ made it to the 1 spot in the Groove charts. 2009 brought contributions from Martyn, John Beltran and Convextion. In 2010, to celebrate the 25th Curle 12”, the first label compilation “So Far (So Good)” got released on CD, also including a mix-cd from Fader. Furthermore there was new music from Thomas Brinkmann, Peter Van Hoesen, Nina Kraviz… 2011 brought Scott Grooves, Roman Flügel and Patrice Scott to the label, next to new material from Efdemin. And there was a Matt O’Brien live CD. \r\n2012 looks promising, with releases from Resoe, Pablo Bolivar, Conforce and Jonas Kopp.\r\n\r\nFader is DJ’ing since 1997 and plays a blend of deep techno, mnml and house. Constantly looking for those special tracks, but always with the dancefloor in mind. He already played at all the most important clubs and parties throughout Belgium, such as I Love Techno (twice), Fuse & Silo (countless times), 10 Days Off, Kozzmozz, Ancienne Belgique, Brussels Electronic Music Festival, City Parade, Fuse On The Beach… \r\nThere he shared the decks with Richie Hawtin, Ricardo Villalobos, Jeff Mills, Efdemin, Marcel Dettmann, Ben Klock, Joris Voorn, Adam Beyer, Raresh, Luciano, Reboot, Shed, Seth Troxler, Tama Sumo, Prosumer, Sascha Dive, Thomas Brinkmann, Atom TM, Robert Hood, Carl Craig, Agoria, Paul Kalkbrenner, Laurent Garnier, Len Faki and James Holden just to name a few. \r\nNext to that there’s the occasional booking in Finland, Holland (Doornroosje), Berlin (Maria am Ostbahnhof, Suicide Circus, Chez Jacki), Hamburg (Golden Pudel), Geneva (Weetamix), Barcelona (East Ender festival)… \r\nFrom time to time you can also hear Fader on Switch, the dance show on national radio station Studio Brussels. Because of his many occupations there hasn’t been time yet for own productions, apart from the odd studio session with his good friend Peter Van Hoesen. One day…",

  "artist_bio": "Techno Soul & Futuristic Funk !\r\nFabrice Lig, inspired by the techno Soul of Detroit techno, the spirit of Jazz and Soul, the groove from Funk music & the beats of N-Y 80's Electro music. All these inspirations together to bring some techno soul and futuristic funk on some cream of the cream labels like Planet E, Versatile, F-Communications & Third Ear (Soul Designer), 7th City,KMS, Submerge,Trapez Limited (Mauler), Kanzleramt,Delsin,Motech,Raygun,Residual,Compost,70 drums to name but a few...Fabrice Lig is considered a world class producer by his peers & techno fans around the globe. He is well known for his particularly funky use of Roland’s sh101 analog synth, and for his particularly emotional and personal melodies and harmonies.\r\nThere is no doubt that after more than 20 years of teaching himself production processes, complex midi programming and harmonies, Fabrice’s sound is unique and very recognisable among the thousands of weekly techno releases.\r\nDemonstrations of his skills appear on the crème de la crème of electronic music labels such as KMS (Kevin Saunderson) , Planet-e (Carl Craig), Submerge, R&S, Third Ear,  7th City Records (Dan Bell), F-Communications (Laurent Garnier) , Versatile, Classic, Compost, Subject Detroit, Motech, Raygun, Playhouse Records, Kanzleramt (Heiko Laux), 70 Drums (Ken Ishii), Clone, Trapez ltd and so on….An exceptional discography into mythic labels, into the history of electronic music.\r\n  \r\nBy the end of 1998, after his first DJ and production experiences, under the Interwaves and Bug Orchestra nicknames, Fabrice was elevated to the ranks of the Detroit musical elite by Mad Mike himself, thanks to his classic remix of E-Dancer’s Banjo track on KMS: “Fabrice is a part of Detroit music's history by being the first white producer to record on KMS, and the first double groove recording from NSC”.\r\n  \r\nFabrice has built a solid discography and reputation, confirmed by his reknowned appearances at the world’s best clubs & festivals such as Panorama Bar-Berlin, Fabric - London, Womb-Tokyo, Detroit - Fuse-In Festival, Fuse - Brussels, Loft - Barcelona, Sub Club - Glasgow, The End - London, Sonar Festival, the world famous official Montreux Jazz Festival, Bourges festival (on stage with Jean-Michel Jarre), to name but a few. One of the highlights of Fabrice’s dj career is the paper in the Detroit Free press where his performance was voted best dj set of 2005’s Detroit Fuse-in Festival.\r\n \r\nFabrice also collaborated with and remixed many artists as Laurent Garnier, Kevin Saunderson, Agoria, DJ Hell, Ken Ishii, Kenny Hawkes, Rob Mello, Frederic Galliano, Chymera, Trüby Trio…\r\n\r\nAfter his last Soul Designer's album on Third Ear (2007), Fabrice decided to take a bit of a break from music and concentrate on some educational projects. Nevertheless, he released his classic Purple Raw EP on Versatile in that period, as well as some EPs on R&S, Subject Detroit, .. next to a few remixes. Over the last few months however, Fabrice quietly prepared the celebration of 20 years of music by producing a new album with the idea to make a strong “come back” with fresh material for late 2014.\r\n\r\nAnd when Carl Craig first heard \"Galactic Soul Odysseys\", he instantly decided to invite Fabrice to join Planet E's prestigious family. Once again, Fabrice’s work is entering music’s history through one of the most respected labels in the techno community. Fabrice is really excited to be back on tour for live performances around the globe and to present this new material to his fans...\r\n\r\n…As Jean-Michel Jarre said in an interview for MTV :  “What is touching me in Fabrice Lig's career is the way he is following his own line, without caring about trends, and that's the path an artist should follow. It is not post Detroit, it's an emotion ».",

  "artist_bio": "Ed Nomi is quickly becoming one of the most revered Minimal artists in Antwerp.\r\nHe is an Antwerp native whose music can be defined as: atmospheric, dark and with an extensive use of fx.Growing up in Antwerp as a teenager, Ed Nomi was into techno but with time he got deep into jazz and funk. In 2005 he began composing and producing music (experimental, soundscapes and jazz) for different bands like Phazon One, Darkvolt and Chameleons on the Run.\r\nSince 2009 he did many performances in bars, venues, museums, made some soundtracks for short films and has been releasing music on iTunes & Bandcamp.\r\nIn 2013, Ed Nomi was introduced to Minimal Techno and felt an instant connection to the drive and vibe of Minimal, he immediately translated his sound palette and producing techniques to this style of music. With a huge collection of hardware instruments this only took minimal (no pun intended) trial & error.\r\n\r\nFor the next year, if he wasn’t producing minimal and preparing his live set, he was expanding his modular synth or scanning the web for interesting minimal music and various sources of inspiration.\r\n\r\nMusic has always been an important part of Ed Nomi's life, his early experimental/soundscape exploits counter-balanced the more considered approach needed to learn piano & electronic saxophone. These earlier experiences add much character to his signature sound too.\r\nIt’s obvious that with so much effort put into the music, his productions improve at an impressive pace, have subtleness and stay musically interesting.\r\n\r\nHe’s a true musician & perfectionist.\r\n'minimal music, maximal devotion'",

Rencontre musicale, oui, mais aussi humaine.\r\n2006. Hi-Coon, jeune DJ Liègeois, évolue dans le monde de la musique électronique depuis quelques années déjà. \r\nConstamment à la recherche de nouvelles sonorités, il s’entraine jour après jour, \r\n peaufinant son style et ses gestes sur les sons de ses artistes préférés.  \r\n« La musique a toujours été importante pour moi.  Depuis tout petit,\r\n je cherchais l’instrument qui me permettrait d’exprimer ce que je ressentais, qui me permettrais d’être moi.  \r\nLes platines, je suis tombé dessus un peu par hasard.  Mais ce fut la révélation : tous les instruments en un ! J’étais libre… »\r\nPas très loin de là, G-Drums fait son petit bonhomme de chemin également.  \r\n Lui aussi connaît bien la musique électronique, et pour cause : il est né dedans !  « A six ans, je suivais mon père DJ partout. \r\nJe dormais même dans les fly-cases », raconte-t-il en souriant.  \r\nDix ans plus tard, sans grande surprise, il s’essaye aux platines… s’ensuit alors un parcours étonnant, \r\nslalomant entre Drum’n’bass et Hard-teck pour en arriver à Techno.\r\nMixant dans des clubs tels Les Planches, le Factory ou l’Inside Out et étant résident dans l’ASBL Techno-Process,\r\nle jeune DJ vit pleinement sa passion.\r\nEn 2007, les deux Liégeois se rencontrent.  Tout de suite, au-delà de l’amitié qu’ils se portent, ils se comprennent musicalement.  \r\nIls créent Feesh-Tix : « Hi-Coon apporte de l’extravagance, un petit grain de folie à la précision et la technique de G-drums. \r\nIls se complètent parfaitement », m’explique-t-on.   Refusant de se cantonner à un style, \r\nils marient leurs différentes inspirations, naviguant entre House, Techno et Minimale au gré de leur plaisir.\r\nEclectiques, passionnés et de surcroît sympathiques, ils ne poursuivent qu’un seul but : faire bouger les gens ! \r\n« Lorsque l’on joue, ce qu’on l’on cherche, c’est à s’amuser, et ce plaisir que l’on prend aux platines, \r\n on veut que les gens le ressentent, on veut qu’ils dansent, qu’ils se sentent heureux. Notre musique ?  A la fois happy et travaillée. »  \r\nGageons que ce prometteur duo n’arrêtera pas de sitôt de faire parler de lui ou plutôt…de se faire entendre !",

It’s only since the beginning of 2011 that they decided to cooperate and form the duo now known as Flapjackers.\r\nInitially experimenting within the borders of the Funky House genre, they quickly expanded to Jackin, Tech and full-on Nu-Garage and the Deep House sound.\r\n\r\nHaving established a known name in the House scene as a whole, they released numerous singles, remixes and EP’s under their name, and established affiliations with many renowned labels including Greenhouse Recordings, Great Lakes Audio, Coyote Cuts, Native Soul, Central Music Recordings, and many more.\r\nThroughout their career they’ve received support from artists such as Mark Farina, Derrick Carter, DJ Sneak, Cricco Castelli, Jason Hodges, Tommy Largo, and many more.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t long before they started to organize their own events, which took place in the world famous club Café D’Anvers, located in Antwerp, with a concept called “Maison Mouvement”, inviting the top House DJ’s and producers from around the world.\r\nSoon they started touring throughout Europe, Including Croatia, Czech Republic, France and The Netherlands. They were also invited for the 2012 Winter Music Conference in Miami, appearing at various label nights and also at the Jim TV Poolparty hosted there that year.\r\n\r\nCurrently they are expecting their first vinyl release to be released in May 2013 on Mark Farina’s label Great Lakes Audio, which will be released as a limited edition blue vinyl, featuring their handpicked remix of Andrew Emil ft. Anonymous’ track “Mushroom Man”, which will be co-released with the new Mushroom Jazz album, of which the label’s affiliation and its manager Mark Farina is famous for.  Shortly before this they were listed amongst Mark Farina’s “Top 5 Producers”, which no doubt aided in their appearance on the label.\r\n\r\nSince their established position in the House scene they had the pleasure to share the decks with Ian Pooley, Gramophonedzie, Jason Hodges, Tommy Largo, Hector Moralez, DJ Mes and many more.\r\nWhenever playing, they are known for providing a dynamic mix of both old and new House and Deep House tracks, forever expanding their borders and always aimed towards the entertainment of the crowd, while staying loyal to the essence of the genres.",

A subtle warm-up and an unexpected prime-time is what Felix Cage seeks to share with the audience. The music awakens the senses and sounds turn into perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\nBorn in Paris, Felix grows up in Moscow. Classical music, Russian pop-rock of the early 90’s as well as the echos of the European house scene form his musical background. It is later in Belgium that Felix fully embracing the electronic music movement, the European clubbing culture broadens his musical horizons leading to DJing and later to production of music.\r\n\r\nTogether with friends from Brussels club scene Felix starts Borderline Corp. in 2009, a collective of DJs and producers who aim to promote non commercial music above usual FM standards played in clubs. Weekly parties and a radio show follow shortly, where Felix Cage gets to play with artists like Robert Babicz, Pole Folder and Guy J. Around the same time he demonstrates his production skills with a remix of Jaksa Pavicevic’s track, Groovin’ on A Must Have Records, followed by remix of Take Me Down produced by Timofey, Bartosz Brenes and Riya on Dirty Soul taking first position on label’s Beatport chart for several weeks. Not stopping there, Felix inaugurates a new Proton imprint, Abandon, with his Nightcrawler EP.\r\n\r\nAround the same moment he signs to a French-Belgian label Electronical Reeds. “Blizzard” produced together with his friend Mezza Luna, remixed by Pole Folder and Tokyo Black Star is the first major success early 2011 followed by a remix for Cristian Viviano. Solo EP “Mascarde” follows shortly, remixed by Rodriguez Jr. and Nhar, storming Beatport and WhatPeoplePlay Top 100.With guest appearances on Proton Radio, Frisky Artist of the Week Show, podcast for HMWL, monthly resident at Woodstrasse parties in Brussels as well as upcoming productions on Electronical Reeds, Felix Cage continues his path to become an established electronic music artist.",

  "artist_bio": "If one could describe in a few words what Garnomala stands for, it’s easy to comprehend: he doesn’t like to follow rules, therefore he does like to do things in a different way. His mind is 24/7 occupied with music: production, hardware, ideas… name it and he thinks about it.When he works in his studio, he doesn’t choose a specific direction, although his preference always goes back to deep and percussive house, altogether with an unique, interesting sound design. \r\nHis productions float around underground house, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t make other styles of music. \r\n“Playing live defines me as an artist”,  which means Garnomala is not really a DJ, but a performer. And getting better in this specific thing, is one of his objectives. Each year his performances expand, when integrating more and more hardware, with the involvement of complexer ways of playing, and as a real artist, he’s always on the lookout for new inspiration.\r\nWhat makes him different from other artists on the FloorFiller agency is that he founded his own label in 2012. Not a big deal in these times of digital revolution, but still a remarkable thing. The reason is pretty obvious: it gives him a chance to release his own material, and not only that, whenever he meets an artist that fits his label perfectly, they possibly could get a chance to release on his label too. Meeting other artists is just a part of his ever going journey as an artist.\r\n“My daily job doesn’t have anything to do with music – I’m not going to be detailed about it – but on the contrary, it serves me a lot of time to overthink some ideas.  And when doing my work, I’m listening to a radio station that plays 70’s and 80’s music. It’s kinda like a source for inspiration”\r\nThat being said, one needs to listen to Garnomala’s music to feel what he’s talking about. His constant feel for innovation could be an example for every other artist, no matter what style.",

Records, a leading dance record company in the benelux. Responsable for the vinyl distribution, he had first sight on all new releases and different genres, which was an important influence and impact on his career. Second to that he created two labels (Visitor Records & Dogtown Records), where he signed artists like Eddie Richards, Nathan Coles, Guy J, Nick Chacona & Daso.\r\nThis gave him the opportunity to play in foreign cities like Buenos Aires, Miami, Atlanta, Paris, London and Sarajevo.",

They produce under the name Furniture Crew and Moon And Baker. The two also maintain the Clean And Dirty Recordings label.Guy: It all started with Furniture Is music, back in 2005, when Guy Vercruysse and Denneb Vervaeke met for the first time, and quickly discovered their mutual love for music. They immediately began studio work together, and in 2006 they had their first two tracks signed to Paris Label, Da Traxx Records, and then New York, NY digital label Breakfast Recordings. In 2007 they signed a full album deal on Next Dimension music (Goodyear, Arizona), released tracks on the Kinjo music and Footwear labels. The beginning of a musical trip; their hard work has already taken them to several large live gigs in Belgium and abroad. Markt Rock in Leuven, La Scene Bastille in Paris and overseas to New York City to name a few. Furniture is Music is strongly influenced by Jazz, jackin', old school, tribal, soulful, funky, and deep house music. In 2009, Furniture had become a one man project. Guy kept on producing and in 2010 he got together with Floris Thissen.Flo: is a 30 year old guy from the city of Gent, Belgium. Growing up in a family where classical music was daily bread, he started playing the violin at the age of 4 and a few years later he began playing the piano. In the 90's he found his love for house music. Time passed by and he started to know more acceptable record labels like Ministry of Sound. Listening to 2 Step sound brought him more and more into that funky vibe. As the years passed \"learning\" the House sound, he decided to leave Belgium and went to Rotterdam (Netherlands), where he learned audio production and engineering at the Conservatory of Rotterdam. Today his music production is filled with great inspiration and positive karma, and he will most definitely continue doing this for quite some time to come...",

The sense techno was charted by lot of big names like Umek on his Time Warp Compilation Vol. 4 in 2003. After that Gerome worked on Suburban Knight Live act and album called \"Digital Warriors\" to perform with James and Sammy across Europe.\r\n \r\nIn 2004 after working with Sierra Sam on their label “Serie Records”, Gerome launched his own label, KRAX Records, and developed the mythic Chicago house sound which he loves to mix with electro and techno influences. It gives a certain freshness to Krax without denying the old school grove from the legendary TB-303. Acid Krax Vol. 2 became a huge success, especially with his own track “Growth”, charted by The Hacker, Miss Kittin, James Zabiela and Plastique de Rêve, just to name a few.\r\n \r\nThe times flies and Gerome got involved into more minimal and techno sounds. A good example of this evolution would be his EP, “Exchange 303 to 808”, released on Toys For Boys Records. This track has been played and charted by Paco Osuna, Bloody Mary, Tim Xavier… He also released lot of techno tracks on labels such as  Rekode Musik, Fassade Records... Always open-minded and curious about new sounds and technologies.\r\n \r\nIn the begening of 2013 Gerome was asked to  remix \"Dachshund\" and released some tracks on Caduceus Records, a new great Swiss label. End 2013 his love for vinyl records pushed him to start a new auto produced label project on limited vinyl records series wich is called “Sporty Limited”. For this first Sporty Limited release, Gerome comes out with three stylish tracks. The first track, A side “Drive”, is a fat house stomper with strong stabs and female voice hits. The break is intense and works effectively on packed dance floors. B1 is called “Free Range” and feels like summer. It’s full of classic house sounds, filtered strings and hypnotic loops. This is a Chicago-styled, disco sampled, deep and classy house track we love and cherish. The B2 track, “Don’t Go”, is composed with a classic house bass, shuffled 909 drums and dark space strings. You’ll immediately recognize the deep and melodic Detroit house sound.",

He was born on March 15 1986 in Brussels. Growing up with a father who was a real music addict and a record collector, he was always surrounded by music.\r\n\r\nAs a teenager Pablo was submerged in the massive party scene emerging from Belgium in the early to mid 90's. Completely absorbed by the impressive momentum surrounding him, he started buying his first tunes, looking for a balance between the tracks that were popular in the scene and the sounds he heard in his head. His immaculate capability of cherrypicking the best of the past and the creme de la creme of new cutting edge dancemusic made hime very quickly noticed in the Brussels underground scene.\r\n\r\nTotally fascinated by software technology and hardware machines, Pablo began to experiment compositions by fusing musical styles. Indeed, Pablo is constantly seeking to reinvent his sound and he loves to inject a bit of \"crazyness\" into his music, because the 'Minimal movement' in his eyes, is far too boring at times.\r\n\r\nLate last year Pablo got signed to Doctor Vinyl Recordings in Brussels, the recordlabel of mythical recordshop Doctor Vinyl. His tracks were so impressive that the immediate reaction on his tracks left a shockwave in the international scene. No use to give fake references when the feedback left by all is so \"out there\". Pablo is supported by: Mad Mike (UR), Luciano (Cadenza), Estroe (Connaisseur), Mugwump (R&s), Charles Webster, 2000 & one, Mason, Ivan Smagghe,...\r\n\r\nPablo is also working on a duo project called BAGARRE and have a solo 'AKA' JOHN BON GODASS!\r\n\r\nHe played @: MIRANO CONTINENTAL (BE) / DALI'S BAR (BE) / PIKNIK ELEKTRONIK (BE) / DOUCHA BAR (BE)/ CAVES DE LA CHAPELLE (BE) / WHITE NIGHT (bxl by light) (BE) / LE THEATRE NATIONAL (nuit blanche)(BE) / LE MARIGNAN (BE) / FUSE CLUB (BE) / THE WOOD (BE) / THE WAX CLUB (BE) / BRUSSELS 4 (BE) / LA BODEGA (BE) / LE MIXER BAR (FR) / LA SCENE BASTILLE (FR) / THE DOUBLE LUCKY (AU) / THE WOLFE LANE (AU) / KAMA SUTRA (BALI) / CLUB 88 (BALI) / DEJA VU CLUB (BALI) / ROSSO VIVO (BALI)...\r\n\r\nHe shared the decks with artists such as: KOLOMBO/DJEDJOTRONIC /NOOB/NÔZE/ MASSIMO DACOSTA/JEAN NIPON/BREAKBOT/SWEATSHOP/LORENZO OTTATI/DAVID KENO/MICKEY/LADY JANE/FADY ONE/SO'LEX/ to name a few...\r\n\r\nLABELS: Doctor Vinyl Rec. / Da-traxx Rec. / 17:44 Rec.",

After some musical exploring, he kickstarted the Purple Snow events together with Roscoe Deem, wich featured Progressive style line-ups with none other than Son Kite, Ticon and more. This also earned him a spot on the Chech-based label Tribal Vision. \r\nLater, in 2009 Jochem Peterson (A&R of Atmosphere Records) asked him to represent his label. Under his guidance Ishtar took his first steps inside a studio wich lead to the release of their \"Lingala\" track. More or less simultaneously he joined the Feestgedruis-collective where he was introduced to the deeper soundscapes. \r\nFrom there Ishtar's dj-career exploded wich enabled him to play abroad (Germany, Holland, Mexico, France, Croatia) and at some of Belgian's finest clubs such as Fuse, SILO, Decadance & Café d' Anvers.\r\nNext to dj'ing Ishtar has always organised his own events. Together with some of his best friends Ishtar founded the notorious \"Nu Festival\" (2010, 2011,2012), an open air event wich took place in the beginning of september. These days, next to some other projects, he's also hosting the Minimal / House stage at the infamous Tribes Gathering Festival. \r\nIshtar vouches for a deep & crispy tech-house sound with sturdy basslines and melodic synths. Don't miss out on this!",

Even techno music is a different version of house music, it's a little bit faster and more aggressive. I try to be somewhere in between techno and house, and the reality is that everything is based on house. I would say I'm a house DJ for sure. And all this click-house, and micro-house and bleep-house, it's only to sell better the product, you know? At the end, everything is obeying the rules of house - the breaks, the snaps, the snare-drums, the high-hats. Everything is absolutely house. You can substitute different sounds - instead of a normal high-hat, you can use a click or whatever, but it's all house.(R. Villalobos)\r\n(...)\r\nIgor was just a little lassie from Mons who grew up listening to Michael Jackson's Moonwalk, Bobby Brown's Two can Play that Game, KC & The Sunshine Band's Get Down Tonight and Warren G's Regulate. Once he reached his teens he discovered his passion for Electronic Music while listening to the sounds of Steve Rachmad, Richie Hawtin, Technasia, Dave Clarke, Funk D Void, Kenny Hawkes, MFF, Lance De Sardi, Brett Johnson, St Dic (RIP) Dj Sneak & Derrick Carter. His infatuation with sound of music pushed him to create the Wildfamily Parties which were uplifted by the house & techno of Jamie Jones, Clive Henry, Seth Troxler, Ryan Crosson, Shuan Reeves, Matthew Styles, Sammy Dee, Matt John, Tobi Neumann, Dinky, Pier Bucci, Los Updates as well as his dj friends.\r\nHe has been able to score with his unique sound, which only really seems to fit in the deepest and darkest of the belgian clubs and was also able to tour abroad with this notable sound and was invited to play alongside all the biggest names in his scene.….many claim his presence is now known in the disco beats of Belgian.\r\n\r\nIn 2011 he started a new project with Vernon Bara, Ultrasone was born. Almost instantly the duo started producing stellar tracks on Troxler, Reeves, Crosson & Curtiss famous Visionquest lab hittin Guy Gerber’s Supplement Facts, Jamie Jones’ Hot Creations with their bomb ep’ Breathe ‘n’ Pop’ and Audiofly’s Maison d’être meanwhile their remixes on Saved, Get Physical, Air London tjust to name a few were triggering strong reactions from the crowds.  \r\n\r\nTwo years later the Ultrasone project had been stopped but Igor is still alive with 2 new residencies in the best clubs of Beligum, Café d’Anvers and Fuse. It’s in this last one that he will start he’s brand new parties ‘STATE Of FLOW’. Studio wise, after remixing Archie Hamilton and Patrick Meiner on Genial and Alejandro Vivanco on Sound Architecture, we heard through the grapevine that in the near future he might be doing something on Jamies’s label again and on Anja Schneider’s Mobilee.",

In those bags: music for big systems in small basements. Gratts got into underground dance music in the late nineties and together with Kong he's the founder of 'ensemble'. Although the duo don't want to call ensemble a label, it does release slabs of delicious vinyl every now and then. The first release was Xosar's 'Retreat 2 Rapture' EP including a remix by Xan Xoda. The second one titled ‘Ended up at De Ambassade’ included original music by De Ambassade and Raw Sketches with remixes by Ben Sun and Sisterhood, with more to come very soon. After relocating to Berlin last year, he runs the Beyond The Clouds club nights there.\r\n\r\nThe 30 year old has been carrying his records to happy club and festival crowds across Belgium, Holland, UK and Germany week after week, taking pride in being one of Belgium’s best kept secrets. In 2012, he was nominated as \"Best Belgian DJ\" in the Belgian Red Bull Elektropedia Awards. Together with ensemble partner Kong, he curates the house section for the 22tracks website in Brussels. Being a member of the small but dedicated We Play House family also led to Gratts teaming up with San Soda to form the infamous Het Collect-Ief Deruyter / De Ambassade. \r\n\r\nIn the last few years, he made appearances in some of Europe’s finest spots including Tief (London), Trouw (Amsterdam), About Blank (Berlin), Studio 80 (Amsterdam), Planet Rose (Nijmegen), Fuse (Brussels) among many other places. In spring 2013 he travelled through Asia, Indonesia and Australia to dig for vinyl records, sharing his finds with local club crowds in Jakarta, Hong Kong, Bali, Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Auckland (NZ). He's had the honour of sharing the decks with djs like Pépé Bradock, Vakula, Levon Vincent, Steffi, Theo Parrish, Kink, Gerd Janson, Antal, Hunee, Eddie \"Flashin\" Fowlkes, Kenny Hawkes (RIP) and Tyree Cooper among others, as well as playing warmup slots for live gigs by the likes of Lindstrøm, dOP, Genius of Time, Matthew Dear or Apparat. Unfortunately, he doesn't like namedropping.",

From a young age he spent hours listening to his father's radio clock with a simple tape recorder to catch his beloved stereophonics tunes. Among those, \"Give It Up\" from The Goodmen hit him straight to the bones forever. From that track comes his dependence on more percussive and exotic rhythms such as the latin-house and other tribal vibes.",

And slowly took his place within the Dutch dance scene although he was always staying true to his own belief.

This year his main focus is on his sound again as he enjoys playing and the interaction with the audience is what he likes most and people can hear that. Blending records to different levels and always experimenting with the crowd. Expect a set from the heart of a motivated electronic music freak and Sound Architecture, Below Sealevel and Catwalk resident and international resident of club la Leria in Santiago de Chile.\r\n\r\n2007 saw the opening of his new homebase Catwalk club besides playing at wicked festivals and clubnights like Loveparade, Awakenings, Cocoon, Cadenza nights, Timewarp afterparties, ADE, Sonar and more..In 2008 Joachim did two South American tours featuring Sound Architecture nights in Santiago, Buenos Aires, Mendoza aswell as a Russian tour featuring dates in Moscow and St Petersburg.\r\n\r\nCurrently Joachim is working on his solo productions that will be soon released on acclaimed labels. Together with Ilker Soylu, Joachim also forms the producers duo Concolor. In March of 2009 the debut ep of Concolor - This used to be our playground - ppx006 on German imprint perplex recordings was released featuring a remix of master Jerome Sydenham. Following huge support from the likes of laurent Garnier, Luciano and Karotte and ratings in all charts. More releases are expected soon on labes such as Kaato, Sound Architecture + also a follow up remix ep on Perplex recordings. Joachim has also produced music together with long time friend Jay Samuel of which there first EP, Naked run in the jungle is set to be released mid 2009.\r\n\r\nAfter a small silence on the labelfront 2009 seems to be the year to make up for lost time cause his own label and imprints Sound Architecture Records and Music People is releasing like crazy at the moment featuring strong releases of talented new and acclaimed artists such as Alejandro Vivanco, Felipe Venegas, Cess, Ali Kuru, Dollkraut, Felipe Valenzuala, Concolor, Jeng Do, Philogresz and many others.\r\n\r\nSound Achitecture is now also available at all digital platforms and off course on our beloved vinyl with new distribution partner clone in Rotterdam..\r\n\r\nYou are the move you make..\r\n\r\nmyspace: myspace.com/djjoachim\r\nmyspace: myspace.com/concolormusic\r\nmyspace: myspace.com/perplexrecordings\r\nweb: www.soundarchitecture.nl\r\nweb: www.catwalkclub.eu\r\nlabel web: www.clone.nl\r\nlabel web: www.beatport.com\r\n\r\nbookings Netherlands: bookings@soundarchitecture.nl bookings International: jan@rocketsauce.com\r\n\r\nPerplex 006 - Concolor - This used to be our playground. \r\n\r\nArtists: Concolor - Jerome Sydenham (remix) \r\nTitle: This used to be our playground EP \r\nCat.: PPX006 \r\nLabel: Perplex Recordings \r\nFormat: Vinyl 12”, digital\r\nRelease date: 11. of March 2009 \r\nStyle: Techno / House\r\n\r\nThe reliable label Perplex consequently continues to idealize its style without of letting the assumption occur to permanently try to top itself. With Joachim & Philogresz a.k.a. “Concolor” from Rotterdam, Perplex is getting another fresh and impressive act on board to supply an incredible original track. The remixer needs no big introduction: Jerome Sydenham, Ibadan-labelmanager, ex-New-York and now Berlin-resident has been a living legend since the early 90ies. This combination makes Perplex #6 another double-a-side which does not only aim for the dancefloor but also gives a sweet musical foretaste of the coming summer.\r\n\r\n“This Used To Be Our Playground” is a musically colourful hymn which seems custom-tailored for Perplex. It amazes by an individual composition of fine-dosed synthetic and and warm analogue elements shaped with the finest sound-generators. This track should not be misunderstood as a track for the supposed “special moment”, but carefully used to be able to create such a moment at any time!\r\n\r\nJerome Sydenham applies his version with such a straight intensity that it appears abysmally deep even despite its short breaks. A dynamic techno-bullet stripped down to the basics! The kicking drumloops with sickle-sharp hihats and whipping snares hold the tension from the beginning to the end. Jerome Sydenham which has always been a great inspiration for Perplex-manager Charles Widmore and completes Perplex’ sixth release not economically but spiritually!\r\n\r\nSupport by: Luciano, Brothers..

  "artist_bio": "Gols was born and raised in Aalst, a city famous for its Unesco World Heritage Carnival. His love for music grew intense by discovering the Kozzmozz parties in Ghent. The solid grooves of Mr C, Eddie Richards, Mr G, Nathan Coles and many other artists, lead him to where he is today.Around the year 2000, he started collecting vinyl and with a little help from his father, bought his first mixer. Through his passion for music, love for vinyl and unwavering dedication to the craft, he was able to retrieve some residencies in clubs and parties in his home base.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 he started producing his own tracks with his friend Tom Dazing. Through these experiences and with a lot of studio time, steady bouncing releases were put together and new inspirations rose. By visiting parties abroad, he discovered new sounds by artists like Ricardo Villalobos, Audio Werner, Arpiar and many more…\r\n\r\nIn 2012, he joined the Sweet Trade crew and got an opportunity to share his music at Belgian’s finest clubs. After a while he decided to take a step back from his sweet trade family and take the time to reflect on his music.\r\n\r\nRecently he moved to Ghent, where he is building a studio and expanding his vast vinyl collection even more, to perfect his sound. Dedicated, driven and focused, he has a passion for making music with integrity and soul. His inspirations are drawn from his experiences and continuous influences from old house, trance, minimal and techno.\r\n\r\nAbove all, Gols likes to have a good time on the dancefloor as much as he likes to give the dancefloor a good time",

Whether he is playing in the backyard of a friend's house or in a club for hundreds of dancers, Jensen's sets are always invariably exhilarating and extraordinarily varied.Few decknicians in Belgium combine great technical skills with a genuine passion for different types of music. One man surely does: Jensen. The last fifteen years this man has stepped up to become a leading player in the field, as host and entrepreneur of several party concepts but foremost as deejay. Today, with a rapidly evolving electronic music scene, Jensen is still regarded as one of the country's most innovative artists. Faut le faire.\r\n\r\nOriginally coming from a little village at the coast Jensen grew up with a severe passion for hip-hop. Absorbing the burgeoning sounds of American rap he relocated to Ghent where he met the city's rich night life scene. There his obsession for music moved to sounds with a 4/4 beat. It was love at first listen. Jensen started to collect and spin records, heavy influenced by house legends like Ron Hardy and Mr. Fingers. Since then he encountered a lifelong need to build up a severe vinyl collection.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't long before Jensen started to collaborate with like-minded souls. First he teamed up with Bugsy for a long-lasting partnership. Their spinning sessions on four decks became legendary at the What's Cookin' soirees, a house concept both artists had set up together with JeanJack. As a result Jensen was asked to take up a residency at Decadance. This event not only marked the beginning of a ten year stay at Ghent's most notorious venue, it also established his position as one of the fastest rising artists in the scene. Since then Jensen fascinated audiences as a host and deejay of several exquisite house gatherings in the city.\r\n\r\nToday Jensen is active on various fronts. He is co-hosting the We Play House parties in Decadance, alongside label boss Red D. You can also find him at Baar, Ghent's most recent music hideout, where he regularly dishes up a cocktail of boogie, soul and funk. The little spare time that is left he is spending in the studio, where he is taking his first steps in producing.\r\n\r\nWhether he is playing in the backyard of a friend's house or in a club for hundreds of greedy dancers, Jensen's sets are always invariably exhilarating and extraordinarily varied. Touched by every piece of music, from funk and soul to house and techno, the man's record bag holds decades of dance music. It makes Jensen unique as a deejay and a person.",

  "artist_bio": "In a world of pop-star DJs, short shelf-lives and shorter attention spans, Jimmy Van M is that rare thing – a craftsman, willing to put in the time, energy and creativity to bring his audience something timeless and distinctive, whether he’s in the studio or performing live. With over 20 years experience, Jimmy has worked tirelessly to spread his sound across America and beyond, and to create unique opportunities for other artists to do the same.In a world of pop-star DJs, short shelf-lives and shorter attention spans, Jimmy Van M is that rare thing – a craftsman, willing to put in the time, energy and creativity to bring his audience something timeless and distinctive, whether he’s in the studio or performing live. With over 20 years experience, Jimmy has worked tirelessly to spread his sound across America and beyond, and to create unique opportunities for other artists to do the same.\r\n\r\nJimmy started DJing in the early nineties, honing his skills at the legendary house parties at his place in Orlando, Florida. These parties saw Jimmy playing alongside anyone and everyone from local friends showing up with a bag of records to the cream of the DJ talent passing through the city. 1996 saw Jimmy joining Sasha and John Digweed on the North American leg of their Northern Exposure tour, and from then until 2000 he was a resident at the world-renowned Twilo in New York, a club often credited with bringing underground house and techno back to the US. Another landmark came in 2002, when Jimmy took to the road with Sasha and Digweed once more, this time for the Delta Heavy tour. Delta Heavy saw the three DJs play 32 gigs in 8 weeks, taking their sound to corners of the States that had previously been neglected by the electronic scene, and laying the foundations for the explosion in popularity that electronic music has witnessed in the States over the past decade. Never one to rest on his laurels, Jimmy has continued to be involved in the biggest and best events in the world, including welcoming in the new millennium with 25000 party-goers in Melbourne, and performing at the first Creamfields Russia in Moscow in 2005 and at Creamfields Buenos Aires in 2009, which drew in an incredible crowd of 55000.\r\n\r\nAs a DJ, Jimmy has reached even wider audiences through his compilation albums. After bringing some much needed underground credibility to Ministry of Sound’s Trance Nation series with Taylor, Jimmy turned in the acclaimed sequel to Digweed’s first Bedrock mix album in 2001. Five years later he released one of the high points of the hugely respected Balance series, a triple cd showcasing his range as a DJ, and still widely regarded as one of the finest mix compilations ever made. 2012 saw Jimmy return to Bedrock, this time as one half of the Audible Suspects, teaming up with legend Oliver Lieb to again deliver something really special, the aptly named ‘Collaborations’.\r\n\r\nJimmy has also made his mark as a producer, with early tracks such as ‘Sanctuary’, ‘E.C.I. – P.S.’ and ‘Love Like Sleep’ featuring on compilations from Sasha, Digweed and Dave Seaman, and becoming firm fixtures in the progressive canon. Jimmy’s more recent work with vocalist Steve T saw him back in the boxes of the world’s finest DJs, ‘My Eyes’ receiving a massive three-part remix package on Proton and ‘We Are Children’ providing a highlight of both John Digweed’s Structures 2 album and Dave Seaman’s most recent Renaissance Masters Series. Despite this success, Jimmy felt like he needed to go back to basics in the studio, and so when he moved to Frankfurt to work on the ‘Collaborations’ album he also took the opportunity to spend a year learning production values from the master, Oliver Lieb.\r\n\r\nThe past year has seen Jimmy take the knowledge and skills he acquired in Frankfurt to the very heart of the recent musical explosion in South America, Buenos Aires. Living in Argentina has enabled Jimmy to bring something of his Delta Heavy concept to the country, letting him reach audiences in the smaller cities which, despite being all too often overlooked by big name DJs, are just as ready to party as their counterparts in better known destinations. Jimmy has also established his own studio in Buenos Aires, working with the Spanish producer Affkt’s mastering studio Pobla.es to make sure his ideas are fully realized. Recent tracks on RLS and RELEASE and collaborations with rising Argentinian star Adrian Hour have given us a hint of what’s in store. But with his creativity on overdrive, further collaborations with Affkt and with a number of upcoming Argentinian producers on the horizon, and his label Dirty Resonance launching in 2013, you’ll need to keep watching this space to see where Jimmy Van M takes us next.",

As a dancer he grew up in modern ballet, as an actor he comes from movement theatre, as son of a dj he feels at home in music’s history. His background is as different as it is one. Because in all domains, he finds movement in sound. As some would call it: through sound he tries to fit everything in the harmonic world. Gusano thinks sound.\r\nMusical harmony and nature’s harmony go often hand in hand. Therefore it is not astonishing that you will frequently find him walking in autumn forests, hiking through Scandinavia or running into a cold mountain lake.\r\nWith his music, he tries to balance on the verge of contradictions. How can I digitally sound analog? How can I arouse an organic nature feeling through electronica? How can I make my audience dance without any beat?\r\nPut such questions together with his broad background and you get the multi-talented artist he is. An ecclectic recordbag, trans-genre mixing, interaction with his audience and much more!\r\n",

He listened a lot to music on tapes and to the radio,and there came the love for house music. After a long period of nagging, he got the best birthday present at the age of 15, a music mixer and dubbeldeck cd player. Every free second of his time went to his devotion of music, looking for tricks of using the music that he loved. 2 years later, Jimmy got the chance to prove himself at a cool club in Antwerp, at the cool pace named 'Het Eilandje'. \r\nIt was his first time playing for an unknown public and yet he got a place to play there every Saturday as the resident dj. After that, he got interested in making his own music. With his savings, Jimmy bought his first pc with sound card and a Korg keyboard. After a few years, he discovered his own sound and at the beginning of 2004 he released his first record, Jim-Y: Digital Trumpets, at the label named after the famous club BBC Records. In the meantime he was working on a project with his best friend Ruly. Jimmy had finished a new demo where he thought the perfect voice would match with, Ruly and Jimmy (= R&Y) took the initiative with their own money to send the demo to there favorite singer. And guess what, 2 weeks later Jan Johnston contacted them. Jan had already written the lyrics and called for a date to do the recordings for this song, that's where R&Y meets Jan Johnston- It's cold outside, was born. This single was released in 2007 by Mostiko with remixes from Filterheadz,Sied van Riel,... In 2008 was Morning on the Terrace released by Bonzai Fiesta. \r\nAt the end of 2008, Ruly decided to stop with the project, and that's when Jim-Y changed into Jimmy Galle, because Jimmy's sound was different as a solo dj/producer. After this period, different productions and remixes appeared on different labels.\r\n\r\nJimmy is currently working at an own dj mix compilation, which will be released in 2010 under the Bonzai label. It can be purchased at all the large download portals such as i tunes, beatport, trackitdown,... There's also new material on the way for Bonzai, such as a remix for Yves De Ruyter Classic and a few tracks for Planet Scaldia.\r\n\r\nJimmy was also guest dj at clubs and events as Noxx, La Rocca, Café D' Anvers, Industria, Chakra Party, The Factory, Lazzurra, Club Legenz, Petrol, De Rodenburg (NL), TranceSession, Playboy Deluxe, De Cinema, Space, Wicked, BBC, De Kaai, Red & Blue, Turbulance..",

His first experience was in 1989 which involved listening to Acid, New Beat, House, Techno, Rave and visiting clubs all over Belgium and Holland. No wonder so many electronic noises worked their way up into his sub consciousness.\r\n\r\nBeside his DJ career, Jerry May is also a promising producer. Started with producing in 2010 he immediately caught the attention of many big producers who supported his releases, star producers like Len Faki, D-Formation, Paco Osuna, Reset Robot and Nick Chatelain to just name a few from a long list. With his releases on labels like Detone Music (UK), Monique Speciale (CA), Bonzai Records (BE), Beatfreak Rec. (ESP) And Sub Society (USA). Jerry May got pretty fast into airtime on the famous radio show Toolroom Knights, selected by Mark Knight. Also Roger Sanchez air timed he's track \"Gods creation\" on he's radio show \"Release Yourself\" and announced it as \"coming up next.. Jerry May and I'M LOVIN' THIS TRACK God's Creation“. His entourage comments “He’s definitely an upcoming dj/producer to look out for”. Even today he is caught in the music, since he lays his soul into the A&R of Pron Records the Label of Jerry May & Chris Hughes, one of the new upcoming labels. Together with the crew at Pron Records he seeks the right vibes and sounds for the label.\r\n\r\nOver the past two years Jerry May exploded over the club, festival and party scene. Noticed and pushed by Café d'Anvers club nights (Push It) , Jerry had the chance to exploit his unique style & sets to the people, and oh boy, he exploited himself like a real party killer. Heads and hands go up, yelling, whooping and bouncing is not unusual while Jerry is on the decks, which he shared with the cream of the earth: Carlo Lio, Reset Robot, Ellen Allien, Technasia, Darren Emerson, Butch, Kaiserdisco, Dyed Soundorom, Marco Carola, Mark Fanciulli and many more.\r\n\r\nMay’s biggest gigs include Tomorrowland, Laundry Day, Ostend Beach, Neverland and he’s a more then frequent dj at party’s who been held in the famous club Cafe d’Anvers.

Trying to distinguish themselves from other DJ's and producers by opening their mind for all possible influences, they are gently working their way up. Solid drums, repetitive basslines and catchy vocals are the main ingredients to the house-dish these guys are serving.\r\n\r\nDescribe them as the offspring of classic house DJ's and new generation of tech-house artists. Originating from Belgium, they keep conquering more and more hearts of music-lovers. \r\n\r\nAfter having released their debut EP \"Jeunes Hommes\" on MSMD, a whole lot of great parties and clubs lined up to book these new kids. Beats Of Love was an amazing highlight in the summer of 2010. Shortly after this great summer, filled with gigs and inspirational moments, the second Hector & Nate EP called \"Jomo\" was released on the infamous Australian Underground label Scatter Music. More and more new attention followed, which resulted in a couple of remix request, one of which by Bakehaus Records from New Zeeland.\r\n\r\nFor the summer of 2011, one can only expect next-level stuff from Hector & Nate. Their third EP \"Big City\" strikes in a completely new manner. Delivering adult tech house tracks and grooving DJ-sets, one can say Hector & Nate are ready for their next step. First gigs abroad are confirmed and with Laundry Day 2011 their first open-air festival is a fact as well. Get ready to dance and have fun.",

Playing as a resident afterclub-DJ only a few months later to performing on Tomorrowland’s stages proves her persistence.\r\n\r\nIris’ sets are inspiring explorations of tech-house and techno influenced by record labels such as Rekids, Dame Music, Rumors, Rebirth, Items & Things, Token, Trapez, K7 Recordings, Amam, Kompakt, Lazerslut, 1Trax, Dissonant, Ostgut Ton and many more. Time after time she succeeds in creating an atmosphere some adherents describe as “magical”.\r\n\r\nHer club DJ-history includes Café d’Anvers, Decadance, La Rocca and Krush Club to name a few. During her career she played alongside big DJ’s as Josh Wink, Technasia, Mark Fanciulli, Philip Bader, Olene Kadar, Tale Of Us, Fur Coat, Mark Henning, D’julz, MANIK live, Marcel Dettmann and Audiofly.\r\n\r\nSteadily her influence on the scene is expanding, in Belgium as well as internationally. Both in 2009 and 2011 she played at Tomorrowland allowing her to reach a broader audience. More recently Iris participated in a deep-techno project (part of Fireinthedisco – Amsterdam), bringing in a fresh vibe to modern day Techno and leading to more performances on Tomorrowland’s stages (2013 & 2014). Her success has led her to play at much appreciated gigs in Sicily, Milano (Italy), Geneva (Swiss) Germany, Turkey, France and Holland.\r\nSince 2015 she entered the Kunstgeschwister bookings agency family in Germany.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Iris is researching new musical possibilities, setting out the future’s framework so a continuation of her innovatory DJ-performances is a certainty.",

From the start Jem, like his friends now call him, never played music like others would have done. Totally rejecting calibrated music, he was playing Funk music from guys like George Clinton, Parliament Funkadelic, P-Funk All Stars when others were trying to gain success by playing commercial stuff. He was then only 13 years old.\r\n\r\nFollowing that Funky style, Jemaho gained his letters in 1989 by being one of the first in Belgium to play Chicago House Music in Belgium. He started then to take a step aside from the local radio, where he was then Program Director and took a residency in a Flemish Club called the “55” in honour of “Studio 54”. Like he used to say, the “55” was for House what “Studio 54” was for Disco. His residency lasts until the last day of the “55”, along with his mate Jan V. After that he played as a guest in many clubs like the “Catacombes” or the “Café D’Anvers”.\r\n\r\n1996 was the year he met Kalky when taking a residency in a little town. With him, Jemaho knew that House Music was alive. They played a lot together in many clubs but unfortunately House, and Deep House (what was for Jemaho his real true style) wasn’t hype anymore in Belgium. After a divorce, Jem almost retired from the Deep House scene until 5 years ago where he saw in Internet an opportunity to revive his Deep “almost mid-tempo” House style thru the Internet.",

After this perfect launch, he persevered with his production and 2012 was dawning when Inmotion Music released his track «Crapkin», which meant for him the first checkpoint in his career after receiving the feedback from the leading DJs in house & tech-house music world... «Crapkin» was selected and included in the Defected compilation and got remixed by Noir.\r\nHis encounters with Noir meant a right step in Ilario’s career. Noir proposed him to be part of the Noir Music Family. Inspired by Ilario’s sounds, Noir decided to create the Klimaks Records and offered Ilario to sign the first Klimaks EPs.\r\nIn 2013, as if it were part of a beautiful story tale, Carlo Lio for Rawthentic and Riva Starr for Snatch! gave Ilario Liburni the opportunity to express himself by means of his eclectic productions with one unique goal which was nothing else but reach the dance floor.\r\nIn 2014 many top records labels such as Kina Music, Memoria Recordings, Moan, etc... have been requesting Ilario’s talent and creativity which can only suggest that his career is now ready to take off and gain all the recognition that he truly deserves.",

At a certain point, a remix of Stromae – Alors on danse made it to a famous Belgian radio station Topradio. Other tracks were supported by Belgian deejays and played in some famous clubs like Verso, Noxx and Carré.\r\n\r\nDuring the last five years, Jackstraw gained success in Belgium with support from locals such as Dimitri Andreas and releases on Royal House Records, a Belgian label hosted by Wild & Dann, Bedroom Muzik (USA), Cubek Records (Colombia), Mood You Records (Argentina), Comfusion Records (Spain), and so on. \r\n\r\nJackstraw wants to take you on a trip to their world, a world full of massive tunes, amazing atmospheres and uplifting grooves.",

Traveling the world with his music :-)It all started in his youth days when he was a child at his fathers bar where he could play music during the weekend. So young but he knew that music was going to be important in his life. Playing at local clubs at later age made him feel great as the crowd was dancing on his music, that soon evolved into bigger clubs & festivals.??\r\nJoey always knew it was important to have a style and get his print at it. Thats why producing is a must to do for him as an artist, playing his own tracks for the crowd is an extra boost to give the people a solid set!\r\n\r\n??These days he released tracks at Atmosphere Records, Wired Records & Push it Records and awaits the confirmation of others to come. With his attractive percussion work and catchy drive he knows how to make the people shake with his tracks.??Joey already achieved some great things in a couple of years. 2010 was the year he got discovered by DJ Prinz with his record label Push it Records. Because of his great performances at the Push it party's he also got the chance to hook up with the pirates of Feestgedruis. These days he is proud to say that he is an official resident on a regular base of both.?\r\n\r\n2011 was also a year with some great achievements for Joey. He got to play at the biggest festivals and in the biggest clubs of belgium for massive crowds. By working hard every day to get his productions to a higher level he got in contact with Jochem of Atmosphere Records. At first things didn't look like there was going to happen something soon but because of hard work and a lot of improvements in no time Joey is proud to announce he is an official Atmosphere artist.\r\n\r\n?His gigs are already looking good at his age with sets at Tomorrowland, Studio 80 (Amsterdam), Café D'Anvers, La Rocca, Ockxfest Festival, Tribes Gathering, Laundry Day, Tour & Taxi Magic Mirrors, The Place (Ibiza), Decadance, Noxx, Pacha Belgium, Keta Loco Party's, Eargasm Open Air Festival, KetaLoco Concepts, Forest Festival, Cherry Moon, Extreme and many more...\r\n\r\n??This young artist is just enjoying his life with musical needs evolving every year.

He doesn't wait for the next thing to land on his lap, actively seeking it out - just take a peek at his playlists on Belgium's foremost national radio station Studio Brussel which received compliments from Rough Trade Shops and Gilles Peterson.\r\n\r\nHowever, don't assume that he's only working futuristic angles - no sir. Firmly rooted in jazz and hip hop, he sharpened his digging sensibility working at the now legendary Music Mania record store in hometown Brussels. His passion for jazz resulted in a remix album for Blue Note which was well received by the community. Lefto is forever moving forward but always has an ear in the past. Famed for his gloriously eclectic DJ sets, he switches effortlessly between hip hop, funk, breaks, neck-snapping beats, future bass, South-American influences, bruk riddims and some wild African rhythms. He's not only a deejay and producer but also curates his own stage at the Dour Festival and his own nights in Gent in collaboration with Democrazy.\r\n\r\nWorld renowned, LeFtO regularly blesses sound systems from Tokyo to Seoul and Singapore to New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. He has been a resident deejay for Gilles Peterson's Worldwide Festivals since 2008 around the world. Camera under the arm, he is also one of the few deejays on this planet who can deejay somewhere and have a nice movie on the internet a couple hours later, with over 250 videos on YouTube and Vimeo, it's very impressive. The travels resulted in the Worldwide Family Vol. 1 compilation on Gilles Peterson's Brownswood Recordings with partner in crime DJ Simbad in 2011.  In 2012, he has put out two compilations, one for American brand 101Apparel and the other one for Universal Music.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lefto.be\r\nhttp://www.mixcloud.com/leftooo\r\n",

To deliver quality house music through his productions and DJ sets around the world. He is a perfectionist who will happily delay the release of one of his own records if the bass needs tweaking or the vocals aren’t sitting perfectly in the mix once he has road-tested the track on one of the many quality sound systems around the world on which he plays.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nKid Crème aka Nicolas Scaravilli was born in Brussels in 1974 and when the globetrotting is done he still calls Belgium home. Nico formative teenage years were spent learning to spin Hip-Hop and studying music theory & classic piano. Unfortunately expelled from music college in 1991, he decided to set up his own home studio inspired mainly by the London hardcore break beat scene.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn 1994, DTM Recordz was born, a label collaboration between Nico, his brother and an old friend. The DTM crew released underground techno records catching the eye of the legendary R&S records who quickly offered them a label deal.\r\n\r\nBelgian label PIAS saw what was happening and offered him a deal for his techno productions. He accepted the offer and started recording for them under the name Sharpside.\r\n\r\nTheir second release 'Critical Freaks' crossed the techno / house divide and quickly gained support from such varied DJ’s as Dave Angel, Pete Tong , Carl Cox and Judge Jules. With Danny Tenaglia supporting track 'Belgian Resistance', Luke Slater using track ' Telsco Drop' on his album and 'Space Cruising' getting signed to Dave Angel's label, Nico's techno productions were going from strength to strength.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn 2001, kid Crème was born with Nico blending the tougher sound of his Sharpside productions with some seriously funky house sensibilities on 'Austin's Groove'. Austins Groove was signed to Subliminal with Eric Morillo adding a Shawnee Taylor vocal on the record. The track got some serious legs when Fatboy Slim dropped it in his now legendary Big Beach Boutique set on Brighton Beach. Around this time his DJ career with Junior Jack really started to take off with Rulin’ at Ministry offering them a residency that lasted 2 years. Classic releases like Hypnotising, Down & Under, Doing My Own Thing and The Game dropped across a mix of major labels and his own illegal Beats imprint. Remixes like his timeless version of Shakedown’s At Night meant that though rare, a new Kid Crème production was always something to take notice of.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThoughout the noughties Kid Crème & Junior Jack toured together – playing the world’s best clubs and festivals and holding down a residency for Defected at their Ibiza Club Nights from 2001 to 2012 spanning El Divino, Pacha & Ushuaia.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2015 saw Kid Crème start to tour as a solo artist as well as dropping new material on Suara (Austin’s Groove 2015) and Positiva (Look For Me) as well as making public a string of his most killer edits including his take on Rodriguez’s Sugarman and Adeva’s In and out of my life.",

  "artist_bio": "Acclaimed producer and DJ Vito Lucente has been releasing records under many different names but his best known moniker is without a doubt Junior Jack. Acclaimed producer and DJ Vito Lucente has been releasing records under many different names but his best known moniker is without a doubt Junior Jack. \r\n\r\nDespite his extensive work as a producer and re-mixer, 'Trust It' is Junior Jacks' hotly anticipated debut full-length release. It will hit the market in September 2003 and is promising to set another standard in the history of dance music. \r\n\r\nVito caught the house music virus in the early 90's and soon started to record tracks under different names including Kafé ('Can You See It'), Hugh K ('Shine On') and Mr. Jack ('Only House Music'). \r\n\r\nAround the same time he launched his own label Noisetraxx to which DJ's and producers like Roger Sanchez, Mouse T, Erick Morillo and Robbie Rivera contributed their remixing skills \r\n\r\nHis first recorded success under the name of Junior Jack was with the single \"My Feeling\" on PIAS recordings in 2000 which entered all the national charts in Europe, the US and Australia. It was also the first time a Benelux based producer reached the top spot of the European dance charts. \r\n\r\nJunior Jack's next release proved to be a milestone in his career. \"Thrill Me' was released in February 2002 and showed Vito's commitment to the underground house sound at a time when his remixes and production skills were already much in demand by increasingly successful clients. \r\n\r\n'Thrill Me' was a huge club hit that was immediately picked up by many top DJs who made it a dancefloor anthem across the world. With this track he firmly established the distinctive sound of the irresistible pumping bassline that has become one of his trademark. \r\n\r\nThe name Junior Jack quickly rose to fame on the dance scene and with it came more request on remixes for artists including Bob Sinclair, Moby and ATFC. His DJ schedule also remained very busy, playing regular slots at all the superclubs around the world including a residency at the Ministry Of Sound, teaming up with Kid Creme. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime Vito's restless creative output under different monikers did not slow down throughout this busiest period in his career. His signature continued to appear on many successful dancetracks. \r\n\r\nMost recently, Vito topped the UK singles chart with 'Make Luv' released under the name Room 5 on his own label Noisetraxx. The single, which was released in March 2003, kept the no. 1 position for 4 weeks making one of the most successful dance track ever in the UK. In Europe, 'Make Luv' held on to its top rank of the European dance charts for an incredible 6 weeks in a row. The track went on to sell a grand total of 500.000 copies worldwide \r\n\r\nBut whilst 'Make Luv' is still continuing to dominate local airplay and dance charts, Junior Jack is already creating dancefloor frenzy with his new single 'E Samba' which is currently taking the clubscene by storm. \r\n\r\nThis has only fired up the anticipation for Junior Jack's debut album. Can he live up to the high expectations that have been created with 'Thrill Me' and 'E Samba'? The album title should put those concerned at ease; 'TRUST IT!",

They play a wide variety of styles; from Cosmic & Balearic tracks, Italo &Boogie stuff, Chicago-House, Acid & New Beat, Detroit Techno and Deep & Tech-House.\r\nPlayed already on the biggest dj-event in Belgium 10 Days off and in various clubs & bars in Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent, Leuven & Mechelen.\r\nIt all started in the summer of 2006 when Peter & Adriaan bought their first turntables & mixer. Their musical backgrounds were completely different: Adriaan was a classically trained pianist, and also a fanatical jazz listener, while Peter rather hanged out in the Trash Metal and the Hardcore scene. \r\n\r\nUntil 2008 they weren’t more than 2 bedroom dj’s who played a few times on small private parties but they decided to team-up. Since then things are going fast! In May 2008 Peter was selected for the pioneer pro dj contest and Adriaan gained himself a spot at Café Capital by being one of the winners of a mixtape contest of Silenced in collaboration with the Belgian national radio station Studio Brussel. \r\nIn February 2009 they decided to change their DJ-name and they became: KING & COUSIN. \r\nIn the meantime they played a lot in Leuven (STUKcafé, Rumba, Musicafé, Machine) but also at 10 Days Off (Ghent), Café Capital & Camping Zuid (Antwerp), Hotel Bloom (Brussel) and many other venues.. \r\nOne of their mixtapes was even broadcasted on Pure FM in Cosy Mozzy’s radioshow ‘Dirty File’ They recently started their own blog called 'Swingers Blog' and later on this year they'll start with their own party concept in Leuven called 'Swingers Club' \r\n\r\nThey both are vinyl collectors and in those 3 years they managed to get a lot of old school rarities and fresh 80’s records. Their dj-sets are a blend of 80’s synthpop, italodisco, cosmic balearic beats, chicago house, new disco & electro tunes and even melodic Detroit techno & soulful deep house. \r\n\r\nTheir objectives are very clear, they just want to play their favourite tunes as much as possible and everywhere they can. Don’t expect noisy rave records or a set full of mash-ups but an original dj-set with vinyl records!\r\n",

Because of their common love for house & techno things went quickly well between these two Wetteren-based lads. By earning some experience thanks to their mentors and co-founders of OPUS, Colsen&Bates and their own Kot-events they we’re able to grow slowly to a firm duo with lots of potential. Their main goal: \r\n\r\nGiving people the opportunity to go bananas by bringing a cocktail to their ears composed of catchy Tech-House & banging Techno from all over the world.

  "artist_bio": "Having seen every quality club in Belgium at age 17 and even working at trend setting clubs Make-Up and Culture Club in her home city of Ghent, Leesa caught the deejay bug and developed a sharp sense for the better electronic music. With a 9-year-music education she managed to mix and match music perfectly. Prancing between minimal and tech house, her aim is to bring quality tunes to appreciative crowds.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the very start of her carreer, she won the vi.be DJ contest, winning her a spot opening for Monica Electronica. Later on also winning the Freevibes contest of leading Antwerp club Cafe d'Anvers it was clear that she had the talent to move crowds. Some of the other clubs and gigs she played up until now include Tijuana, Suite16, Trancefusion, Decadance and many more well known Belgian venues. Some of the names she's shared the stage with include Butch, Ida Engberg, Dave Spoon, Jesse Rose, Maxim Lany, Ed & Kim, Starski & Tonic, .... The list is ever expanding as Leesa continues to win over hearts and minds alike.\r\n\r\nHer first EP called 'Dinosaur' has been released in March and a second is on the way! 'Au Revoir Mon Coeur' will be released by the end of June.",

In the late 90's, he got into Chicago house and listened to djs such as David Morales from New York and Carl Cox from UK. He later discovered the \"Sound Of Detroit\" through the cult anthem \"The Aztec Mystic - Knights Of The Jaguar”, produced by Dj Rolando. A child of house music from the ninghties, Yannick owns a large collection of music whose driving force is a constant search for original sounds. His first work came to life in 2000 inspired by video games, and 2 years later he started working on Reason with his cousin during a holiday in the south of France. \r\n\r\nIn 2009 in Geneva, he launched his first professional musical project, the Teknologik label, with his long-time friends Romano & Vincent. When he then moved to Brussels in 2011, Yannick set up his own label BlackWallRecord with his friend Fabrice Wilkin with an aim to develop the local techno scene. It was around that time that 'Klengmann' the producer first entered the scene, and started sharing his own productions. In 2012 he produced his first album \"Like A Puff Of Air\" as well as several remixes on Teknologik and BlackWallRecord. \r\n\r\nKlengmann’s music takes from a wide array of techno genres from dark or melancholic to happy, while some are more straightforward minimal dancefloor tracks with a groovy bass and traditional beats. In 2014 Klengmann will embark on a new suite of projects with the signing of an EP on De-Generation in Italy, and a remix on Perception Corp in Brazil.\"",

His immaculate capability of cherrypicking the best of the past and the creme de la creme of new cutting edge dancemusic made him quickly noticed in the Brussels underground scene. Besides djiing and music production, he’s also co-organizing the EarlyLate parties and radio shows on FM Brussel.",

For Joris, mixing at home was the only way for him to express this passion because of his full time football career. Stijn had been spinning vinyl since he was 14 and had already played at several bigger local parties. However, they never found the statisfaction they needed: they wanted something more! Due to a lack of good parties in the city of Bilzen, they decided to take matters into their own hands. Together with 3 other friends they invented a concept with free minimal, house and tech-house music for everyone: \"Rejekted Rave\". These infamous parties at JH de Haajf were a big success, getting the house packed with party people every single time! Stijn & Joris's common taste and style developed into the habit of teaming up for back2back-sets from time to time. It was there and then Joyhauser was born, it just didn't have a name yet! Several succesful bookings and months later they decided to make it official: as from that moment on they would be known as Joyhauser. They introduced their name for the first time just before their third edition of Upside Down in March 2011 , a concept Joyhauser hosts together with the guys from Spearman Rho, combining house and tech-house in 1 venue divided into 2 rooms; where names like Massimo Dacosta, Raoul Belmans, Cashmere, Jensen, Deltano, Bollen & Fitchner and many more passed on the decks. Thanks to the lovely ladies of Dia Y Noche they also acquired a residential spot at Il Cavo (Maastricht) where they burn down that crazy basement every single month! No doubt 2012 is going to be a killer year, starting with bookings at CafÃ© d'Anvers, Decadance, CloudNine, C-Sick,.. Alongside dj's like Shinedoe, Egbert, Hermanez, Massimo Girardi, Seba Lecompte, Iris Menza, Eduardo Rivas, Michael Thoelen, Djens & Djunkbox, PlayMoreNoise,.. And there is many many more to come!",

Although too young to go out to clubs, Kevin discovered music such as 'House party' and bands as Channel X, Praga Khan and Neon. Later on, he followed the music as a teenager through programs such as Party Zone on MTV, showing music of FSOL, the Prodigy, Messiah,... So back in 1994, he knew that this would become his life. At the age of 14, he bought his first vinyl record with 'lunch money', given by his parents :-). So instead of food, he just bought records, in that time more Rave orientated sounds. After a search for his musical identity, the switch came when he first heard Sasha and Digweeds 'Northern Exposure' album. From that time on, he became more progressive orientated. In the year 1999, Kevin started learning by himself how to make music, using Reason 1.0. Bit by bit, his studio came to life, and so did his know-how. Nowadays, he creates different kinds of tunes, going from ambient, over electro and progressive, to more groove and house orientated sounds. The future looks bright, let's follow it!\r\n\r\n",

The sudden presence of this new organism changed the life of ‘Polderman’, the local disc jockey of the small community. Polderman brought this fresh shaped life form to his sober shed and gave him the name ‘KooDoo’. It was the beginning of a prosperous collaboration.\r\n\r\nAs he steadily grew, KooDoo got ravished by Polderman’s ancestral love for ‘music’. Day by day, tons of sound colours gently trickled in his brains. As a result KooDoo got inspired by Polderman’s heroes -Neil Young, Bob Dylan and Tom Waits- and by his hobby, being an old fashioned disc jockey at local festivities. These events unintentionally pushed him to follow the same direction.\r\n\r\nSo to say, swankly done. Nearly a grown up, the idiosyncratic creature took up the musical luggage and left the lost hamlet of Watervliet. Destination: the outside world, dominated by dangerous fauna like legislators, registrars, conservatives, priests and other gabblejackers. There he immediately fell in love with electronic music, the music of his generation and a powerful weapon to flee from this annoying fauna. \r\n\r\nIt didn’t take long before KooDoo, together with other common species, started to spread out flourishing dance tunes. First, as an entrepreneur with concepts like ‘Putzen’ (2010, Decadance, Ghent)  and Tuupe (2013, Ghent). Then also as a deejay, at clubs like Café d'Anvers or festivals like Extrema Outdoor. Today KooDoo is a proud member of Moodfamily, the music collective of Amyn and Beazar, where he sets out the musical guidelines as a A&R-collaborator. \r\n\r\nWhether KooDoo serves you a party or a deejayset, his constant aim is to provide you refreshing dance tunes, perfectly suitable for boobiebuffets, nightly cartrips through desolate Communist landscapes or gatherings space ships fuelled with gin. Beside that KooDoo also enjoys peeled kiwi’s, Jean's spaghetti's, people talking cockney English and morning on a Sunday evening.",

Over the last 8 years he's been contributing as the co-organiser of Feiern, one of the most authentic house parties in town, or as part of the Sunday Matinee collective that basicly layed the foundation for a now very vibrant open air scene within the city.\r\n\r\nHe started out as a young clubber with an almost unhealthy interest in the music that was being played, u could usually find him in front of the dj booth capturing the dj's hands every movement, and after discovering how things went down in Berlin in the mid- 2000s he realised that his love for electronic music was a lasting thing and bought his first turntables.\r\n\r\nBeing inspired by the Perlon-esque sounds of Berlin aswell as the international artists visiting his country he created a sound that combines these different influences, resulting in deep and strongly dancefloor-orientated dj sets that are filled with lots of variation, passion and energy. \r\n\r\nBecause of his strong connection to the community over the years it didnt take long until his reputation soon started to stretch beyond Antwerp and while inviting legends such as Move D, Mike Huckaby and Jus-Ed to his own parties he's been invited to accompany some of the biggest names in the industry such as Ricardo Villalobos, Laurent garnier & many others. All this while playing for some of the most respected clubs and concepts all over the country including the legendary Fuse club, Opus,Warm, Lucid, Abstrakt, Sound Architecture, Roots of minimal and even further the Goldengate club in Berlin or the Chicago social club in Amsterdam. \r\n\r\nRecently he started a new chapter by joining the resident team of the freshly opened Ampere club in Antwerp. A true underground venue (its located underneath the railroads) that uses sustainable energy to power an overwhelming soundsystem.",

He started his late night adventures in the middle of the 90's always trying to deepen his musical knowledge. A great fan of Warp, Rephlex, Ninja Tune, Sub Rosa, Hymen, Ant-Zen, Mego, Worm Interface and Skam.\r\n\r\nAlways found playing with his friends vinyls over the years growing up and when he had the chance around 2005 he got turntables of his own and decided to intensify his practice, in no time at all he started to broadcast his own mixes. In 2009 he joined forces with his friends at Maldita Rec and since then has performed at many Maldita parties and festivals in Belgium and elsewhere as well as a festival in Croatia in 2011 to great review. He has also taken part in many radio programs including shows from Belgium, Greece and the U.K and\r\nin 2012 he was invited to join the British label \"Structural Damage\".\r\n\r\nKrasius likes to mix different styles from electronica music including idm, industrial, drill, breakcore, acid and many more and also likes to realize ambient mixes with 3 or 4 turntables. Mixing music, field recordings, film samples and many other sound sources and using 2 other turntables with Scratch pro to spice his sets with many other ideas.\r\n\r\n*Since 2013 i started to work on my own stuff.\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "www.marcobailey.comIt all starts with a beat. A virtuoso of any craft starts with a love in their heart and a belief that this is their path. Great talents make their mark on the world by perseverance, struggle and dogged determination- traits few can withstand for very long these days. But sometimes a character of substance emerges, someone whose passion and talent truly rise above the norm, someone that embodies this music like no other can, a man who champions techno like a religion, and someone that the electronic music world can admire and take pride in.\r\nMarco Bailey is truly an icon in dance music. He cemented this status through relentless touring and with releases across a wide variety of respected labels such as: Drumcode, Intec, Sleaze etc to name a few.  After his critically acclaimed \"Dragon Man\" LP on John Digweed’s Bedrock label in 2011, Marco released the notable \"Stella EP\" (Intec) followed by \"Jungle Laps\" (Bedrock) in 2012. Esteemed artists such as Adam Beyer, Joseph Capriati, Gregor Tresher, Speedy J, Nic Fanciulli, The Advent, Pig & Dan, Christian Smith, Dave Angel, Ken Ishii and Sian all remixed Marco, always citing the fact that they are honored to work with someone they so admire and respect.  \r\nMarco’s certainly not just releasing on other artists’ labels. His own imprint, MB Elektronics saw him churn out no less than five separate EPs in 2012 alone. This was followed up by what some techno aficionados have dubbed a masterpiece, his 12 track album “High Volume” which dropped in 2013 along with his very up close and personal documentary “Marco Bailey.” Just born is also his new imprint MBR limited as well, a special limited series editions of total 20 EP's, all showing the deeper, dark and pureness of the Techno Sound of Marco Bailey. Each time with on the flip side a brilliant Remix such as guys like Black Asteroid from New York City, Flug from Argentina, Berlin based legends like Mike Dehnert & Korova.\r\nMarco is a festival fixture at some of the most prestigious shows in the world such as Tomorrowland (BE), Time Warp (Mannheim Germany), Awakenings (NL), Dance Valley (NL), Burning Man (USA), I Love Techno (BE), Nature One (DE), Global Gathering (UK), Ultra Music Festival (USA), Wire (JP), and Monegros (SP). On the clubbing side, he is a lauded techno ambassador at venues like Output (NYC), Zouk (SG), Ageha (JP), Fabric (London), Fabrik (Madrid), Lehmann (Germany), Rex (Paris), Industrial Copera (ES), and Chinese Laundry (AU) and with his annual guest appearances at Carl Cox’s \"Revolution\" events at Space in Ibiza, Marco has affirmed his legend and well-earned place at the top.\r\nMarco continues to adapt and challenge the status quo each week with his radio program Electronic Force which is heard by millions of listeners in more than 50 countries. This, coupled with his innovative production genius, passport filling tour routine, and never ending love and energy for techno culture makes Marco Bailey one of our truest icons.",

Belgian producer Locked Groove is one such deacon of dance music’s next generation; swiftly appropriating and innovating his way through the historical annals of techno and house with true flair and club-ready conviction. \r\nWhether flirting with big room, one-strobe-light Berghain techno or visceral deep house – Locked Groove’s rambunctious take on soulful rhythm is wholly unique and versatile. What’s most surprising is that it was only in early 2011 that this 24 year old producer found himself starting to develop his own explosive hybrid of industrial techno and melancholic deep house with rapid pace. \r\nScouted by Scuba for the inclusion of ‘Drowning’ on his recent contribution to the DJ Kick’s series and releases on Hotflush Recordings, Locked Groove has quietly but confidently begun weaving his way into the collective consciousness. This growing anticipation has also seen Locked Groove sign onboard with Tiga’s label, Turbo Recordings. \r\n2013 is bound to be the year where he will gain even more following and recognition. \r\n",

  "artist_bio": "The irresisible force of Michael Forzza as a dj/producer has to be his originality.The irresisible force of Michael Forzza as a dj/producer has to be his originality. The track Exposure for instance embodies his personal view of how a monotonous track can rock and move a large crowd. Originaly released in 2003 on his own Perimeter label, the record is still played by the biggest names around.\r\n\r\n\r\nAllthough he doesn't like to be pinpointed, his sound can be situated somewhere between minimal and techno. After several releases on his own label on wich he explores the darker section of his mind, Michael proved with Kahana that his sound can reach much further than that.\r\n\r\n\r\nElectrosphere, Monotone Eclectic and Exposure had that typical dark and dynamic colour on witch Michael has a patent while Kahana is filled with pure emotion and evokes that unresistable feeling of love. Just because of that unique combination Kahana became a dancefloor bomb and is still hammered at every big event or club worldwide. It was also voted as one of 2005 best sold records.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther labels started to aknowledge his work and signing two tracks on Len Faki's Figure was the next step! Tenor and the monkey and high on this knocked on doors everywhere and were played all over the globe. On his own label, he releases his Abstractor series. Part 1, 2 and Part 3 are already classics for those who love abstract, atmospheric techno",

  "artist_bio": "Hi, I am Marius, DJ and producer from Antwerp, Belgium.\r\n\r\nI have releases on Vizual Records, Wally's Groove World, Big Mama, Manuscript, JIVE, Foreplay, Eighttrack, Felinephonix, ...\r\n\r\nMy DJ sets are groovy, driving and melodic.\r\n\r\nMy music style is house music, deep, melodic.Marius is a dance music producer from Antwerp, born in the winter of 1974. After he had a few years of classical piano education, he started making his own compositions on his first synthesizer in 1989.\r\nInspired by the funky grooves from Babyface, Bobby Brown, Teddy Riley, Quincy Jones, Keith Sweat and Chaka Khan he became a fan of black music and danced to the hiphop of the early 90ies such as De La Soul, Tribe Called Quest, Dr Dre, Queen Latifah, Naughty by Nature and Cypress Hill.\r\n\r\nIn 1992 he got caught by the uplifting and mysterious vibes of the underground house music scene in Belgium. The key to this love were radio shows like \"Liaisons Dangereuses\" hosted by Sven Van Hees and \"Rave Radio\" hosted by Adam Curry. His favourite club was Café d'Anvers.\r\n\r\nMarius was producing music in his bedroom until 1994. Then he got in touch with the Mixz productions, who scored a major dance hit with BB Jerome and the Bang gang. Together they produced various dance productions and remixes.\r\n\r\nIn 1997 Marius studied at the national filmschool in Brussels. It was also in this year that he started buying vinyl and spinning the weels of steel. \r\nNow he started to release his productions and remixes for labels such as Sony Music, ARS, Zomba, Universal, Warner and Wally's Groove World. He made remixes for artists like An Pierlé, Wizards of Ooze, Groove Armada, Sessomato and collaborates with a whole bunch of people from the Belgian scene such as DJ Koenie (WGW-owner), Geoffroy from Food club (hi-Phen) and Rubba J.\r\n\r\nHis two releases on WGW \"Plainsim EP\" and \"Fresh and forward EP\" have been remixed by Freaks (aka Luke Solomon and Justin Harris) and played by veterans like Mateo & Matos. His two side projects are \"Deep Water\" together with bass player Rubba J and \"Mayaku\"\u001d a collective with Koenie and Rubba J.\r\nAfter more than 2 years of continuously bringing the deep flavoured house goodies on vinyl, Marius presented his debut album \"Balance\" on Wally's Groove World in the summer of 2000. In this year he also graduated as sound engineer.\r\n\r\nThe release of the Mayaku album \"On the other side of the Volcano\" followed in the summer of 2002. This is a mixture of deephouse, progressive and percussive techy tracks.\r\n\r\nSince 2003, Mayaku also performs live on stage in various clubs and festivals such as 10 days of techno, Dour festival, Arezzo festival, Café d'Anvers and lately even in Kiev (Ukraïne). For these gigs Mayaku is reinforced with percussion player Nico Lombardo (LUM recordings).\r\n\r\nMarius spins the decks at Café d'Anvers (Free Vibes, Never Say Never) , Silo (Food), Fuse and on private parties (Cruisin Beats, Senotorik, ...).\r\n\r\nHis musical taste varies from labels such as Seasons Recordings over MAW, compost, Drop Music, 2020 Vision, MFFR, Guidance, Wave Music, Grayhound, Dessous, ...\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "His style of DJing is very similar to the music he makes, techy-edged on a progressive trance tip. M.I.K.E is at the forefront of Europe's new sound...For some artists, a song title is a mere formality. For M.I.K.E., it's the beginning of a story, and indicative of an event or life experience that compels you to listenand find out more. M.I.K.E.'s own story started aged 10, after a Depeche Mode synth electro performance wowed him into wanting to produce music; he went on to release his first track at 18 and never looked back. Following 6 album releases under various guises (including Push and Plastic Boy), dance and chart success all over the world, and remixes for everybody from Sinead ‘O Connor to Moby over the Bloodhound Gang. \r\n\r\nM.I.K.E's reputation shot through the roof, and although a commercial crossover had never been anticipated, in 1998 'Universal Nation' took the world by storm, winning several dance awards, and undoubtedly being recognized as one of theclassic dance-records of the trance era till this day. Pole positions in worldwide dance charts were soon putting the Belgian dance scene firmly on the map. His Push follow-up single, 'Strange World', destroyed hundreds of clubs across Europe, in the same vein as 'Universal Nation'. This kind of success did not go unnoticed as M.I.K.E. was asked to DJ at some of thebest venues in the world; some of these include: 'Gatecrasher' and 'Godskitchen' in the UK,'Fura' and 'Vel Farre' in Japan, 'Dance Valley' and 'Trance Energy' in Holland, Spirit and Spundae in the U.S., from Australia's Sydney and Melbourne to New Zeeland and the residency in Armada' s Amnesia club night in Ibiza are a few to mention. Mike still holds residencies in The Gallery in London and Illusion / Belgium for his label nights.\r\n\r\nIn 1999 he decided to start-up his own label,and Scanner-Records was born.The music stands for minimal electric dance with a proggy touch. Scanner was renamed into Scanner Digital, as it welcomes the new digital era. All info can be found on www.scannerdigital.com.\r\n\r\nBut Mike is more concentrating on his new label Club Elite / Armada Music,where he releases his own productions under different guises The label boost tech house grooves and the better electro-trance.\r\nMore info can be found on www.club-elite-recordings.com.",

Dominique Heyninck aka 'Madloch' discovered house music in the early 90s; his passion for this new sound developed quickly, he collected tapes from his favourite DJs and eventually began purchasing vinyl in 1997. After months spent honing his mixing skills Dominique soon started getting gigs at some of the local events and was eventually offered residencies at various local clubs. As the 90's drew to a close Dominique was deeply impassioned with electronic music more than ever and with a hunger to push his sound to a broader audience he began to get gigs all over Belgium, Holland, Germany, Spain, Greece and Austria.\r\n\r\nAfter DJing relentlessly for many years the thirst for something new led Dominique to start exploring music production. A pivotal moment came in 2010 when Dominique along with close friend Dimitri Chantzis formed the production duo 'Mitrinique'. The duo was quickly burst into the electronic music spotlight when their first single entitled 'Saturday' earned support from international DJ Hernan Cattaneo. The then unreleased Eelke Kleijn remix of 'Saturday' was played by Hernan in his live sets for many months and was also featured in one of Hernan's highly influential monthly charts.\r\n\r\nIn the Summer of 2011 Dominique and Dimitri established their first label imprint together with Christophe & Erik from Yunta entitled 'Sound Avenue'. The label had five releases that year which included the likes of Deepfunk, dPen, Martin Garcia, Nikko.Z, Luis Bondio, Sound Process, Simon Firth, Soulfire, Liz Cirelli, Andy Arias, Overtone Watson and of course Mitrinique. The final quarter of 2011 saw the label quickly grow into one of the most hyped new imprints of the year. Although only five releases into their catalog by year's end Sound Avenue had already achieved the illustrious #1 position in Release Promo's overall Hype Charts several times and had secured several Beatport features which are reserved for only the most in demand and sought after releases of the moment.\r\nThe launch of the Sound Avenue label imprint proved to be a crucial moment in Dominique's career as it spawned the 'Sound Avenue with Madloch' radioshow which is broadcast on many international networks including the UK, South America, Russia, Mexico, USA and India. The show was also recently added to Proton Radio's impressive schedule which is also home to John Digweed's 'Transitions' and Hernan Cattaneo's 'Resident' radioshows.\r\n\r\nSound Avenue's second release of 2012 came in March and it was a monumental moment in the labels development. Mitrinique's 'Green Mountains' EP contained remixes from Petar Dundov, Eelke Kleijn and Facundo Mohrr. The Petar Dundov mix was featured on the February 25th episode of John Digweed's 'Transitions' radioshow and then featured by John again on his Best of 2012 Transitions to close out the year; further radio support came from Dave Seaman who featured the track on his Radiotherapy show and also from Guy J who included the track as part of one of his hugely influential promo mixes.\r\n\r\nAs 2012 progressed Sound Avenue continued to build on its rapidly growing fan base by compiling the labels first ever compilation. 'Explorer 01' was released in June and included fresh material from: Audio Junkie & Lonya, Audiotox & Overtone Watson, Dark Soul Project, Davy Dee, Fancy Vienna, Martin Garcia, Mitrinique, Vinayaka A and Yunta. The release received much praise both from Madloch's DJ contemporaries and the music press, it also enjoyed an extended stay in Beatport's top 100.\r\n\r\nOnce Sound Avenue had become one of the most influential imprints of the progressive house underground Dominque's Mitrinique alias (with Dimitri Chantzis) continued to grow as well. The production duo found themselves getting bombarded with productions requests and by the half way point of 2012 they had already amassed a discography that included appearances on Stellar Fountain, Mistique Music and 7senses.\r\nWith the success of Sound Avenue Dominque became inundated with quality demos of producers hoping to appear on the much hyped imprint. Rather than turn away such great material Dominique established a new label companion for Sound Avenue entitled 'Crossfade Sounds' which was introduced in the Summer of 2012. The label made it's mark early on with the first release from Noa Romana & Deersky. The track 'Metamorphosis' was featured in Beatport's Must Hear Progressive House records for the week of it's release and it was also Release Promo's #1 track for the entire month of July. It was clear that Crossfade Sounds focus was cutting edge underground electronic music with a deeper twist.\r\n\r\nA new chapter in Dominque's musical journey came in September of 2012 when he debuted his new solo studio alias 'Madloch'. His first single under the Madloch guise was entitled 'Colorshock' and it was accompanied with remixes from Manual Music's Paul Hazendonk and the hottly tipped Argentinean producer Marcelo Vasami. The single proved to be one of Sound Avenue's most hyped releases of the year as both the Marcelo Vasami and Paul Hazendonk remixes appeared in Hernan Cattaneo's September and October charts respectively.\r\n\r\nAs 2013 begins Madloch has a string of quality productions in the pipeline which look set to propel the Belgium producer further into the electronic music spotlight. The first quarter of 2013 sees a collaboration with the hugely popular Canadian duo Beat Syndrome entitled 'Waiting Game'. The track is forthcoming on Madloch's Sound Avenue imprint along with remixes from Bedrock's Luis Junior and Facundo Mohrr. And if that wasn't enough Movement Recordings, Lowbit Records, Soulfire Downloads, 99percentrecordings and Liquid Grooves all have 2013 releases confirmed with Madloch.\r\n\r\nThere is no telling where Madloch will be at years end but with his fortitude and eternal lust for electronic music perfection the sky is certainly the limit.",

Even though he comes from Belgium, Lionel’s style has been clearly influenced by Detroit Techno and can be described as deep, soulful, and melodic with a funky touch.\r\nYou may have heard of Lionel a few years ago under the alias “MGMX,” as he was producing tribal techno tracks that were released under labels such as Patterns and Adult, to name a few.\r\n\r\nLionel has always aimed to create techno music that comes from the heart and decided to return to one of his early loves. As he knew he had to improve his producing skills to create Detroit-like Techno, he decided to simply stop releasing new tracks and start back in the studio. His style slowly evolved into deeper and more melodic techno, and he again began releasing EPs and tracks under labels such as Greg Gow’s Restructured Recordings, Hype Muzik and Espai Music.\r\nBecause Lionel knew his career needed to be taken to a new level, he once again started back in the studio and quit releasing music for some time. After one year in the studio, his sound matured. It became clear that there was a distinct difference between Lionel’s old releases and his new style. In response to this change, he decided to work under his real name. Lionel’s musical identity was born.\r\n\r\nThe end of 2013 and the early months of 2014 have been amazingly important for Lionel as his work has been finally recognized by some of his biggest role models. He signed 2 EPs with A.R.T., one of the most legendary techno labels worldwide and owned by one of his all-time heroes: Kirk Degiorgio. Lionel then signed his second EP with Greg Gow’s Restructured Recordings.\r\n\r\nAs these strong releases were being planned and as his dreams were beginning to come true, Lionel became more confident and started to think there may be a small place for him in the techno scene.\r\n\r\nThen a few weeks later, Lionel signed his first album ever, on the mighty Motech Records; owned by the most famous Underground Resistance’s European ambassador: DJ 3000.\r\n\r\nDue to his day job and lack of free time to work on his productions, Lionel made a choice a few years ago to stop playing live or performing DJ sets to focus on his production. But all in all, as a response to these new releases and the joy - or the honor – as being recognized by a few of his heroes, Lionel came back to the floors.\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, Lionel also signed his first EP on the legendary Kevin Saunderson's KMS Records, one of the most famous Detroit Techno labels ever.\r\n\r\nHey guys, be ready for some stellar trips around the universe. The story begins here.",

  "artist_bio": "Bookings\r\nBelgium :: info@jackyourbody.be\r\nNetherlands :: Noor AgencyWith both of their families running successful clubs, it came as no surprise that the two guys from Miauw Miauw – Jackin’ Leo and Oliver G. – would end up in nightlife.  Being brought up in that environment turned out to be the ideal start for their career. Whether  as promotors, producers or Djs, these two friends have always managed to combine unfiltered pleasure  with an eye for quality and relentless dedication.\r\n\r\nMiauw Miauw have formed a solid team ever since they met on an illegal rave in the backyard of a mutual friend. Initially starting off as promotors of Techno parties in abandoned buildings and youth community halls, they slowly became more successful and worked their way up to ever bigger productions. Just about everyone who was anyone in Belgium played on their “Jack Your Body”-events at one time or another: from Marco Bailey to Yves De Ruyter to Filterheadz etc. \r\n\r\nAs they grew older their taste in music shifted towards a more House influenced style. This opened doors to other possibilities, eventually landing them a spot as guest promotors in what would become their homebase: Café d’Anvers. They now host two concepts there: 2ONE2 with the Floorfiller Agency, and a soon to be announced concept with Ghent’s House icon Seba Lecompte.  As Djs they played in just about every Belgian club worth mentioning: Café d’Anvers, Wood, Decadance, La Rocca and more. They stood their ground next to established names like Alli Borem, Gel Abril, Anek, Gui Borrato, Ida Engberg, Butch, Sharam Jay, Ramon Tapia,… \r\n\r\nThe future doesn’t exactly look like slowing down for the lads: their debut release is underway and besides their concepts in CDA they also continue to throw one off events and slowly build a name for themselves as the solid DJ duo they have become.  In other words: expect them to keep providing your dose of underground Tech House for many years to come.  You won’t be disappointed.",

Her first record Dreamland was released on vinyl in that same year.\r\n\r\nAnn developed an eclectic taste in music, ranging far and wide, from energetic grooves, housy vocals to a deeper spacy trippy  & dark sound.\r\n\r\nThere are no boundaries in music and that is the key to everything!\r\nIn 2014 she launched For The Love of Vinyl on Facebook, a community page for vinyl lovers & addicts.\r\n\r\nOnce a month you can hear her playing at Backstage Radio 107.4.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Ann or Alienna?\r\n\r\nMiss Ann represents the past, profound, raw & mostly old school sessions. ALIENNA represents the future, a new project with even more music from the heart. We keep you posted!",

  "name": "Marko La Rocca",
  "profile_photo": "http://www.residentadvisor.net/images/profiles/markolarocca.jpg",
  "cover_photo": "",
  "artist_bio": "For the past 14 years MARKO has been the resident DJ for the legendary “La Rocca on Sunday “nights, a quite remarkable achievement. He’s been called a specialist by some and middle of the road by others..but everyone agrees : this guy’s got real talent and is a true professional . For years his name has appeared  in the top 10 of the influential dance-music magazine  “Outsoon”  readers poll ( Belgian DJ’s ) , and in 2004 he was also voted Best Belgian Progressive DJ . \r\nHis main source of energy comes directly from the dance-floor..it’s feedback drives him on – he’s a past master at picking-up on it’s vibe and guiding it . Of course it helps that he has an amazing selection of vinyl, which he uses (like a master-chef uses his ingredients in the kitchen) to create an incredible atmosphere o..BIOGRAPHY :  Marko’s career begins in the late eighties, playing at first for private/exclusive parties. Then in 1990 he gets into “house” and becomes a regular DJ at” The Vaudeville “(a major club in Brussels). His weekly sets give him the feel for playing to a young and flourishing underground movement. As more and more gigs come his way, his reputation grows and he soon becomes established as an important figure in the vibrant Belgian dance-music scene.\r\n\r\n  Sensing the winds of change  and thanks to Eric Beysens ( AKA Eric Powa B )  , the legendary Belgian club “ La Rocca “ in Lier give Marko a musical ‘ carte blanche ‘ when they ask him to take-over their important Sunday night slot in 1992  . It was the beginning of an ongoing  love-affair between Marko and an ever expanding dance-floor of devotees ; these open-ended sessions giving him the space and opportunity to play long sets evolving through  different styles and sonic textures …… what an end to the week-end ! There are many world-class guest DJ’s that have appeared alongside Marko on these Sunday nights , such as : Michel De Hey , Charles Schillings , Blake Baxter , Andre Nalin , Trevor Rockcliffe , Armand Van Heldan , Sander Kleinenberg , David Morales , Oliver Moldan , Marcello , David Guetta , Felix Da Housecat , Dee-Nice , Sasha , Armin Van Buuren , Criss Source , 16 Bit lolitas , Dr Kucho , Tiestö – besides all the top DJ’s from the Belgian scene .\r\n\r\n\r\n  But his career has not just revolved around his celebrated “La Rocca “Sunday sessions. Residencies at top clubs such as “ The Villa “ ( 94-96 ) and “ The Fuse “ ( 96-97 ) , made Marko a ‘ major player ‘ in Belgium’s  clubbing scene . Not only that, he was getting involved with making tracks and mixing compilations (see discography). With his tireless enthusiasm and his obviously natural ability to DJ, Marko became greatly respected both as a human-being and as a DJ by professionals and public alike. Along the way he’s DJ’d at many massive events such as “ Rave Explosion , I love Techno , Impulz , Extrema , City Parade “ besides playing regularly at the major Belgian clubs ( eg Cherry Moon , Café d'Anvers , l’Extrême , Who’s Who’s Land , the Katsu ) . Not only that , he’s been playing frequently outside of Belgium ( eg Chemistry/Amsterdam , Pacha/Ibiza , K5/Ibiza , Space/Ibiza+Gran Canaria , Queen/Paris , 287/Paris , La Rocca Special/Manhattan , etc ) .\r\n\r\n\r\n  Within the format of a UK club – Progressive (at the Tour & Taxi site in Brussels) he was brought in to play alongside DJ’s such as Lucien Foort , Danny Howells , Ian Ossia from Renaissance , Cass and Lee Burridge in 1999 . In that same year he headlined at the La Rocca 10th anniversary party , playing to 10,000 revellers at the Sports Paleis in Antwerp ( an experience never to be forgotten ) – and when La Rocca went back there to celebrate the new Millenium he headlined in front of an ecstatic audience that had virtually doubled to 18,000 . \r\nHis passion for dance-music means that he’s one of the most ‘in-demand ‘DJ’s, regularly playing alongside top stars such as Carl Cox (in Warsaw Poland). Since 2000 he’s played gigs all over the European continent including  the Folies Pigalles , Red Light , Le Papagayo and Montana Club in France ; the very first Creamfields on the Baltic coast , SQ Klub and Piekarna in Poland ; the Solar Festival ( Extrema ) ; the Heineken Dance Parade in Rotterdam ; Nature One ; White Sensation ; Tomorrowland 2006 and 2007.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Back in Belgium, Marko has often featured in important line-ups at gigs such as the House Torhout festival in 2001 and 2002, the Dance-a-Delic festival (several years), the White Sensation event at Antwerp and the Cruises to Pleasure boat parties. It is also worth mentioning his appearances at the huge City Parade on his very own trailer/float (in front of more than 180,000 dance fanatics) in 2001/2002/2003/2004 but especially in 2005, when he wound up the whole proceedings playing on the final trailer/float – then ending up on an awaiting City Parade stage to an incredible reception ……what a buzz! \r\nIn terms of releases, Marko has put together many compilations released on diverse labels of which 8 have been devoted to La Rocca. In the 90’s he remixed lots of tracks for labels such as: NEWS, Mackenzie, Bonzai and Tripomatic. In 2001 he produced “ Guitar Overload “ with Ton TB on Massive Drive Recordings and worked together with Pole Folder on several remixes including “ Inner Turmoil “ ( released by Bedrock Records ) . More recently he’s worked with Franky Jones ( Enterprise Records ) and released a self-penned track “ Dark Orgy “ and a re-working of “ Indian Preach “ . His latest release is titled “4.5 “and is a “Marko on Sundays “remix.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Marko is not particularly bothered about being ‘fashionable ‘or ‘trendy ‘. It’s not simply by chance that his career has flourished and that his following has grown almost beyond belief over the last 14 years. Marko’s obvious passion for Dj’ing is derived from the vibe he gets from the dance-floor as well as the vibe he gets from the music he plays:  Marko plays from the heart!\r\n\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "The soundtrack to your night life\r\n\r\nLuno Maro, aka Kobayashy, provides the soundtrack for nightlife .With fantastic exciting sounds.He plays regularly at some great clubs and festivals“ The basics I learned on my own.”\r\n\r\nluno maro fell in love with music during his childhood. His favorite music? A refined selection of soul, funk, disco, Latin, world, jazz, new wave, rock, pop and hip hop\r\n\r\n“I did it my way”\r\n\r\nIn the late 80’s, Luno Maro started playing music himself. Walter: “The basics I learned from Lefto and on my own. But after some time I started building up my experience by taking part of several workshops and master classes. Among others? The DJ-lab in Hasselt, the DJ Academy in Antwerp, and a master class with DJ Bobby Ewing.”\r\n\r\nBelgium almost too little\r\n\r\nLuno Maro plays regularly at some great clubs and festivals: Decadance (Ghent), Charlatan (Ghent), Brussel Bad, Rock Ternat, Jospop (Schepdaal), Dance 2 the Moon (Diest), New Moon Party(Herzele), Belga dance awards (Leuven), Pop-up Store (Ghent) and the Pop-up bar (Ghent).\r\n\r\nLuno Maro: a huge name\r\n\r\nLuno Maro shared the decks with big names of the dance scene, such as Buscemi, Trish, Lady Vortex, Jan Van Biesen, Jens Holmes and lots of other great DJ’s. He was a guest at the Studio Brussels program Switch and on spits FM in the program 2dance 2chill. He was also laurelled at the Gabriel Rios Remix Contest\r\n\r\nGabriel Rios Remix Contest 2004\r\n\r\nSuccess for Luno Maro, aka …\r\n\r\nIt all started with a wild idea in the cafe, and before knew we the Remix contest was a fact. Top producer Jo Bogaert and musician Gabriel Rios asked the readers of PCM (and her sister publication Computer Magazine) to remix one of Rios’ songs.\r\nThe candidates had only five weeks time to deliver us a ready-made CD. Given the nature of the game we got almost all of the entries the last week. And how! Some wrapped made a homemade case for their CD (unfortunately they didn’t got extra points for that) and others used a paper bag from the Hema or a box off almost empty toilet rolls (to protect the CD, this also didn’t affect the jury).\r\nOriginality was the main criterion Then it was up to Mr. Rios and Bogaert to assess the remixes. Jo Bogaert and Gabriel Rios were pleasantly surprised by the level of entries. “Some of the remixes can immediately be put on record or CD”, said Jo Bogaert very soon. But the high standard of entries also ensured that all judging was very difficult. The main selection criterion? Originality. Result? Strong productions – and there were a lot of those – with a no surprising effect were not eligible for the Hall of Fame. Jo Bogaert and Gabriel Rios wanted to be surprised, and many readers were very successful in surprising them.\r\nWalter & Jack finished sixth.  The judges chose six winners from more than ninety submissions. Who was sixth? Luno Maro from the Belgian Ternat, A.K.A. Walter, with the help of Jack A.K.A Jacques Van Loock. The happy duo were very excited that they had fallen in prices: “Our formula? Mr Bogaert says A funky remix with drums and a catchy bass line running smoothly. A good vocal structure, texture and subtle dropbeats, small, well-dosed effects resulting in a sound that is good for the clubs.”\r\nJack & Walter used R eason 2.0 for their remix.\r\n\r\nA promising future\r\n\r\nAnd now? Walter: “Now I’m looking to make my way into the production world.” There for he travels to London to work and learn from the extremely experienced course tutor Alex Parsons in his London based 16 Steps studio and production school.\r\n\r\nLabels - 16 steps\r\n- Rebeat",

He discovers UK House upon a trip to London at age 15. Producing and performing on stage has been his fuel ever since.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, his debut Back To New York EP, released in 2013 on the Electronical Reeds label, managed to appear in TraxSource House Top 100 and What’s Hot. 2014 starts with an outstanding house release with additional remixes of label colleagues Superdrums and O.D.Math.There is no denying that Lex Newton knows how to handle a dance floor. It only takes a good mixer and a full frequency range sound system for Lex to drive an audience crazy. Be prepared for an evolving set full of straightforward rhythms, jazz inspired harmonies and dance floor moving tracks from this talented producer and DJ from Belgium. Add some finely crafted breaks and exhilarating climaxes, and you will most certainly get a night to remember.\r\n\r\nBorn in Brussels, Lex Newton was raised by the sound of disco, funk and jazz records and immerses himself early into music. For almost 15 years, he will learn classical and jazz music theory, piano and bass alongside renowned virtuosos. It is upon a trip to London in the mid 90s that Lex discovers UK House. This will be the birth of an unconditional love for chord based, snappy electronic music. A few months later, he begins producing his own tracks as well as composing and performing live in several West European countries behind keyboards, bass or drum machines for various projects. From that day on, the stage was his second home.\r\n\r\nLex decides to further improve his technical and producing skills and successfully graduates as a sound engineer. He then will learn deeply behind the mixing desks of music industry, live venues, TV and radio broadcasting.\r\n\r\nIn only a few months, Lex gets to remix JD Davis and the Belgian electronic music pioneer band Telex on the Pschent imprint. Putting in practice more than 10 years of production, he also kicks off his mastering services, putting the final touches to tracks by international heavyweights such as Chab, Pole Folder and Rodriguez JR on imprints like Abandon (Proton), A Must Have, Dirty Soul, Faith Music, Pschent or Reworck – to name just a few.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, his debut Back To New York EP, released in 2013 on the Electronical Reeds label, managed to appear in TraxSource House Top 100 and What’s Hot. 2014 starts with an outstanding house release with additional remixes of label colleagues Superdrums and O.D.Math.",

An artist of whom his work leave a mark into the memory of people, whether if it’s by producing or by performing.Surrounded by people that were very good in their certain aspect of music or sound, it was just a matter of time before Lycs took a dive into the world of music. The portal to the immersive world of being a part of music started with hiphop and turntablism for him. Even in the early stages of his career, the goal for him was to find musical excellence. That got confirmed by getting into the finals of Limbomania when he was 15, a contest in Limburg, Belgium, where musical acts get the chance to show their talents. \r\n\r\nSoon after that, an organization called Supercharged, offered him a spot to be a resident at their parties, introducing Lycs to electronic music. With a wide variety of styles available, the eternal discovery of music started to develop into a proper sense of what he wanted to do. One of the direct consequences of this was the sign of entrepreneurship. Organizing the pretty well known Belgian festival “Festivibe”, which ended in a success, this experience would take him a level up. \r\nIn the past 10 years, Lycs evolved into a digital performer that delivers no nonsense techno, coming from being a vinyl junkie. Next to that, he also dug very deep into the world of producing, either with hardware or with software. At the same time, he kept himself into a humble position as an artist, slowly flowing into the quality of performance and production that nowadays would be expected of high profile artists. Together with a number of undeniable influences, going from Speedy J, Ben Sims, Trish Van Eynde, Hermanez to new heroes as Pfirter, Flug, Hans Bouffmyhre and many others, it’s a sure thing that Lycs will find his way to the top.\r\n\r\nThe performances he brings are not very easy to get into words if you didn’t see it. A very good and brief description would be: “4 deck techno madness”. However, it’s actually more than this. Lycs will challenge you to listen carefully, and enjoy the music to the fullest. The selection of tracks in combination with a very thorough knowledge of his gear yield 2 different choices in people’s perception of his set. Either you’ll get absorbed by the perfectly executed synergy of the techno Lycs is bringing you, and dance your feet off until the lights go on. Or you find a guide in a journey throughout crazy combinations and clever use of anything that the digital world has to offer, which results into a constant astonishment of the listener. The choice is up to you, there’s no wrong in this one, only right.\r\nAs for now, he became one of the founding fathers of Technologik, and got signed with Systamatik Records. Techno cannot be stopped, and the constant movement of Lycs only confirms this.",

Then the Vaudeville (BE-Brussels), Club XXX (BE-Brussels), Mirano (BE-Brussels), Who's Who's (BE-Brussels) and the mighty La Rocca Ballroom (BE-Lier)... made up his musical culture. Back in the 90' and for a couple of years Nightblue was resident at the \"Maldoror\", one of the greatest night bars in Brussels. Since then he has nourished his love for house music and kept busy buying vinyl records mostly from the German underground house-minimal scene. \r\n\r\niTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/be/podcast/nightblues-podcast/id377611568 \r\nResident Advisor: http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/marcoakanightblue \r\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/marco.nightblue \r\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/marco-aka-nightblue",

In 2000, after almost having his second home in his favorite record store DOCTOR VINYL in Brussels, he started working there on Thursdays, which he still does. \r\n\r\nHaving the courage & ambition to promote his own dj-skills soon got him the attention of main Belgian promoters. He has been playing at FOOD, CAFÉ D’ANVERS, ORANGE CLUB  and at parties throughout the country. At these events he shared the decks with Belgium’s finest (Koenie, Raoul, Smos & Baby B, Geoffroy, St Dic, Pierre, Trish …) as well as with the better dj’ s from abroad (Derrick Carter, Mateo& Matos, Murray Richardson, Djulz, Luke Solomon, Kenny Hawkes, Felix the housecat, Frederik, Laurent Garnier, Sven Väth). In 2001, Marco caught the attention of some foreign promoters. Since then he played several times at MECCA in Prague (CZ). He also did some gigs in Sofia (CHOCOLATE) and Plovdiv (OPEN AIR) in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\nHis style can best be described as deep and dubby house/techno towards detroit beats and modern tech-house. Put him in the beginning or at the end of the evening, Marco does it all. Plays his music straight out of his hart, always delivering an exquisite record choice. Keep an eye on Marco 4 sure!\r\n",

He began his musical creation process at a young age in a very conventional way. He learned the classical guitar for 13 years in a music academy and played the guitar in a post-rock band whose influences were mixed genres (Sonic Youth, Blonde Redhead, Radiohead, Autechre, Plaid, Four Tet, and many others).\r\nBoth backgrounds make what Mutism's sound is.",

Trying to compose a music based on felt it of an outstanding life, him tell us his stories in his way. Sometimes dark, sometimes melancholic, always playing between the groove of the tech house and the minimal to obtain a mixture which is so particular to him. Underground in the soul, Odie stay before any an explorer leading diverse projects under diverse names.Odie Lawn was born in 1977 in Belgium. He is interested very young by the music, particularly in the groups as Pink Floyd, The Cure Kraftwerk or still Depeche Mode. In the 90s, he discovers a particular electronic music style with the Prodigy and begins to be interested has this new scene and more particularly to the lot of clubs present in Belgium in this period.\r\n In 95, he see Jeff Mills's set for the first time and it is for him a revelation. He begins to buy his vinyls first ones then his first decks. He turns at first to a very underground techno style strongly influenced by Detroit for open towards more alternative styles as the trip hop, the breakbeat or still the electro music. In this period, he becomes know under the name of DJ Shad and will have the opportunity to play in the various clubs and the present organizations in his birthplace Luik Belgium.\r\nAt the beginning of 2000s, tired by the techno movement which he judges in loss of speed and repetitive, he are going to dedicate itself during several years to alternative projects in Metal musique, but also in painting and writing. He disappear from the scene until 2007 or takes out the album War Storie from Unkle. Admiring, Odie plunges into the work of James Lavel and spend hours has to listen to his sets.\r\nAt the same time, he discovers the Crystal Method and he wants no more to restore envy for mixing. He begins again at first in a breakbeat style under the name of shad Dee and becomes resident on the English webradio “NSB RADIO” during one year.\r\nIn 2009, he create the evenings “Link the Beats” and officializes the name of Odie Lawn after a joke between friends. For two years, odie Lawn is specialize in a style more deep, more groove, sometimes dark and minimal and sometimes given rhythm and furious tech house. He squeezed during one year the DJ n°1 evenings Link the Beats and becomes resident DJ in one of the most renowned gay club of Belgium. The same year, he begins its work of production on Ableton. after one year has to look, he arrives finally has to find his sound.\r\nIn 2011, he takes out his official first track one on a Mexican label : Cancun Records.\r\nHis music style, clearly influenced by the work of artists such as Butch, Gorge, Tigerskin, John Tejada, And. Id, Joris Voorn and many more, turns to a tech house enough deep or minimal. Sometimes more rhythmic and sometimes more melodic but looking to create a unique athmosphere for every piece by transposing in pieces of his life. His big passion for the music allow himto listen to many different styles always today and we can clearly think that the work of Odie Lawn is not inspired that of the simple environmenthouse & tech house but also of artists of diverse horizons such as A.Skillz, Vent, Crystal Method, Adam Freeland, Limp Bizkit, Korn, Ninja Tunes, Depeche Mode, Placebo, Abe Duque, Triky and many many mores.",

His mother record collector and music fanatic, transferred him the love for the music, his father, a computer genius (since computers occupied whole apartments), transferred him the love for the technology  . Nicolas was always surrounded by vinyl records, tapes, floppy disks, perforated cards and various technological and musical instruments . He bought his first record in 1978  a Casio VL-1 in 1980 and in 1981 he was the proud owner of probably the first home computer ever arrived in Greece, a  Spectrum ZX81. Since then he started collecting music in all formats, messing around with primitive electronic sounds as new computers  and technologies kept arriving home. He also started kind of djing at school and friend parties till he got his first pro job at the age of 15.\r\nEverything started here....\r\n\r\nHis passion for electronic music started early with Depeche Mode,Kraftwerk, Frond 242, Vangelis, Jean Michel Jarre, but got into the next level in 1988 while he was in Belgium and felt (thank god!) the new beat, a sound called Acid House. He then started collecting records only from the electronic scene and very fast he was djing in underground and garage parties in Belgium, Holland and Germany under the name DjD or Nniko. During summertime he was spinning in the Greek islands (for the following 10 years, great years...).\r\nHe returned permanently in Greece back in 1996 studied and graduated from a sound technology institute and kept on djing in various clubs all over Greece (listed at the bottom).\r\n\r\nTechnology meets music.\r\n\r\nAs music and technology were for him the main reasons to live, he always tried to combine them in his life and work. The result of this was a software called Digital Sl1200 Mk-II in 1998 which permitted him to dj with a computer, making him one of the first dj's in the world to use this technology, which soon would be called ''Digital djing''. It was a great chance for him to be able to re-edit the best underground tracks and play them at the clubs directly from his Pc. This made him resident of the famous bar Z-00 presenting his FCDS (Full Computerized Digital Set or simpler Fuck CD's).\r\nFinal Scratch....\r\n\r\nIn 2003, because of his technological knowledge, his digital mixing, and his dj capabilities, he was nominated by Stanton as the Official Greek Stanton Final Scratch Dj presenting for the first time in Greece the Final Scratch, the latest technological equipment of the dj world. His contribution to the scene is huge, not only for promoting digital djing all around Greece, but also by helping numerous other dj's entering the digital djing world.\r\nRadio, record shop, magazines, events...\r\n\r\nAnother big love of Nicolas is the radio. This happened when he was invited for a dj set in a show of a legendary radio in Athens called Life Fm. Few years after he started hosting  some very successful radio shows at Radio 1, Free Fm, Cool Fm,  Free Radio.\r\nDuring 1998-1999 he worked at Storm record shop while writing music articles at Lemon magazine. \r\nA year later he became Chief editor of a new underground dance magazine Fast Forward while he cooperated and did the management of the legendary  team Qbase.\r\nIn 1998 he created SoniCreationS and started organizing events and bookings for various clubs while running his own Deep Electronique Atmosphere and DownTownUnderGround nights till now.\r\n\r\nProducing:\r\n\r\nNicolas Dales was always focused on djing and technology. This made him achieve the top position as an electronic dj in his country. This is represented by the following numbers:\r\n20+ years of djing\r\n20.000+ hours on the dexx\r\n1.000.000+ sold tickets\r\n100+ gigs in a year\r\nAfter an all time record of 113 events in one year, he decided to press a pause as a dj, moved to the Cyclades for 2.5 years and experimented in his studio with the sound... ''I always wanted to have new goals, to move higher... I played my edits, now I want to play my tracks''. And the production began!\r\n\r\nNow...\r\n\r\nBack to Athens now he is again in the center of the clubbing scene. Gigs in Greece and Europe, studio work, radio shows, collaborations with other artists. Batteries charged, full of energy and fresh ideas combining music and technology, Nicolas Dales is constantly working in introducing new sounds not only to the dancefloor but in his productions also! \r\n\r\nSo...

It didn’t take him long to translate his love for music into his current DJ career.He’s no stranger to the rougher electronic styles, which often can be found?in his most intriguing sets. It is due to this style that he gained fame with the crowd. In 2004 he started a career organizing parties and events. This is how ‘Obsessed By Music’ came to be. In the meantime Mr.Moore expanded his already vast area of styles into more eclectic sounds such as Electro-House, Electro-Tech and techno. He mastered these styles at his own organized events of Broad Minded and Kickerz. More recently he was declared one of the winners in the 2008 Pioneer-Pro DJ Contest, for which his well-earned reward was a spot in Go For Happy’s line-up. Mr. Moore shared the decks with dj’s as Claude Young, Mason, Mark EG, T-Quest, Dr Lektroluv, Dj Godfather, Umek, Dada Life, Alter Ego, D.I.M., Redhead, Ed & Kim, Frères deluxe, Jack de Marseille, Swirl people, The Subs, Sigi, Willie wartaal, aka the junkies, T-1000, Laston & Geo, Bart Skillz, Luke Slater and 2000 and one among others.",

These melted minds, warped perceptions and unorthodox sounds result into a steady stream of dark, heavy bounced tracks equipped with both depth and magnitude.\r\n\r\nThey have demonstrated a strong and inventive production style. Their tracks embody a 360-degree view of techno, balancing twisted, subtle pitch manipulations with a touch of no‐nonsense. The dark 4/4 stomps are dueling with the throbbing bass lines. Epic builds and eary melodies transforming into hypnotic and deep loaded grooves. Their music\r\nis free of crippling nostalgia and rather wins you over with consistency, tension and dynamics. One thing is crystal clear: they hit all the right spots, becoming an integral part of the Thrill Recordings family. They continue to move the label and its growing collective in dynamic directions.",

Soon after that, Modek remixed the Belgian rave classic Anasthasia by T99 and people started to get to know him and his dirty sound. This track also made it to Studio Brussel while Boomcrack went overseas, straight to Jaymo & Andy George’s BBC Radio One show.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Modek’s track Eat My Tank (created as a promo track for the Eat My Tank venue in his hometown) won the Hearus Producer contest and as a reward, he got to spend a day to mix and master it with help from Luuk “Shameboy” Cox. Once finished, Eat My Tank received quite a lot of playtime on the national radio.\r\n\r\nIn November 2009, Modek’s hard hitting Hiroshima won the Belgian National producers contest in the Electro/fidget genre. By then he’d also done a bunch of remixes for several labels (Monkey See Monkey Do, Sputnik/PIAS, G Point Muzik, Believe Electro) and had released his Kamikaze EP on Keatchen Records.\r\n\r\nToday, Modek’s tracks are being picked up and supported by a lot of Djs all around the world. With releases on respected labels such as Mental Groove and Dim Mak and a spot on the WKA roster, he keeps growing and expanding his fan base and is ready to take over Europe and the world!\r\n",

He started to work hard with this enormeous passion to become a dj and so he created his own very unique style, and psychology around it.\r\nIn the 2000’s he started playing at clothing shops, and selected underground party’s and clubs.\r\nSoon he became famous for his exlusive, odd, rare and well selected quality music with variety going from 70’s disco, deep house, detroit, chicago, and contemporary house styles.\r\nDifference, and strangeness, are the keywords for his style.\r\nLater on, he launched his own party concept “DEEP DOWN” first edition at the COULISSEN BRUGGE and\r\nplayed on thursdays in a small but qualitative club called “L’AMARAL”. The club began to like him and asked him to play on saturdays on special occassions.\r\nNowadays he is a residential dj for the ENTRENOUS club at bruges, RADIO VILLA BOTA and concepts of paradiso perduto, xenomaniax, and jackyourbody at ZURI KNOKKE. In 2010 he had the occasion to play on his first festival called ELEMENTS FESTIVAL in bruges.\r\nNow he is ready to continue his mission in to the future !",

For him, his job is to travel the world making people happy.\r\n\r\nComing from Gent, Belgium, he has been heavily influenced by the sound of New Beat, Rave, Acid House and Techno that was prominent in the late 80's, early 90's. And the first Dance 12\" he ever bought was Carl Craig (or 69)'s' 4 Jazz Funk Greats (he still cherishes it).\r\n\r\nBeing a musician/drummer at heart and growing up with both Hardcore, Punk, Soul, Funk and Dance music, his dj style is very eclectic, to say the least. As well as electro, he drop many styles into the mix, so you can expect a Dj set that \"Sounds like Keith Moon and Animal from The\r\nMuppets double teaming Diana Ross on top of a mixer while Henry Rollins watches!\"\r\n\r\nThis may be a good time to mention that James Murphy of a little band called LCD Soundsystem gave him the name ONE MAN PARTY after watching him go berzerk by himself on an empty dance floor! This has happened on many, many, many occasions..\r\n\r\nSteve's influenced by 2ManyDjs, Erol Alkan, Mr Oizo, Justice, James Murphy & Pat Mahoney, Maurice Fulton, Optimo, Riton, Carl Craig, Afrika Bambaataa and many others...\r\n\r\nHaving built up a name locally in the past years, he has recently ventured further abroad, as well as opening for Radio Soulwax. He's played such clubs as Webster Hall (New York), Studio B (Brooklyn), Fabric (London), Maria (Berlin), Social Club (Paris), Volar (Hong Kong)...",

  "artist_bio": "Hard to say.Damian Kotwica, known as Nishin Verdiano, was born in Sandomierz in Poland.\r\nHe grew up in a small city called Annopol.\r\nHis interest for music was noticable from his ealiest years.\r\nWhen he was 7, he got his first keyboard on which he than tried to play the melodies he heard on the radio. \r\nA few years later, his parents moved to Belgium and Damian ended up living with his grandparents.\r\nEvery time he had gotten some money from them, he didn't buy candy like all the other kids,\r\nbut he went to a record store and bought CD's instead. This is how he became aware of a certain genre, \r\ncalled techno, which he liked very much. \r\nLater, his parents came back in order to move to Belgium permanently. \r\nThis was quite a shock to Damian, cause he was about to leave everything he's ever known behind.\r\nIt wasn't easy at first, but fortunetely it wasn't long before he met some new friends with similar interests.\r\nOne of those was Marek, who was also polish and seemed to have a passion for music. \r\nSo as soon as they got their hands on a PC, they installed some music software and tried to make some records.\r\nOf cause, the results weren't too good at the beginning which made Marek give up on it.\r\nAs soon as Damian got his own PC, he went straigth to making music again.\r\nAt first he was making electronic sounding beats,\r\nbut than he came across a genre called hardstyle while listening to a CD he borrowed from a friend.\r\nSo he was trying to make something which would sound like it, but well... it was still worthless.\r\nSome time later, he began producing Hip-Hop and R&B beats which he was giving away for free.\r\nThis was a good way to spread his work and soon enough he was able to make some money off it.\r\nIt wasn't much, but is was enough for him to buy some professional recording gear on which he would continue his craft.\r\nBut Hip-Hop wasn't the way to go for him... Somehow it just didn't feel right. \r\nThis is why he ended up composing club music and trance which he still does.\r\nHe says \"I don't assign my music to one genre, because I make my music for it to sound right and not to fit in.\".\r\nThere is only one thing he can say about his carreer; it has just begun.",

  "artist_bio": "Brussels based electronic music producer. Founder at Echoes_ and resident for Fuse Club.Most creative souls find many different ways to express themselves, and this is no truer than of the modern musician. Operating out of Brussels with a dizzying list of projects and ventures to his name, Nathan Øye is one such individual who satisfies his artistic appetite by keeping very busy indeed. \r\n\r\nBorn and raised in the Belgian capital, Øye has long been an active figure in the city’s electronic music scene, and his lifetime devotion to the beat manifests itself in a string of notable performances, commissions and releases that complement his years of promotion and organization. He forms one third of live jam trio Kelket, which fuses improvised electronics and classical musicianship in a thrillingly unpredictable set that has already travelled to many places.\r\n\r\nØye also works as a solo producer on projects not bound by the demands of a night club dancefloor, having been approached to compose music for contemporary dance performances to be used in video clips as well as on stage. It has provided the ideal platform for him to express his more experimental tendencies while drawing on his experience in the deepest corners of modern techno. \r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy his appreciation of smaller club nights, Øye has also started Echoes_ as a label showcase-focused gathering which allows collectives of DJs and live acts to express themselves amongst likeminded company. The focus at these events is on dark, hypnotic techno in a reflection of the style Øye prefers to employ as a DJ. \r\n\r\nFrom jamming to composing, DJing to promoting, it’s hard to keep up with the many strings to Nathan Øye’s bow. It’s easier to trust in the quality of the work he is involved with, however he is entertaining you on any given occasion.",

The EP released by Lethal Dose Recordings is a sampler of the show.\r\n \r\nIn his live performance, Oliver builds a virtual machine based on proprietary sound and video recordings of machines from the period between 1850 and 1970. By doing this he explores the purest form of techno: machine percussion. Jean Tinguely is one of his sources of inspiration.\r\n \r\nFor the recordings, he conducted research to the whereabouts of 'working' machines from the 1900s. Oliver ended up in 7 museums in Belgium and in the Netherlands.",

  "artist_bio": "Deep & Tech House with a touch of Techno.(1984) Born & raised in Antwerp, Belgium.\r\n\r\nMusic has always been a very important part of his life. At the age of 15 he discovered a new type of music. It all began in a basement in a small town outside the city. He watched and listened Dave Clarke, Umek, Surgeon, T-Quest and others play over there and he fell in love with Techno music. With great admiration he listened to sets of Jeff Mills, Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, Carl Craig and other legends.\r\n\r\nWhen he purchased a mixer and turntables, he started spinning vinyl records of DJ's like Dejan Milicevic, Joey Beltram, Ben Sims, Marko Nastic, Whebba, Valentino Kanzyani and more of those Techno artists.\r\n\r\nAfter a while of playing together with DJ Neszouza as Moonwalkrz at a few parties (Montes, Clash of Styles, Kiss, I Love Tech-House, ...), the time had come to go further on his own.\r\n\r\nNotoir went to Ibiza, Amsterdam, Ljubljana, Barcelona, Novalja, Balaton, Dortmund and so on to visit the finest clubs and events and to discover the newest and from the highest quality electronic dance music...\r\n\r\nNow, he plays House and Techno from artists like Joris Voorn, Nic Fanciulli, Sante, Philip Bader, Davide Squillace, Nick Curly, &ME, Guy Gerber and from labels as Green, Cocoon, Rejected, Saved Records, VIVA Music and a lot more\r\n\r\nAfter winning the Kamp Noord DJ contest in 2014 he has played at several nice venues and he realized one of his dreams by playing at one of Belgium's finest underground clubs: Cafe d'Anvers.\r\n\r\nBecause his love for electronic music kept on growing he started producing his own music. And as a co-founder of Klank Music he hosts his own events.\r\n\r\nHe evolved from spinning with vinyl to Pioneer cdj's to Traktor, and from pure Techno to Tech House. At the meantime he developed his own style as a DJ .\r\n\r\nDeep and Tech House with a touch of Techno .",

Focusing on melody and groove, the two earn regular residencies at the respected Dali's Bar, the music lovers' Phonotherapy party and at the newly created Wax Club. All in Brussels.\r\n\r\nDeeply involved, journalism became another way to share qualitative music.

Phonotherapy parties are growing and now hosts international gigs along the crème de la crème of local djs. Alongside these promoter activities, he plunges himself in the production of music he always loved: deep house, drum & bass and dubstep with a heavy jazz influence.",

Club hits like ‘Ancova’, ‘Gold’ and ‘Lotus’ got picked up rapidly by artists around the globe (2 many dj’s, Crookers, Erol Alkan, Boys Noize, Tiga and beyond), putting Mumbai Science on the worlds EDM radar. Apart from their original work, Mumbai Science is building an impressive list of remixes. To date, the duo finished remixes for Mixhell (Boysnoize Records), Goose (!K7), Crookers (Southern Fried), Alex Gopher (Go 4 Music), Shameboy (East), Highbloo (Lektroluv) and Jaymo & Andy George (Moda Music).\r\n\r\nSo, what’s next for Mumbai Science? The duo plans to release not one, not two, but three (!!!) original EP’s in the coming months: “With this trilogy, I feel like we experimented with genres like New Beat, Future Techno, Acid and Electro… In a way, I think we tried to contemporize everything we liked from our youth… We just made something we think is quite cool”.

After a while both of them bought their first technics mk2 vinyl players and started to mix those tracks while hanging out with friends. Eventually this resulted in some bookings at local parties and bars, where they were often teaming up with their dj friends Nader & Lexis.\r\n\r\nAt this time they started to feel unsatisfied with the club/party scene in Belgium and started to travel trough Europe to checkout their idols at the most infamous festivals and clubs. Each time returning home with more and more inspiration to create their own concept. In 2012 this all led to the creation of Blockhaus, a party concept where underground house could be presented in the way it should.\r\n\r\nDepending on the crowd, location and atmosphere, their dj sets variate between the deepest underground from Berlin and Romania to the more Balearic sounds of Ibiza. All this without forgetting the true classics that marked our scene.",

Ramon Tapia was the result of this rather unique combination of circumstances, a producer whose eclectic past and upbringing combined to create one of the freshest sounds in techno music of recent years.\r\n\r\nRamon was born and raised in Holland, and followed in his father’s footsteps in his teenage years when he began producing. His mother met his father some years after he escaped from Pinochet’s Chile, where his own music had incensed the military government and made him a cultural dissident. Ramon’s youth was thankfully not as turbulent nor dangerous, with the young talent brought up on a musical diet that was incendiary in its own way: Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones, Kraftwerk, Front 242, and the early pioneers of Detroit techno. His two older sisters played a key part in his musical formation, sparking his imagination with tales of dance floor epiphanies upon their return from clubs of the country’s heyday. \r\n\r\nOnce bitten by the techno bug, Ramon moved to Belgium’s scene capital, Antwerp, to study as a jeweler and diamond cutter. It was a part-time job in a record shop that helped to decide his destiny, however. He began producing tracks with a colleague, and slowly learned to produce solo. After a fruitful period producing much tougher techno, a resurgent Ramon Tapia began to find fame under his new moniker in the late 2000s on labels like Herzblut, Craft and Yellow Tail, forging a new school techno sound that blended the slower, sexier sounds of the contemporary vibe with his schooling in the genre from the past few decades. In 2010 he mixed a compilation for New York’s legendary Strictly Rhythm, plundering their back catalogue for a full mix of new interpretations by him and various collaborators. This marked the biggest turning point in his career, catapulting him onto the world stage. “It was a great opportunity and made me grow in a lot of aspects.” he says. \r\n\r\nThe cream of Holland’s techno scene soon followed suit, with his worked snapped up by 2000 And One’s Remote Area and 100% Pure, Shinedoe’s Intacto and Secret Cinema’s Gem Records and further afield by Germany’s Great Stuff and Tiga’s Turbo. Remixes for Paul Weller, Armand van Helden, Nic Fanciulli, Marc Romboy, Monika Kruse, Mauro Picotto, DJ Sneak and Umek and many others came. Eventually in 2012 he set up his own labels, Say What? Recordings and collaboration label Aella Music (which he runs together with Hermanez) to proliferate his sound further. With tinges of his Latin background lacing his percussion sections and his Dutch/Belgian heritage providing the basis for his hard-grooving techno template, his sound is one that mixes organic, tribal rhythm and syncopation and electronic machinations to potent effect.\r\n\r\nRamon Tapia is a humble man enjoying his dream job. He just wants to carry on doing what he does best with no hyperbole, egomania or bullshit: rocking dancefloors and releasing infallible grooves. “I want to take Say What? Recordings to the next level, do some big collabs, just enjoy my work and let the music I make and DJ speak.”",

  "artist_bio": "Being a Fuse resident for over 20 years, he has played alongside the best dj’s in the world and is still maddening the crowd each weekend. In 2005, continuously searching to improve and take new challenges, Pierre created with Jessica Bossuyt their own brand [LesIzmo:r] to represent quality techno parties across Europe and also a booking and promotion agency. The [LesIzmo:r] record label and net label was launched soon after this.There are not many artists these days who manage to forge their reputation solely as a DJ, but Pierre comes proudly from an era when the craft of stitching records together into a meaningful experience had just as much importance placed on it as being the producer behind the tunes. From his position of influence as one of the long-standing residents of the world famous Fuse club, he has been responsible for countless moments of shock and awe amongst the club-going crowds of Brussels and beyond.\r\nHis roots are in the foundations of funk, soul and disco, although like any seasoned digger his tastes reach into the pulse of new wave and obscure 80s electronics. From catching the house and techno bug in 1991 at Fifty Five in Kuurne, he made a natural progression to spinning US deep house at a Sunday residency at Café d’Anvers, at a time when it was rarely heard in Belgium.\r\nThis determination to play the music he wanted to hear, whether fashionable or not, has guided his style ever since, and when Fuse opened in 1994 his remit to explore Detroit house and techno as one of the residents gave him the perfect platform to shape the identity of the iconic club.\r\nThrough the years of the mammoth I Love Techno events, sharing a radio show with Dave Clarke and delivering numerous mix albums, Pierre also found time to channel his groove instinct into studio sessions. Of these excursions, one of the most timeless is his “Reconstruction Mix” of Spokesman’s “Acid Creak”, originally released in 1994 and still slammed out at techno temples across the world to this day.\r\nHowever the increasingly knuckleheaded thump of schranz and other such monochromatic techno styles meant that Pierre’s focus started to evolve towards a more experimental style, and with JessicaBossuyt he started the Lessizmore events, label and booking agency as an outlet for the most creative aspects of European house and techno.\r\nThe boom in more adventurous minimal records in the early ‘00s was a perfect match for Pierre’s wild tastes, and as the credible corners of the scene kept moving on to pastures new so Lessizmore has evolved naturally to present some of the most exciting music revolving around, but not limited by, the 4/4 groove.\r\nWith his years served in the nightlife of Brussels Pierre has turned his hand to parties in unofficial locations, held down residencies at Le Triptyque in Paris and Arma 17 in Moscow and also been invited to launch the Fuse label. It’s this mixture of professional instinct and a constant hunger for new, challenging ways to experience music that have made Pierre such a lasting influence on generations of party people, with the art of his DJing and the direction of his events at the heart of what he does. In his own words, “whether it be for the Fuse’s bookings or those for my label Lessizmore, it’s more of a feeling and family business than anything else.”",

Little by little he improves his skills in producing and djing and earns the right to perform his first ‘official’ gig which take place at the Nocturne de l’Ulb in front of 5000 persons. Thanks to that, the Play Label’s crew noticed him… That was the beginning of a long story…\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he release three EP on the Belgian label 17:44 records and then acquired a certain visibility which allowed him to play in famous Belgian clubs such as Knal, Fuse, Wood, Wax Club and even in Luxembourg.

In 2000 he was already selected for the semi-finales of \"DJ Mania\", this was his first public appearance as a DJ. A few gigs on small parties and some private parties where the results. At the same time he was asked to join the Dogstyle party collective, as a resident and organizer for different underground events. In the meanwhile he also began playing drum'n'bass. Together with Marcozz and Cube, his partners in crime from Dogstyle, Quill rocked the decks on parties on different locations with international and national guests. The Dogstyle crew joined forces with DJ Peak and started the Phuzionz parties at the Silo, with lots of international and national guests.\r\n\r\nAlong with Marcozz (back then DJ Dust) he created the Digital Clones concept. They teamed up to spin drum'n'bass or electro-breakz. Check www.digitalclones.be for all info. This wasn't the end of Quill's solo career, he just gave his Digital Clones project with Marcozz a higher priority. He continued playing solo sets recognizable by his typical style and sound. He evolved from his typical techno sound to a more electro-injected style.\r\n\r\nHe got involved in different projects and organizations: Naranja, Relax Festival and Villa Basta. These participations resolved in a lot of gigs for Quill and also for Digital Clones.

Pole Folder is the owner of the label Reworck.Pole Folder is a Belgian electronic musician and live club performer, based in Brussels. A former protégée of the highly respected British DJ John Digweed, Pole Folder entered the limelight in 2001 as a DJ and producer at the forefront of the European progressive house movement, and has since evolved into a multi-instrumentalist and live performer of melodic-driven techno, tech house and deep house.\r\nHis critically acclaimed music has been released on some of electronic music's most prestigious record labels including Global Underground and Renaissance, as well as on Bedrock Records, which put out his best sellers 'Apollo Vibes' (2001) and 'Dust' (2003). Both were co-produced alongside renowned Belgian DJ CP.\r\nIn 2003, Digweed commissioned Pole Folder's debut artist album 'Zero Gold', and two years later it was released to worldwide praise from the electronic music media, including Resident Advisor, who gave it a 4.5/5 and described it as \"delicate atmospheric...musically rich...and one of those timeless pieces of music.\"\r\nSeveral 'Zero Gold' tracks such as 'Faith In Me' with vocalist Kirsty Hawkshaw and 'Salvation On Slavery Sins' have featured on hit US TV shows including Nip/Tuck and CSI, and Pole Folder and CP's 'Apollo Vibes' was featured in the movie 'Stark Raving Mad', with 'Dust' used as the backing music for Channel 4's advertising campaign in the U.K..\r\nSince 2003, Pole Folder has toured globally as a DJ and a live performer. His live shows aim to recreate the intricate and precise studio processes behind his music in a club environment, with synthesizers, mixing desks, FX boxes, laptops, and live vocalists fashioned by Pole Folder into a succinct club sound. He also plays guitar, synths, and trumpet, skills that he acquired during a long musical education that began at the age of 5.\r\nIn 2006, Pole Folder launched 'Destinations' on Frisky Radio, a show that was recorded live at various gigs worldwide. It garnered a huge following and led Frisky to ask Pole Folder to recreate this concept live in the studio for his first compilation, 'Destinations', which utilised both his regular Pioneer DJ set up, and a number of live instruments.\r\nAfter a couple of label experiments (La Tour, 80Hz), Pole Folder launched his own record label Reworck in 2010. The imprint represents a new dawn for Pole Folder as an artist. With his sound having evolved into the more melodic fringes of techno, tech house, and deep house, and his gigs focused solely on live performances, Reworck embodies his new sound, his wealth of musical expertise, and passion for intense, soul-touching, dance music. The label's first track 'Motel', received strong support from tastemakers including Argentina's Hernan Cattaneo who put it at No.1 in his June 2010 DJ chart. The label's second release 'Sabor A Mi' by German producer Sven Jaeger, was named Best Minimal cut by Germany's Raveline magazine in September 2010.",

Lush stuff.BRILLIANTLY BROKEN BEATS\r\nIn this narcotic urban jungle where hipsters are constantly trying to beat each other with their discoveries of the coolest underground meta-trash cult bands, Peter of ‘Son’ is trying to build something stickier, more lasting out of sound. \r\nHis wall of bleeps already earned the recognition of the ever-critical style police (WIRE, DeStandaard, Cimatics) and convincingly seduced some of the curious eavesdroppers out there (Pukkelpop, AB). \r\nOn his latest search for fresh horizons in soundscaping and after the release of his two first albums, Peter is determined not to pick up where he left but to pick in where he started as a child. \r\nWhether before it was all about the licks and the beats, he’s now planning a re-exploration of his classical music education.\r\n Coming out of a Belgian seaside rock-and-roll-version of the Von Trapp’s he might heat up a few of your favorite real-life traditional instruments and mash it up with a twisted, yet approachable electronic flavor. \r\nInspired by his beautiful lady muses, ‘The Two L’s’, who reside with him in a rooftop hacienda in the heart of Brussels, the newborn ‘Son’ is currently working his butt off to throw the album into the world asap.",

Already for 16 years in the business!\r\nAfter working for 8 years in one of the last vinyl record stores in Antwerp Wally's Groove World and also despite his young age he already made his mark on the nightlife and convinced many clubbers of his passion for music and granted many party people passionate memories. Since the last 2 years he started  in collaboration with Arne (Sunday Matinee) a quality deep house concept called iN yOUR fACE in Antwerp & Brussels.\r\nHis own unique style (let us say a very apparent style of house music) and his technical abilities have made him a popular guest on many quality inspired house concepts over the years. His name and fame are easily spreading over the borders. House lovers of France, Swiss, Spain ,Holland, Atlanta , Germany, Austria,  the UK and even Kazakhstan have had the chance of welcoming this new star.\r\nAnd last year  his  debut on Silver Network (one of the top classic deep house labels from the world winds 1999) with a remix for Subb-an!!! Soon an EP will follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat makes Pirrès rise above other dj's is his own signature sound. His love for electronic music ranging from unknown gems and carefully selected releases that suit his intelligent musical ideas. Genres like deephouse, electro, minimal and acid can be found in his versatile sets. The only guarentee he promises is the presence of black soul that will leave no listener untouched! His musical vision promises every listerner an unqiue journey into his black mind... .\r\n\r\nHe has shared the decks with all household names in Belgian club land and played alongside international guests as Peter Kruder & Dorfmeister, Laurent Garnier, Carl Craig, Henrik Schwarz, Miss Kittin, Tiga, M.A.N.D.Y, Tomas Anderson, Dj T, Booka Shade, Konrad Black, Pete Herbert, 2020 Soundsystem, Jef K, Erik Rug, Sound of Young New York, Ralph Lawson, Tim Paris, D'julz, Riton, Mj Cole, Theo Parrish Kenny Hawkes, and many others.\r\n\r\nPirrès has been invited by all major Belgium clubs to spread his sound . He was a resident at several concepts at different major clubs as REX club (Paris), Fabric, Atonium, Café d'Anvers, Café Capital, Culture Club, Decadance, Joan Collins Club and Petrol, where he is one of the 5 voor 12 residents. He is one the organisers of one of the last true underground concepts in Antwerp titled \"AMAI\" together with Koenie & Christian Lioret.\r\n\r\nWith over twelve years of dj-experience Pirrès is rapidly loosing the status of \"talent\" and can already be hold his own amongst Belgium's finest dj's. So weekend after weekend he spins his sexy records and creates fond memories with the nightlife people who attend his performances.\r\n\r\nOriginally from Bornem but he soon realised that the town was just too small so he relocated to Antwerp where he still lives and mostly plays. He immediately scored a residency in 2002 at Antwerp's premier house temple, Café d'Anvers where he showcased his skills and unqiue record selection for some time. After this breakthrough in his new hometown he began conquering all other Belgian cities such as Gent, Brussels and Luik and so his name became widely known in Belgium.\r\n\r\nPirrès has been a guest a different festivals such as Ten Days Off, Laundry Day, Rock Werchter and other local carnivals where he played for some diverse crowds. One of his mixes has aired on belgium's most popular Radio Station ”Studio Brussel” this broadcast gained him national recognition. In 2006 Studio Brussel even crowned him the best debut performer at the legendary Ten Days Off festival.\r\n\r\n2006 also saw him become titled as one of the \"Six from Antwerp\" meaning the six leading dj's/organisers in the Schelde town. The new year promises to be another exciting chapter in this young musicians career with bookings all over Belgium and surrounding countries.",

  "artist_bio": "Both born in Hasselt, Reygel & Peri (Matthias Reygel & Willem Jans) ran into each other in high school and soon after that it became clear they shared the same obsession with house music. It didn’t take long before they teamed up as deejays. While most of their friends would go to parties, Reygel & Peri would be the ones playing there. In the past years they have shared the decks with many of the greatest house deejays. In the summer of 2012 they took it to the next level and played at the City Parade, Les Ardentes and Tomorrowland.Both born in Hasselt, Reygel & Peri (Matthias Reygel & Willem Jans) ran into each other in high school and soon after that it became clear they shared the same obsession with house music. It didn’t take long before they teamed up as deejays. While most of their friends would go to parties, Reygel & Peri would be the ones playing there.\r\n\r\nGaining confidence from the crowd’s positive reactions they decided to turn it up a few notches. They entered numerous dj-competitions which always landed them in a top spot IF they didn’t win.\r\nAside from deejaying, Reygel & Peri became notorious for their bootlegs, mash-up’s and edits. Peri also works under his alias 'Animal Sounds' his remix for Wally Lopez's - Welcome Home was released on Versuz-Essentials.\r\n\r\nAfter almost a decade of tearing up floors together, Reygel & Peri have built up a solid reputation in doing so. This often gets them a spot to play at the big clubs or great venues. When they play early, they heat up the place nice and smooth. In any other case, they just break it down.\r\nIn the past years they have shared the decks with many of the greatest house deejays. In the summer of 2012 they took it to the next level and played at the City Parade, Les Ardentes and Tomorrowland. \r\n\r\nWhen they aren’t deejaying, they probably are looking for fresh tunes or they might be re-editing existing tracks, making them fit perfectly in their sets. Reygel & Peri deliver carefully selected house tracks, accompanied with the right amount of dancefloor nukes, which always gets the party from zero to mayhem.",

A genuine music collector & audacious selector, taking disco & house as a logical starting point, but certainly not as a terminus.\r\n\r\nHis style is hard to pinpoint, but he pushes a very eclectic taste of contemporary music in his sets, which embodies his unconditional love for electronic music and it's wide range of sub genres. An enthralling melange of disco, house, techno & electronica. At the same time he is crushing boundaries between musical eras, seeking & exploring the early beginning of electronic music & it's influences in modern dance music.\r\n\r\nBesides dj'ing Peregrine is a gifted promoter. From 2007 until 2014 he established his organizational talent by hosting Stand Your Ground in his hometown Sint-Truiden. He played a pioneering role in his region by promoting artists like Alden Tyrell (NL), San Soda, Spacid, Arches & Ed&Kim. Since 2012, he is one of the driving forces behind another promising underground party concept, The Woods!\r\n\r\nHe played alongside: Alden Tyrell (NL), The Glimmers, Monica Electronica (NL), San Soda, Pierre, Arches, Kill Frenzy, Rob Threezy (USA), FCL, Compuphonic, Spacid, Red D, Moonlight Matters, Ed&Kim, …\r\n\r\nHe played at venues like: Tomorrowland, Culture Club, Silo, Breakdown, Forty Five, Express 21, Daydream festival, Stand Your Ground, Hands Up!, Multivision, Sober, The Zoo, Rumba, ...",

Sending out constant diversity and well balanced suspense to the floor, he is in fact the guy that keeps the night young. So young that daytime often has to struggle to finally take over again.\r\nAs a 14-year old cup, he started mixing techno and house music, progressing into psychedelic trance and making his way to the top of the international trance mountain where he would firmly reside for about 5 years. Been there, done that, back to the roots.\r\nReturning to his initial love for house and techno music Pete re-launched himself the proper way. Starting among a pack of young wolves, he won the 2006 Laundry Day dj contest and became a leader once again. As his 'You Lucky Bitch' residency at the notorious Decadance club became a general residency, he launched concepts as Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Tijgerkracht and Clash Of The Mustache. If you've seen people like Nina Kraviz, Radio Slave, Jamie Jones, Marc Houle, Pan-Pot and Gregor Tresher spinning at Decadance, than you owe Pete a thank you. Or a drink. As you please.\r\nAs a dj he continued to perfect his blends of electronica, nu disco, deep house, house, tech house and techno, leading him to booths of events and clubs all over Belgium like Culture Club and Alpha x Nachtvogels Open Air. Rightfully sharing line-ups with Maceo Plex and Ben Pearce for example and being part of the feedback panel at Play&Produce.\r\nSo give your sharp senses a treat and follow Pete into his favourite woods of diverse quality dance music. Howling is allowed.",

After a two years migration in Berlin, Pipo moved back to his native Brussels town where he started to organize the famous « Letsmoke » parties. \r\n\r\nHe started to produce around that time and his productions have directly collected a full support from artists such as Samim, Guillaume & The Coutu-Dumonts, Mathias Kaden, Butane or Laurent Garnier to name just a few of them. \r\nHis dj skills has been made him play alongside dj's and live acts such as Mayaan Nidam, Ricardo Villalobos, Ryan Crosson, The Wighnomy Brothers, Seth Troxler, Jeremy P. Caulfield, Onur Ozer, Pheek, Mathias Kaden, Vincent Lemieux, Bandulu, James Pennington and Kenny Hawkes among others...\r\nAfter a 3 year home migration, Pipo Vitch moved back to Berlin to satisfy his hunger for fine electronic music. During the 4 years of his stay in « dickes B » city, he worked his skills on production and did regular appearances behind the decks in location such as Club Der Visionaere, Kater Holzig, Watergate and Golden Gate to name a few. His production skills rose at the same time while he was crafting his trademark grooves and exploring his unique sonic universe.\r\nHe finally started to run his own record label : Atomium Records that certainly will  imprint the world of electronic music. Its trademark and innovative concept pushes the creativity beyond the limits through collaborations between artists. Atomium’s concept is to focus on artist collaborations and since itbeginnng, many other labels have adopted the same strategy as a result of the outputs released on Atomium. \r\nTo quote Mike Rutherford « What you lose in compromise, you gain by collaboration!» and it certainly applies into electronic music fields.",

After deciding that his real passion lay in a more underground deep house sound in 2004 he began to claim residencies and performances in several clubs and bars in Belgium. Deepness still remains in his sound as a DJ and he considers it one of his keywords.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs with many DJs the natural progression was to production, in which Peckos began to take an interest in 2005. After four years experimenting in the studio the first results were finally ready and were quickly snapped up by several highly regarded labels.\r\n\r\n\r\n2009 became a breakthrough year with several EP’s on Lost My Dog, Guess Who, Gourmand Music Recordings, Booth Trax and Shak Digital. His tracks were remixed by house legends like Raoul Belmans, Vernon & Dacosta and Tommy Largo, and supported and charted by a wide range of DJ’s such as Mark Farina, Laurent Garnier, Lovebirds, DJ Sneak, Tony Humphries and JT Donaldson – just to name a few. His recent releases include EP’s on highly respected labels like Baker Street, Homecoming Music and Lost My Dog.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeckos’ simple, profound love for electronic music and a healthy dose of perseverance and creativity manifest itself in his productions and DJ sets, whether that’s booming beats, sensual sounds, g-spot grooves, mind-milking melodies, and other things that sound great, good or gentle.\r\n\r\n- \r\n\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/peckosmusic\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myspace.com/peckosmusic\r\n\r\nhttps://www.beatport.com/artist/peckos\r\n\r\nhttps://www.stompy.com/artist/peckos\r\n",

As a dj he has played and still plays in all the best clubs in Belgium, and every summer does some nice gigs in his second home country Ibiza. He is also resident-dj at 2 of the biggest radio shows in Belgium: Rotationz & Kondo Beach, which are broadcasted on several radio stations. His style of music goes from deep electronic house over tech house to mnml techno. As a producer he released his first official EP in 2009, together with his studio partner Karada. In 2011 came already their international breakthrough with the release of their “Hallelujaaahhh” EP on the label of Wally Lopez, Factoria. And more releases on big international labels followed soon (Deeperfect, Kling Klong, Gold, ...)!\r\n\r\n\r\nPedro Mercado started Dj-ing like most youngsters at Dj-contests and small local parties. Pretty soon he became monthly resident at the well known Club Decadance in Ghent (1998-2003). In 2005 he reached the semi-final of the Diesel-U-Music Dj-contest at Fuse Brussels. His dj-career really started to boom when he became an important part of the concept \"Rotationz, The Heart of Club Nature\" in 2006.\r\n\r\nRadioRotationz is one of the biggest radio shows in Belgium concerning Quality Electronic Dance Music (house, minimal, electro, progressive,...)!\r\nFor more info, check Rotationz\r\n\r\nSince 2003 every Saturday Rotationz host their national radio show on Topradio, the biggest dance fm radio station in Belgium, between 20.00 and 22.00 h (Topradio) where they introduce the newest tracks, artist albums, CD-compilations & the hottest Dj-mixes,...\r\n\r\nPedro Mercado still is co-host and resident-Dj of the show: he is the Tech House-freak of the Rotationz Team and every first Saturday of the month he hosts his own mix session which is called \"The Hottest Tech-House Sounds From The Underground\". On top of that he is responsable for all the Ibiza related topics in Rotationz and therefore he plays at Ibiza Parties all around in Belgium.\r\n\r\nPedro Mercado is also official promo reviewer of big international labels such as Bpitch Control, Hot Creations, Crosstown Rebels, La Factoria, Stereo Productions, Great Stuff, Kling Klong, Hot Fingers and many more. Finally he is one of the few Belgian DJ’s who has a Dj-page on Resident Advisor and a regular DJ-chart at Beatport.\r\n\r\nAdditionly to his Rotationz residency, Pedro Mercado started in July 2009 with a new monthly radio\r\nmix session called “Kondo Beach” where he presents the hottest Balearic-, Deep-, Epic-, & Tech-HOUSE! Kondo Beach is broadcasted on several Belgian radio stations.\r\nFor more info, check Kondo Beach sessions\r\n\r\nPedro Mercado played as Dj in the biggest Belgian Clubs like Café d'Anvers Antwerp (Circoloco, Mimazu, Peoples, Tape Tape), La Rocca Antwerp (Factomania Showcase, Club Local One, Dazzelin' Darling), Stereo Six (La Banda), Versuz Beach (Eivissa Clubbing), At The Villa, Club H2O, Club Decadance Ghent, Culture Club Ghent (La Clinique, Tease Your Ears), The Temple (Retro Arena), Riva (Rotationz Parties), Noxx Antwerp (Ketaloco), Make Up Ghent, Pulse Factory (4 years Rotationz), Escape Concept, Cherrymoon, Zuri (Jack Your Body), ICC Ghent (Reworxx), Flanders Expo Ghent (Liberty White)...\r\nAt these parties, he played alongside international dj’s such as Wally Lopez, Ismael Rivas, Joris Voorn, Davide Squillace, Butch, Matthias Tanzmann, Ida Engberg, Tania Vulcano, Barem, José De Devina, Tofke Guaperas, Hermanez, Ramon Tapia,...\r\nIn the summer of 2010 Pedro played also for the first time in his second home country Ibiza, on a catamaran boat party alongside Nicc Johnson from Pacha!\r\n\r\nThe next logic step was producing. Together with his studio partner Karada he released his first official EP in April 2009: “SOMETHING EP”, on the Belgian digital label Creamminal Records from former Ibiza-promotor & Dj Tofke Guaperas (nowadays promoting Circoloco, Cocoon, Matinée,... in Belgium together with Ugur Akkus as Labyrinth Productions). The leading track ‘Something Phat’ got a lot of airplay and was compiled on several CD’s. Other succesfull EP’s on Creamminal followed: “Gecko” EP and “Benirras” EP.\r\n\r\nMay 2011 was a very important moment in the producer career of Pedro Mercado & Karada. Their new track “Hallelujaaahhh” was released on one of the biggest labels in Spain, Factoria Records, the label of Wally Lopez. “Hallelujaaahhh” was already elected before as Track of the Year 2010 in the famous DJ MAG Top 100 Dj’s by Wally Lopez who played it also @ Space Ibiza Opening Fiesta 2011 with huge success! Later on that summer, “Hallelujaaahhh” was also hammered at Bora Bora Ibiza. At the end of the Ibiza Season, Pedro Mercado was invited to play at some gigs in Ibiza: in Guarana Club and Es Vive Experience Bar together with Space-dj’s Marco Loco & Issie Nixon. From then on he also does some guest mixes for Ibiza Global Radio.\r\n\r\nIn 2012 next to his DJ-gigs in Belgium & Ibiza and his radio sessions, Pedro Mercado wants to spend also a lot more time in the studio, focussing on releasing more own productions. So expect to hear from him so much more in the future because some releases on big international labels are already released in 2012 (Deeperfect, Kling Klong, Gold,...) and expect many others to follow!!!\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\ninfo/releases/remixes/radio: contact@pedromercado.eu\r\npromos: pedromercado@rotationz.be\r\nMobile: +32/(0)497.20.82.51\r\nDJ-bookings: booking@pedromercado.eu\r\nMore Info:\r\nhttp://www.myspace.com/djpedromercado\r\nhttp://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/pedromercado\r\nhttp://www.beatport.com/artist/pedro-mercado/103714\r\nhttp://www.pedromercado.eu\r\nhttp://www.mixcloud.com/pedromercado\r\nhttp://soundcloud.com/pedromercado\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/djpedromercado\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pedromercado.eu\r\nhttps://twitter.com/Pedro_Mercado_\r\n\r\n",

They come from the famous country of beer, chocolate and waffle … little Belgium.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, after years of being DJs, they made a big step towards production by setting up a small home studio and started to work on some remix contests (Aufgang, Zero7, Cora Novoa,..). It was a way for them to improve their skills and learn more tricks every day!\r\n\r\nPrisme is influenced by a various range of styles and artists - to name a few : Pinkfloyd, St Germain, Radiohead, Laurent Garner or more recently Patrice Baumel, Apparat, Agoria or Gui Goratto … You can easily imagine that they do not focus on one single style of music; all these influences reflect in the work of Prisme!\r\n\r\nCurrently, they are working on some new remixes and their first original track. Let's see what will happen next … they don't really care, they just love music and they do it for fun!!\r\n\r\nThey are also a part of the Electro-nation team (www.electro-nation.be), a weekly radio show aired booth live on FM station in belgium and worldwide by internet.\r\n\r\nxxx\r\n\r\nYou can also join their Facebook fan page here : \r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Prisme/157108024308522\r\n",

  "cover_photo": "",
  "artist_bio": "Raving George is an artist who loves the dark and melancholic sound of techno music.For all the emphasis on good times and euphoria in clubland there’s always been a dark side to electronic music, a side that 23 year old DJ/producer and one of Belgium’s most exciting new talents Charlotte de Witte, aka Raving George, has readily embraced.\r\n\r\n“I love the darkness you find in electronic music,” explains de Witte, “especially within Techno. I find melancholic music so much more interesting and dark sounding Techno really attracts me. When I look at the main stages of some of the world's most famous festivals and I see everyone dancing to this commercial, happy music, I don't really understand it.”\r\n\r\n“Dark music contains much more emotion. When I’m DJ’ing I want to try and touch the crowd and tell a story with the music. Of course I want them to party, get loose and have fun but at the same time I want them to remember the music long after the lights go up.”\r\n\r\nGrowing up with Belgium’s rich history of Electronic de Witte would discover Electro and Techno in her teens and was soon captivated by the hypnotic sounds she heard in the clubs around Ghent. By the age of 17 she had already made her debut behind the decks and her aggressive Techno sets soon caught the ears of some of Belgium’s biggest promoters, earning de Witte prime sets at festivals such as Pukkelpop and Tomorrowland.\r\n\r\nToday de Witte can include parties and festivals in the US, South Africa and all across Europe on her CV. Still her heart remains tied to the both the underground Techno scene and Belgium where she can be found championing new talent both on her Saturday night radio show, ‘Playground’ on Studio Brussels, Belgium’s leading radio station, and at KNTXT de Witte’s new residency at Brussels Techno institution Fuse.\r\n\r\nHaving moved into production de Witte has wasted no time in establishing herself as a serious talent in the studio as well as behind the decks. But whilst a Raving George DJ set is guaranteed to get you moving, Charlotte’s own music has provided her with a chance to reveal another side, an opportunity to dial down the BPMs and up the atmosphere. \r\n\r\n“When I’m DJ’ing it’ll mostly be Techno, hard, dark and aggressive. But when I’m in the studio I like to mix things up.” She explains. ”So I’ll still make club tracks but then a lot of the music that I’ll produce is slower, it has a heaviness to it. Making music really gives me a chance to tap into the more emotional side of electronic music that I love. Music that has that melancholic side to it, I just find it so much more interesting, whether DJ’ing, producing or just listening myself at home.” \r\n\r\nReleases in 2014 on labels like London’s cult Bad Life imprint quickly found favour with press, DJs and public alike, tracks such as ‘Slaves’ updating the grinding sound of New Beat and EBM for a new generation of electronic music fans.  \r\n\r\nWhilst those early releases earned her the respect of the underground club scene she calls home, it was her 2015 collaboration with another fast rising Belgian star Oscar & The Wolf that brought her to the attention of the world at large. Making no concession to the mainstream ‘You’re Mine’, an intense, atmospheric, mix of sombre, almost mournful, vocals and seductively dark electronica went Gold, selling over 15,000 copies in Belgium alone. \r\n\r\nWith ‘You’re Mine’ now set for a full international release, further EPs lined up for labels such as Tiga’s Turbo Recordings, her ongoing radio show, FUSE residency and a packed tour diary de Witte shows no sign of slowing down. Despite her love of all things dark, the future for Raving George looks very bright indeed.",

  "artist_bio": "Pussy Kontrol aka P/KTRL started spinning records in 2000. \r\nHis DJ name is a Slovakian pun on being able to master the turntable's pitch control.\r\nHis main influences stem mainly from the early minimal house waves of the 90s, techno, drum'n'bass and ambient. These days however, his focus is more on traditional house, and more recently 70s afrobeat, Thai funk and related outernational music as well as all kinds of disco edits.Now performing as P/KTRL. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, he co-founded a new Brussels based DJ collective called the Black Wigwam with his friend Gijs (DJ Someguy), aiming at bridging modern dance music with outernational music, disco, funk and soul.\r\n\r\nP/KTRL lives in Belgium since 2005 where he played several times with DJ Sensu at Café Belga in Brussels, in Café Restzeit in Eupen. In 2008, together with DJ Sensu, Koltempleister and Mikajel, he launched the Plain collective (now defunct). Plain organised a few parties in the Doucha bar in Brussels. He plays at gigs in Bratislava from time to time.\r\n\r\nUsed to be known also as Tyczko Czysticz  - his Detroit techno moniker, and as Mikka Miinimä - his creative laptop ‘fake-Nordic’ offshoot.  \r\nAs Shoggoth, he produced a mix of spoken word and music together with DJ Sensu, based on a horror story by H. P. Lovecraft named \"the Call of Cthulhu\". \r\n\r\nHaving played, amongst others, with Portable and DNC in front of thousands at the Orion Hall in Brno in the Czech Republic in 2003, with Andy Vaz in a tea-bar in Banska Bystrica in Slovakia and, also there, at the Barbakan festival as well, Pussy Kontrol’s main focus these days is house music. Other DJ’s he’s played with in Bratislava's clubs U-CLu (Subclub), NuSpirit Club and Bar, Spojka and others, include Ramadanman, Headhunter, Peverelist, Jeff Milligan, Dave Miller, dB, SLG, Subb-Ann. His favourite DJ experiences include playing with his friend DJ Milos(h) at uncountable places, his brother Bruyant (initially as \"M&M\"), occasional \"ping-pong set with the vintage-addicted and laptop wizard DNC/Dunco (as Tyczko, running sporadic bar gigs named Tits'n'Clits). \r\n\r\nMember of the Intergalactic FM community: pktrl.hott.mx",

  "artist_bio": "Raw District is the new house project from Belgian duo Vernon Bara and Massimo DaCosta.Raw District is the new house project from Belgian duo Vernon Bara and Massimo DaCosta, which debuts on their own label Homecoming Music.\r\nHaving met in a Mons record shop in 2000, under the Vernon&DaCosta name, they have released music on labels such as OM Records, AMA Rec, Robsoul, Aroma, OFF, Icon, Doubledown and many more of the world’s finest underground house labels. They have remixed for artists such as Brett Johnson, Fred Everything, Style of Eye, Miguel Migs and JT Donaldson and have garnered a reputation as important international producers and DJs with respect paid by great DJs like Luciano, Ricardo Villalobos, Jamie Jones, Mark Farina and DJ Sneak. Vernon Bara also makes music as Ultrasone alongside Igor Vicente, which is a more techno orientated project that can count releases on Hot Creation and Supplement Facts to its name.\r\n\r\nVernon and Massimo pair set up their own imprint Homecoming Music in 2010, in order to release music by themselves and their friends. The label has released music by artists such as Brett Johnson, DJ W!LD, Chris Carrier, Djebali, Gulivert, Phil Weeks, Tripmastaz and Inland Knights amongst others.\r\n\r\nEarly in 2013, they decided to start a new side project called ‘Raw District’ which will see them focus on the darker and deeper side of House music. In their own words, “Raw District tracks will feature fewer samples and more organic influences. However, the trademark soul, funk and disco influences will still be evident, mixed up with the fresh European sounds coming from Berlin.” Future vocal collaborations are penned with artists such as Ingrid Hakanson, Ellipsis (who worked with Brett Johnson on his last Visionquest release) and Texan Red Eye (known for work with Phil Weeks and Demarkus Lewis).",

In 2013 that name will be Slow Mo.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the man's history, it is no coincidence that Mo's life is filled with music. After some dark juvenile years at the Belgian coast Mo ended up in Ghent where he rapidly became involved in the city's rich night life scene. First as the manager of the infamous Suite 16 club, later as the heritor of the Make Up Club. In short time Mo had stepped up to become one of the leading players in the underground scene of Ghent. Unforeseen circumstances made an end to the success story of the mythical joint. Filled with anger and full of grief Mo decided to leave Ghent to begin a new chapter in Berlin.\r\n\r\nIn the city that never sleeps Mo made a severe switch in his career. Overwhelmed by tons of beautiful tunes from the countless clubs Berlin holds he decided to produce electronic music. Slow Mo was born. The first real productions were well received. Positive vibes encouraged him to go further and deeper. Back in Ghent Slow Mo joined forces with his old friend Stereo Express and José Noventa. The result of their partnership was the birth of new label: Love Matters. Their new brand will become the face of Belgium's underground scene, creating some of the most exciting pieces of deep house music the country has ever heard. Love Matters will inject the scene with a fresh musical breeze. Moreover Slow Mo will distinguish himself by offering the audience more than a deejay set. Armed with a saxophone, keyboards and live vocals the man will stagger you with a full live experience.\r\n\r\nTouched by every piece of music, from classic soul of the fifties to synth pop music of the eighties Mo's aim is to affect your heart and to move your feet.

There, once settled behind his trusty Technics, he played all the early electronic music this dance culture had to offer in those days.\r\n-\r\nTogether with some friends, Spacid organised his first parties in 1992, which turned out to be a big success and paved the way to setting up the club Carioca. He was only 17 then. The club was short-lived but is still remembered as one the legendary and trendsetting clubs in Belgium.\r\n-\r\n1994 saw the founding of Funky Green Aliens, a party organisation and booking agency concentrating on promoting groundbreaking music & arts and introducing international artists to the Belgian scene. These parties, mostly illegal, were very successful and still to this day represent the true roots of Spacid's dj career.\r\n-\r\nBy 1997 his name started popping up in all major Belgian clubs and events and he was propelled to slots at the biggest clubs and parties in Belgium such as, Dance Valley, Kozzmozz, Ten Days Off, etc.\r\n-\r\nHe also became resident at various important party concepts such the legendary Body 2 Body parties at Culture Club, Beats of Love, Lazerdance, Elektron, Retro Acid, Ultra …\r\n-\r\nIn 2009 he came in 6th in the Best Belgian Dj polls of the Belgian Nightcode magazine. Only Dr. Lectroluv was listed before him as electro dj. And he received other awards as well, among others on the Partyguide site, he was voted 2nd best electro dj, three years in a row and in 2007 he came in 5th as all-round dj and 4th in 2006 alongside names as 2 Many Dj’s, Discobar Galaxie, Ed & Kim and The Glimmers.\r\n-\r\nAs the label boss of Radius Records, he gave the label in 2003 its first big exposure with a mix compilation by himself, named “Theme From Radius”. The label’s goal was to seek and explore the foundations of the electronic influences of the 70’s and 80’s italo disco, highlighting not only its innovative aspect, but also its importance in today's electronic dance music. The label played a pioneering role in the modern new disco sound and offered a platform for then unknown producers such as Tensnake and Moonlight Matters. During that time, Spacid also traveled around Europe to fire up dancefloors with this disco sounds.\r\n-\r\nSpacid has a nose for creativity and has always been an early adopter. It’s fair to say that when Spacid spots a new qualitative subgenre, he’s one of the first to promote it. He’s a dj who evolves and is above trends. He can be regarded as a pioneer in early house, techno as well as electro. This attitude makes him a most versatile dj you can easily find playing various genres like, minimal, deep house, all shades of electro, acid, techno and the one thing of which he is an avid collector: disco in all its forms.\r\n-\r\nSpacid is also a regular and very welcome guest at both Belgian and international events. He played at 10 Days Off 7 times, Tomorrowland 5 times and rocked the dancefloor at I Love Techno 4 times. He’s been at an impressive amount of clubs, parties and festivals in and out of the country (you can find a complete overview at www.spacid.be / past gigs).\r\n\r\nHe played at festivals and clubs in France, the Netherlands, Germany, the UK, Poland and Malta. He manned the decks in British clubs and parties like Club Trash, Herbal, The Key, House of God, Downtownsounds, Human Zoo, Death disco and played in about every major Dutch club such as Paradiso, Club 013, Melkweg, Effenaar, Doornroosje. He was even invited at the Berlin Weekend club and Paris's 'Respect is Burning'.\r\n-\r\nAmong the festivals he played at you can find Pukkelpop, House Torhout, Boomtown, Laundry Day, Dance Valley, Tomorrowland and you can find him in the dj booth at parties and clubs such as Culture Club, Café D’Anvers, Kozzmozz, Petrol and many more.\r\n-\r\nSpacid is not tied to one particular style. He’s a very versatile and flexible dj. He can play various styles of electronic music depending on the venue, people or mood of the party.\r\n-\r\nIt’s safe to say that Spacid is an established value in the Belgian club circuit and he has a strong fan base.\r\n\r\nHe has a colourful 21 years of dj-ing experience. And it shows! Whenever he’s working the dancefloor, the party is always hot and intense!\r\n\r\nA real ambassador of the vibrant club scene, both his quest for innovation and his reverence for the past transpire in his work as a dj.\r\n-\r\nYou can listen and download online sets at \r\nwww.soundcloud.com/spacid \r\n-\r\nFor more info, bio and his agenda, \r\nvisit his website www.spacid.be or Facebook page www.facebook.com/spacid \r\n\r\n-\r\nLast update: 12-2011\r\n\r\n- \r\n-",

Or Hart to Hart? It doesn’t. It has bugger all. No heroes, no drama, no action. Chocolates, beer and Spirit Catcher. \r\n\r\nJean Vanesse and Thomas Sohet have been exposed to music for as long as they have been conscious. Jean was even born in a recording studio. His father owned a studio, and absolutely insisted on capturing a high quality recording of the birth. However, initial feedback problems due to the unexpectedly high pitch of Jeans first baby screams meant that Jean had to climb back in for a second and third take, so his father could take care of the rogue frequency. This led to a deep-seated psychological need for Jean to keep going back in to studios, over and over, again and again, in search of the perfect EQ settings which could set him free from this cycle. \r\n\r\nThomas, meanwhile, was born in an ordinary Belgian hospital room to the sounds of an Earth, Wind and Fire cassette of his mothers. As he took his first gaze around the room, he soaked up its covering of black and white tiles. White, black, white, blackstrange levers and machinesthe vision burned deep into his psyche while the music played, then lay dormant for years. It was suddenly triggered when he saw a synthesizer as a teenager. Those black and white keys, the modulation wheel.the tiles and levers of the grooving hospital room suddenly surged back through his brain. A booming voice inside Tom told him that if one day he pressed them in the right combination, he would be free. He must find The Formula. So he played and played, hiding away in funk bands, trying as many combinations as he could, waiting for the explosive moment when life would finally make sense, as it had in that hospital room. \r\n\r\nAnd now? Well, Spirit Catcher have become one of the most in-demand house acts, gracing the finest underground labels with their polished future disco sound. But to those who know them, Tom and Jean are simply a pair of misfits looking for life and love between the keyboard keys and the automated faders. Two kids born into the sounds of the seventies, then immediately grabbed by the cruel talons of music and doomed to seek solution in the groove. Luckily, through the help of well-meaning record labels such as Silver Network, Freerange, Winding Road, Missive and Moodmusic, we can all listen in to the frenzied disco workouts through which they exorcise their murky pasts.\r\n",

Welcome to Smootrab’s Jungle\r\n\r\nSmootrab (Bart Ooms) was born in Antwerp, Belgium in 1980. At the age of 14 he started off as a local DJ (by the alter ego 'Jigs') and kept following the music scene since. Concentrating on his studies and family, he never focused on becoming a known name in the club scene. Now, many years later, he found a way to be more creative with his twisted musical mind. As a new upcoming producer, with his first release in 2011 and with a total of more than 30 productions and collaborations by the end of 2011, he’s trying to put his stamp in the music scene over the coming years.",

The real live played electronic drum beats combined with the live triggered mash up mixes are a true energy booster.\r\nAccording to a Canadian music journalist, after Michael’s set at the MuTek festival in Montreal, June 2010 : “ Live played V-Drums and samples fire soundwaves & grooves ...and MOVE party people...”",

Do expect some house, techno, disco, or even jazz or hiphop when the mood is right!\r\nUnder the monikker \"smooth's selection\" I play a selection of my finest \"listening records\", with what I mean, records that I buy for home-listening, not focused on only the dancefloor. But shure as hell you can dance to it!\r\n\r\nWith the MoneyMechanics collective me and my friends organise party's beyond the boundaries of \"just another party\".\r\nThe party's are mostly house & techno minded, but are not only focussed on the music.

His brother in law, the in Ibiza based Antony Nardella, introduced him to deejaying with the intense and pure techno from artists like The Advent, Jeff Mills and Chris Liebing. The first vinyl Rupert bought was ‘Watch It’ by Robert Armani. Harvey set his first steps in Belgian clubscene at the iconic Cherry Moon where he discovered music we now call retro. Artists like Speedy J, Green Velvet and Laurent Garnier filled his recordbag. When Cherry Moon closed, it left a black hole. Hardtechno took that place in his life and in his sets after Manu Kenton’s legendary birthdayparty in Lagoa with Marco Remus.His girlfriend tried getting him into the new minimalsound. But that gap in BPM was just a little too big. He bridged the gap between hardtechno and minimal with artists like Carl Cox and Dave Clarke. But it was Tom Dazing’s set at Forest Festival that convinced him he could combine the classics in his recordbag with the new sound. Rupert Harvey found his sound and Tecnum saw that it was a unique combination. He gave him a residency at his travelling party Djingel Djangel. It took him from the decks in his room to venues like Nijdrop, The Zoo and Café d’Anvers. It didn’t take long for Seba Lecompte to recognize the talent and skills of this young DJ. He booked him for Bang The Box and Minibox in Decadance.\r\nMore bookings rolled in and he became a resident at Wham! With the list of gigs growing he shared the decks with artists like Monika Kruse, Pete Howl, Lucas Caroso, Marco Carola, Hermanez, Massimo Girardi, Seba Lecompte, Onno, Dimitri Andreas, Deltano, tINI, Soren Aalberg, Stanny Franssen, Audiofly, Martin Buttrich, Simina Grigoriu, Lou Lou Players, Stereo Express, Steve Abot, Tom Hades and Tom Dazing. In 2013 he and Jellen are starting their own party called Nachtwacht. If you want to book Rupert Harvey for your gig, please contact Sonic Vision.\r\nRupert Harvey today is a mix of 10 years discovering music in different genres and combining all their best elements. A Rupert Harvey set combines a tight running bass that never stops nor trembles. A little hint of retro here and there to spice up the smooth sound of minimal and techhouse. And not to forget a good vocal to tribute his love for hiphop. He flips his records like two-face flips his coin. The classics, the retro and the harder tracks on one side, the new things from labels like Desolat, Saved Records, Aella, Monique musique, Inmotion, Moon harbour, Suara, Kiara records and Viva music on the other.\r\nMusic has been Rupert Harvey’s passion for many years. When he wasn’t mixing he was juggling with beats in fruityloops. He took a class in Ableton because he wanted to take producing more serious. Harvey started working in the studio with former recordshop owner Crack and Crunch who showed him how to juggle all the beats into a song. They released a remix together for punk’id records begin 2013. In the spring of 2013 his first solo release comes out on Hit By A Truck Records. And this is just the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\nRupert Harvey on…\r\nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/pages/Rupert-Harvey/132574412514?fref=ts)\r\nSoundcloud (https://soundcloud.com/rupert-harvey)\r\nResident Advisor (http://www.residentadvisor.net/profile/rupert_harvey)\r\nMixcloud (http://www.mixcloud.com/rupert_harvey/)\r\nTwitter (https://twitter.com/RupertHarvey1)\r\nFor Bookings and info\r\nSonic Vision (www.sonicvisionbookings.com)",

Inspired by the musical vibes of his father, he started experimenting with digital samplers and synths as early as his tenth birthday. The pathway to electronic dance music was already steadily set.\r\n\r\nAt the age of eighteen, Sem Thomasson released his first record—the result of eight years of strenuous hard work. The deejay bookings followed only a short while after and the start of his rich musical career could not have been better planned. He is now fully prepared to let the world meet with his peculiar sound and natural talent for making greatly accessible dance tracks. A mix of Tech-House and Progressive Techno are the key to his producing and deejaying succes.\r\n\r\nNot only are his productions of high quality, they also seem to have an immense impact on the crowd. He has received great feedback from none less than Laidback Luke, Bingo Players, Dj Tiësto, Steve Angello, Davd Guetta, Erick Morillo, David Vendetta, Funkerman, Alex Kenji, Roger Sanchez, Max Vangeli, Kim Fai, Peter Gelderblom, Oliver Lang, Prok & Fitch, Flash Brothers, Tom Novy, Gregor Salto, Joachim Garraud, Stephan Hinz, Pole Folder, Lake & Lys, Andrea Belli and many many more other deejays and producers.\r\n\r\nHis music penetrates right through your body to the very core of your dancing nerve centre and that is something not easily achieved. Sem Thomasson is a remarkable talent, someone who knows exactly which way his ship is sailing, without losing the dynamics to steer left or right at a certain point. You will be hearing more from him, no doubt!",

So I keep this approach when I am behind the studio mixing board and I can put in front the essence of the track.”“My favorite game is to grab the audience with some \"Fresh & Groovy\" house and transform the dancefloor in a dancing playground until dawn. So I keep this approach when I am behind the studio mixing board and I can put in front the essence of the track.”\r\n\r\nSouldust is Belgian producer, DJ and sound engineer who dedicates his life to music in all its forms.\r\nFrom an early age, the interest in that matter won his spirit. Learning began with the music theory and the guitar but his world opened soon to a new dimension! Touching his first mixing board, he discovered the profession of sound engineer. In the same time, Souldust entered the worlds of the vinyl and the electronic music during a trip to London in 1997.\r\nThen came the desire to know more! Souldust enrolled at the IAD, recognized school in the audio-visual, where he learned sound engineering. His studies did not stop him to start his DJ career.\r\nGraduated in 2004, Souldust launched headlong into the music. He continued djing in Brussels' nightlife and became a resident at \"Jeux d'Hiver\", trendy club in the capital. He did not abandon his job as sound engineer and learned a lot behind the mixing boards of the music industry, TV and radio broadcasting and live performances.\r\nIn 2007, Neptune Studio was born, a brand new space that allowed artists and labels to improve their sound, making it professional. Souldust worked with renowned and emerging artists alike. For two years, he was continuing his momentum until he leaved his residence at \"Jeux d'Hiver\" to co-found Borderline Corp. He managed the team, produced, directed and hosted the Borderline Corp on Air radio show. For two years the group has been the instigator of popular Sunday evenings in Brussels. These had hosted international artists such as Pole Folder, Robert Babicz and Guy J.\r\nSouldust also became Artistic Director of Café des Halles. A whole new world opened up for him but in 2011, working with the Café des Halles and Borderline Corp. had to stop, lack of means.\r\nIn late 2011, Souldust's career embraced producing and began with two remixes; Lex Newton - Bushido and Felix Cage feat. Lazarusman - Love Again. This propelled him into the download platforms such as Beatport or Whatpeopleplay. Souldust is now worldwide!\r\nThen, with 2012 comes new opportunities, that of resuming his residence at \"Jeux d'Hiver\" as well as Artistic Director at Café des Halles.\r\nIn 2013, he leaves both places to put himself totally into Electronical Reeds and his DJ career.\r\nToday Souldust is A&R and head of sound for Electronical Reeds and still develops his studio, where he takes care of mix and mastering. He also continues to spin in many hype clubs around Belgium.",

  "artist_bio": "Synthpop with an eighties twistDuring the hot Belgian Summer of 2011, out of the dark and into the blue, a boy and a girl collide to create Shindu. Chibi and Christopher exploded on to the electronic dance scene with their debut EP ‘Happy House’, which had a solid release on renowned French label Kitsuné. Shindu rapidly were called a new and refreshing synthpopsensation, dreaming up stories to create jaunty yet clever tracks drenched in late 80s electronica and atmospherics.\r\n\r\nAs every tale has its beginning, so does this dynamic duo. Chris started out as a dj with a repertory mainly consisting of miscellaneous electro and pop digressions. Minds tend to change and so did his ambition to aim for a higher level of music perception. Along the journey roaming different venues, clubs, studios, radio shows and meeting industry big shots over the years, the time felt right to reinvent himself. Merging with Shindu’s leading lady Chibi, meant creating electronic pop chemistry. She carries Shindu’s vocals on a carpet of colors.\r\n\r\nThese music makers deliver tracks in their typical unrestrained and spontaneous way, whether it’s in the studio or behind decks, they always bear happiness and love wherever they go.\r\n\r\nShindu literally means a celebration with friends, a drive along sunny roads, shorelessly being yourself in a continuous loop…",

By searching deeper into the world of hardware he discovered the magic sound of the TB303.\r\n \r\nMeanwhile over the years his sound evolved, getting more dark and mental. \r\n\r\nAfter 3 years he became a well known artist in the free party scene and played at party's all over the Netherlands, France and Belgium. Doing this he got the chanse to spread his sound in many places. As a result he got his first vinyl release in 2011 and many to follow... \r\n\r\nBy getting involved with vinyl he also wanted to play them so he bought himself 2 turntables and the shit was really on !! \r\n\r\nToday Sevenum Six is actively working on bringing you an original sounding liveset and fresh vinylmixes.\r\n\r\nin 2013 he started to switch over on techno sounds.\r\n",

He will bring you some deeper, groovy garage house with soul & hip hop influences. \r\n\r\nMusic// Floorfiller (BE) | Coyote Cuts (USA) | Urban Dubs (UK) | House Grand Cru (BE) | Antelope (BE) | Meltin Funk (FR) | Clean & Dirty (BE) l Groovetraxx (BE) | Jazzy butterfly records (BE)\r\n\r\nCuriously passioned about music, Mathias Sourbron started at a young age checking out his fathers vinyls. He felt in love with disco, funk & jazz music, like Jackson 5, Motown, etc. Two years later, after hard work, he bought his first pare of turntables and some vinyls of electronic music. \r\nFrom the beginning he was sold to the fact that one guy can make people feel happy about the music, it is a mood manager and the \r\nmusician is in controle of it. It brings people together in a different way. \r\nMathias was first known as part of Dj-duo Spearman Rho. \r\nFunky, jacking house music was their thing. Now three years later after \r\nplaying almost in every part in Flanders, abroad in Spain, he wanted \r\nmore! He has always been interested in sounds and the way they come \r\ntogether. The way a specific sound can make people dance and give them a feeling. Without any music education it was not obvious to learn \r\nto make his own sounds, but it s a hard not life. He developed a passion for more bass, UK funky, garage influenced house music. Nowadays makes now housy tunes, with deep basslines & soulful, RnB-orientated vocals.\r\n\r\nHe already got some nice support. His tracks and mixes have had exposure on divers radio channels like Studio Brussels. He had a major year so far by playing on Tomorrowland, Carpe diem beach (Croatia), Bataplan (Spain) Café d'Anvers, Decadance, etc. Last but not least, he became 3th in the ‘45 toeren’ contest, the big contest of Flemisch brabant (Belgium).\r\n",

His electro sets led him to his finest moment to date when he won the 2005 Diesel:U:Music contest in the category 'Rock, Pop, Electro' in Belgium beating red hot favourites Starski&Tonic (aka The Subs) in a very close sprint... Unlike many of his more 'serious' colleagues, Sigi likes to bring some humour and extra energy to his dj sets. With no productions of his own yet and playing only vinyl, he is one of the few real dj's left! \r\n\r\nSigi's vocabulary includes: bumper stickers, orange, Sweden, Tigra, Sabam, Kreutzfeld, smileys and Electro!After playing for years (since 1998) at a local youthclub and throwing his own parties, in 2004 Sigi got the chance to play at Happy3 and Laundry Day in Antwerp and that was the trigger he needed. He played at Belgian clubs like Petrol, Silo, Spiraal, Kaaiman, Cafe d'Anvers, Botanique, Skate Planet, Vooruit, Branbanthal, Cafe Capital, Cinema, D-club, Industria, Magic Mirror Place, The Zoo, Cirque Central, Den Hemel, Zaal Belgie, Machine, Rumba, Musicafe, Lido, Bunker, Juice, Mirano, Qubus, Entrepot, Decadance, Charlatan, Rector and Culture Club.

  "artist_bio": "Ronny and Renzo, named in deference to two influential giants of the Belgian club scene, are from Antwerp. Mysterious to the last, their early productions came out on Humanity in the '90s before they went into hiding. Nowadays, through their vaunted label King Kung Foo, they make mind-bogglingly slow and intense music for leftfield dancefloors. (Bill Brewster)Dualism. Zarathustra, Plato and Descartes knew a thing or two about it.\r\nIn electronic dance music you will always find traces of the changing relationship between mind and matter, soul and body, man and machine.\r\nAll agree that true power lies in the fusion of these parts.\r\nRonny & Renzo are masters in melding. The dynamics of electronic body music, the hedonistic heyday of new beat, bio-techno connecting Antwerp and Detroit, truly cosmic sounds and rich, dense layers. Always leaving you with something to discover.\r\nTheir standard of perfectionism can get scary, taking months or sometimes even years to find the unique piece of art to complement their sonic journeys. Immaculately mixed, mastered and pressed, no less.\r\nMuch else about this Aries and Capricorn isn't known. Besides inferior little details such as their healthy diet of shredded vinyl, fine Single Malt Scotch Whisky (neat and by the gallon) and marathon work-out studio sessions, most part of it is covered by a veil of secrecy. This level of secrecy is neither a tool nor a trick, it is a necessary condition to create without interference.\r\nRest assured though: they love animals, aliens and humans alike.\r\nTake for instance the name and logo of their vaunted label: King Kung Foo. An expression of their affection for a giant gorilla, martial arts, Smokey Stover and the genius of Tony Clifton. “A name to fear, a name to respect”...or so we like to imagine.",

  "artist_bio": "Actif depuis de nombreuses années sur la scène électronique belge, Sebeing a fait son bout de chemin du coté des platines dans le monde de la nuit.Cela fait déjà pas mal de temps que Sebeing est actif sur la scène électronique belge. En fait, l’histoire a commencé pour lui quand on lui a fait écouter pour la première fois de la New Beat, en 1989. Il est alors directement tombé amoureux de ce nouveau son. Après un nombre incalculable de week-ends passés au Boccaccio et au Café d’Anvers (pour ne citer qu’eux), il s'est mis au djing sous le pseudo Chilling Seb en 1994.\r\n\r\nCe parcours chill out lui a permis d’acquérir une certaine oreille, ce qui l’amena tout naturellement vers la production. Entouré des liégeois les plus motivés de l’époque, c’est sous le nom de 6th Sense Approach qu’il a signé ses premières productions techno. Les tracks du collectif ont quant à elles été signées sur de prestigieux labels tel que Tresor, Rotation, Pure Plastic, Re-load ou encore Bipolar.\r\n\r\nCette aventure les a conduits à se produire à l’étranger (dans le club de dj Hell pour anecdote ou exemple…) Son travail en studio lui a permis de reconsidérer son style en tant que dj. Changement de nom pour un changement de style, Sebeing vit donc le jour avec un style bien personnel. Évoluant dans une house aux sonorités techno, tantôt minimal, tantôt électro... Il berce les clubbers avertis dans une ambiance chaleureuse et festive bien old-school.\r\n\r\nA l’heure actuelle, il serait mal venu de vouloir chiffrer sa collection de disques. Il est même plus prudent de dire qu’elle contient tous les styles depuis le début du mouvement, avec un niveau qualitatif largement au dessus de la moyenne. Son oreille de producteur ne s’est en effet pas éteinte, et c’est ce qui lui permet de toujours être à l’avance sur tout le monde quand on parle d’une nouveauté ou d’une découverte.\r\n\r\nDepuis quelques années maintenant, il possède une critique vinylistique sur www.welovetechno.be et sur www.theclubbing.com. Si vous ne l’avez pas encore entendu, vous pouvez le découvrir ici même en stream...\r\nPour le reste, il se ou s'est produit régulièrement dans les meilleures soirées en Wallonie (Lektroklash, CrashTrain, Crash Test, Club Privé, Fabulous Techno Finds, Festivibe, Electric Science, The Tunnel, Warning, Human Nature, InsideOut Club …).",

  "artist_bio": "Stereo ExpressFew Belgian producers have made such a rapid and significant impact on the electronic music scene as Stereo Express. In less than two years the man has entranced audiences all around the globe, with hits as cult classic \"La Vie En Rose\" or more recently the overwhelming cover of Eurythmics' \"Sweet Dreams\".\r\n\r\nThe present success didn't come accidently. It is the result of hard work and wholehearted commitment to music. Starting as a deejay Stereo Express rapidly enrolled on producing his own tunes. Inspired by Motown soul 80s and 90s pop.\r\n\r\nHe began to define his own musical vision. The second release \"La Vie En Rose\", was already a big hit, but in the end not much more than a foretaste of things to come. The big breakthrough came later, with two massive hits, \"Shadoorack\" and \"Sweet Dreams\". Stereo Express made a clear statement of intent as the two tracks were charted as number one on platforms as Beatport. As a result he got the opportunity to play at clubs and festivals all around the world, from Mexico to Russia.\r\n\r\nToday Stereo Express is at the forefront of a new group of talented producers. Alongside two of his closest friends, Slow Mo and José Noventa, they have decided to form a label. The project got the name 'Love Matters'. The ambition? To enlighten dance floors with love and affection. For that Stereo Express has chosen a different approach on house music. The keywords are 'deep' and 'sexy'. On top of that Chris has given a new touch to his own productions by assembling a live band. With live percussions, vocals and saxophone his performance is now more imposing than ever.\r\n\r\nThe musical switch brought Stereo Express on a journey of reinvention. Driven by passion and knowledge the fire burns more brightly than ever. Without doubt Stereo Express has laid the groundwork for many more years in the spotlight.\r\n\r\nLabels:\r\n\r\nBURLESQUE MUSIQUE / LOVE MATTERS / SHAKER PLATES / PIMPRINELLA\r\n\r\nFor bookings: \r\nbookings@stereo-express.com",

  "artist_bio": "Tomaz is one of the men behind some of the biggest techno hits of the past years (Sunshine on Intec records). On Belgian  national radio Studio Brussel he hosts a weekly techno show with international guests. As a dj he’s been active since age 15. He’s known for his wide selection and knowledge of what has become his passion: MUSIC.Having been raised in the musical surroundings of his father’s record collection – ranging from German schlagers and French chansons to country&western and other golden oldies – Tomaz played his first rock and new wave parties at age 15. Mid 80’s he discovered the first house-tunes at the local shops and it wasn’t long before he took these fresh sounds to parties and local radio shows to learn the public about the new dance craze. Laurent Garnier, Derrick May, Blake Baxter, Jeff Mills… are only a few of the hig profile names with whom Tomaz shared the line-up from the earliest days of his dj’ing career. \r\n\r\nLater on he also went into the studio to produce with people like Filterheadz, Kobbe, Sam Ostyn, David Pereira and Stanny Franssen. “Latin Loopworks” and “Sunshine” (one of the biggest hits on Carl Cox’ label Intec and an instant techno/house classic) conquered the clubscene worldwide. In 2000 he also took one of his big passions (making radio) to a higher level when he became part of the Switch-team on Belgian national radio Studio Brussel, where he programmed and hosted the techno part of that show for ten years.",

  "cover_photo": "",
  "artist_bio": "How to survive in the world of club music, with all its niches and subcultures and its trends changing so rapidly? Go underground, the avant-garde way? Go mad and stop making music all together? Jump ship constantly? Or try to make something more universal and timeless? For their third full-length release, Belgian dance act The Subs decided to make a pop album with heartfelt soul, filmic French retrofuturism and crisp beats. ‘Hologram’ is an album that displays many moods and styles and sees The Subs working together with both renowned international vocalists and underground singers and rappers: Colonel Abrams, Selah Sue, Jean-Pierre Castaldi, Jay Brown and Danny Greene.With two albums under their belt, Jeroen De Pessemier (David Newtron) and Wiebe Loccufier (DJ Tonic) have been touring around the world for five years - London, Barcelona or Sydney, Tomorrowland, Bestival, Lowlands, Les Eurockéennes – you name it. Some major changes took place within the band over the past years. In 2012, songwriter/frontman Jeroen De Pessemier moved to London, absorbing new musical influences there like the UK garage and house revival. After the release of their second album ‘Decontrol’, Wiebe Loccufier started producing beats and evolved from dj into producer. Finally, by recruiting Hadrien Lavogez, The Subs got themselves a genuine multi-instrumentalist with an incredible knack for melody. This whole new dynamic pushed The Subs towards a more pop-based sound for ‘Hologram’.\r\n\r\n‘Trapped’ is a rendition of the 1985 street-smart R&B hit by Colonel Abrams. Urged by that other ‘colonel’, their good friend Mon Colonel of the Liège-based squad The Party Harders, The Subs invited the legendary American singer to Belgium to re-record his vocals. In the end, the original acapella got cleared after all, but Colonel Abram’s visit to Belgium wasn’t entirely unnecessary: he left The Subs with some good stories. Wiebe: ‘One evening during dinner, Colonel Abrams tried to convince us of the fact that he made the first house record: ‘Release the Tension’, a track from 1984 that he recorded with Boyd Jarvis. We don’t know if that actually is true, but it’s a damn good track. And a bold statement!’\r\n\r\nAnother international icon who paid a visit to the Subs-studio is French actor Jean-Pierre Castaldi: one might know this veteran of cinéma from the ‘Astérix’-movies. Castaldi is the deep warm voice that you hear on ‘Concorde’, an upbeat retrofuturistic track that is both an ode to the supersonic wonder of 20th century technology and a love song. Jeroen: ‘Jean-Pierre was an actor, more than a singer, in our studio: he wanted to know precisely what we wanted - we were his ‘directors’. And his rider demanded that we had a bottle of quality bourbon whisky in the studio too (laughs).’\r\n\r\nDeep emotions are laid bare in the bouncy ‘Live in a Dream’ (Selah Sue) and the dreamy triphoppy ‘Fly’ (London-based Jay Brown). Jay Brown is actually VV Brown’s talented younger sister: a singer-songwriter that Jeroen discovered during an open mic night in London. Brown can also be heard in the tracks ‘27’, ‘Under My Skin’, ‘Cling To Love’, ‘The Hand’ and ‘Hologram’. Jeroen: ‘As soon as I stumbled into that pub and saw Jay play her songs on acoustic guitar, I was infatuated with her voice and songs. We used some of her demos on this record and wrote some new songs with her as well.’ Wiebe: ‘With three band members living in different cities, different countries even, this whole album was an email affair: I sent my beats to Jeroen en Hadrien, whose song craft turned them into full-bodied tracks. I never even met Jay before the album was finished! But somehow, that long-distance relationship worked for us.’\r\n\r\nIt worked indeed, as ‘Hologram’ is an album on which The Subs explore both a playfulness and a vulnerability that is new to them. This album is still brimming with energy, but the dark dance-punk of the previous record has been traded for a much more soulful vibe.\r\nWiebe ‘We’ve done five years of very loud music and very specific, really intense live performances: it was time for something else. After our last gigs, I saw it in Jeroen’s eyes: fear of routine. If there’s one thing Jeroen’s not very good at, it’s faking something (laughs).’\r\nJeroen ‘I think it’s only a logical progression: paying more attention to songwriting, melodies, feelings and lyrics. Although there was no concept at all when we started recording a year ago. We didn’t follow any trend.’\r\n‘Wiebe ‘From hiphop to UK house, we absorbed a lot of influences, but this is still Subs-music. We took our time, trusted our gut instinct.’\r\nJeroen ‘That’s why we called the album ‘Hologram’: we like to think of songs as dreams, subliminal ideas, revelations almost.’\r\n\r\nNo more wild nights for The Subs? Think again. ‘The Bottle’ features a monologue by Danny Greene - an underground grime artist Jeroen bumped into in London - that is philosophical, naïve, arrogant, hilarious and funky at the same time. Danny’s soliloquy catapults you right into that afterparty at 7.00 AM, when the hazy dreamy morning light is breaking through the window and the madness of the night is still tangible.\r\n\r\n‘Hologram’ was conceived on an equally intriguing intersection: it’s The Subs most accessible and experimental record to date.",

I had acces to my father's record collection so music became a hobby and a passion. Influenced by the Underground Techno movement, starting with Dave Clarke and Umek, it didn't took long before I had my first cheap dj setup, which learned me the basics of mixing. Fuse club was the biggest inspiration to make the choice of becoming a pro DJ. 12years almost passed and I have been DJ'ing since then, going through various phases to encounter my style of music, which still is Underground Techno. Techno has never been so interesting as today with all the old guys having so much new possibilities and the knowledge of analog producing and mixing. The new guys who really want to do something are free to expose themselves and learn the art of making Techno. It's a very long path, I started producing 2years ago. I am now learning and practicing as much as possible. The Music and having fun are always number one, and I really love what I do. Time for some exposure",

Some say he is the guardian angel of all resident DJ’s, others claim he’s a former airline pilot who crashed an afterparty – some say it’s just an illusion, a well performed hoax.

This skill, her energetic play, mixing tunes to create new ones, cutting, using her own edits, but als the love for Detroit and futuristic inspired music she kept true to and so creating her own sound, she will not leave you untouched…\r\nand yet good is not good enough…. Always exploring for new ways, always looking for new challenges, new inspiration, looking for the never ending future, techniques and sounds, her restless journey keeps on going…. \r\n\r\nBorn in a family with a musical history and a singer as a mom, growing up with a sister and brother who practically raised her with soul and funk music and playing the piano by 9, it's no surprise that by the age of 11 she already knew that she had a tremendous affinity for synthetic sounds and was already dreaming of her first synth. Electronic music it would be and she never lost the microbe.... \r\n\r\nAfter buying records for some time, playing them was only a natural evolution and so her dj-carreer had begun. Her rise began when a friend of hers (Jan Van Den Bergh, one of the people behind Buzz) introduced her to Peter Decuypere (at that time still running Fuse club before venturing out to start I Love Techno). Peter liked what he heard and swiftly made her resident at the Fuse club.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't take long before she started to work for Buzz Records, known as on of the first \"Detroit orientated labels\" in Belgium, as working as a label assistant for Indisc as well. A year later, she decided to broaden her horizon and started to work as A & R manager for R&S Records while at the same time she started with her own label Generations. With 23 releases with names like Steve Rachmad aka Parallel 9, John Tejada, Percy X, Yuji Takenouchi, ... she knew exactly what direction she was going. Soon a second residency at the acclaimed Food club, was added to her activities. She became widely regarded as the Belgian Leading lady of Techno. \r\n\r\nIn 1999 she was asked to create a track for the mixed compilation by Fuse resident Pierre as a bonus track.Together with Raf Bongoma, she produced her first track and so Re-Creation came into excistence. The second record was released in 2002 in a package with a music video and a compilation which made an unexpected huge impact and was followed with a remix for Pragha Khan later that year. A year later she met Sam Ostyn and being on such a high mutual musical frequency there was no coincidence and teaming was a logic movement as given by nature, they have been working together ever since. In 2004 she met Kobbe, a true maestro to her as he teached her a lot and a couple of releases would sprout out of this friendship. Afer having released 2 Chrome Resident EP's, a remix for Jivaro, a remix for Laurent Garnier, releases on Technasia's MiniMaxima label, Laurent Garnier & Eric Morand 's FU..! FCom and MB Elektronics, means she is taking her productions to a new level.So, 2006 became the year of her new solo project and 2007 the launching of her new label Electric Art Recordings! \r\n\r\nSince 2007, starting Electric Art Recordings, hosting the monthly ‘Electric Room’ parties at legendary Fuse Club, uniting a futuristic vision and intergalactic grooves, her mission is all about electrifying grooves into a universal mindframe right on the dancefloor . \r\n\r\nLoving futuristic viewpoints and sounds, hi tech soul metalic grooves, bleeps and strings, melodic techno, minimal, house, electro or techno, Detroit flavoured became her trademark... in short music with a picture and a story, a style that you can hear in her sets and productions.",

  "artist_bio": "Tom Hades, music for life and life for music !! :)Tom Hades started to discover and experiment with electronic music when listening to DAF, Kraftwerk, Front 242, ... At the age of 15, he bought his first keyboard, the famous Casio CZ-101 and transformed his game-computer, Amiga 500, into his first DAW. Quickly he got experienced with MIDI-integration and sampling functions, which gave him even more urge for buying/selling new material as addition to his current setup. During the same period, his old schoolfriend, RedHead, was co-producing with Marco Bailey. He got in contact with Marco too which led them in 2000 to their first co-release. And this was the start of a big period of releases, included the anthem of \"I Love Techno\" in 2001. Have a look at the discography for the complete overview ... In the same year as I Love Techno, Tom started to do live performances. He got more & more experienced and started to play all over the world. His live performance was fully appreciated in countries like Spain, Colombia, Brazil, France, Poland, Sweden, Mexico, Japan, Austria, Italy, Norway, Ireland, ... and on many known festivals like Nature One, I Love Techno, City Parade, ... In the first period of 2002, Tom also produced his first solo release. In the next 3-4 years he continued to produce tracks on his own as well as his co-production with Marco on respected labels like MB Elektronics, Pornographic Recordings, Rhythm Convert, Northwest Dynamics, Invasion, Fine Audio, Patterns, Lupp, ... In 2004, they decided it was time to take the next step, start a label. And so Rhythm Convert was born. Initially, the purpose of the label was to give an opportunity to new talents to release their stuff. Guys like Axel Karakasis, Spiros Kaloumenos, Veztax, ... did a very good job to show the people what is was all about. Nowadays, the label is more aimed to produce electro-techno tracks and less oriented towards loopy techno sounds. End 2004, they released their full album, Rude Boy, caused a stirr all over the world. The best proof was their live performance during Nature One @ Pydna were they literally \"blew the place to kingdom come\" ! His current releases on labels like MB Elektronics & Rhythm Convert are oriented in the same way his musical taste changes, more melodic and even sometimes more dramatic music with flavors of techno, minimal, tekhouse and electro. Nowadays, Tom is busy at concentrating in his next step, to develop his \"dj-career\". In the near future, you can expect dj-sets with dedication and filled with energy, as known from his live-sets, to give his fans the pleasure of clubbing ! But as every self-respected artist, he will never forget his roots, so live-sets will still be part of his main occupation ! In the means of productions, future releases will certainly be done, as well as a second album together with Marco. So keep your eyes open on some new productions, because they will certainly surprise lots of people !!! \r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Formerly known as The Glimmer Twins, this duo was forced to change their name due to the fact that their old name was the same as one often used by Jagger & Richards of the Rolling Stones.BORN\r\nM: 1970. In Ghent, Belgium.\r\nB: 1969. In Ghent, Belgium.\r\n\r\nFAMILY\r\nM: There was a bit of music in the house, a bit of African music, Arabic music and Michael Jackson. But we had a lot of radio and recording tapes from the radio when I was 10-years-old or something. The jukebox in my parents’ bar was owned by a company that delivered 7 inches, whenever they replaced the selection we got to keep what they took out..They were all scratched and had played on the jukebox 100-times already. But it was still cool to have those to play around with and listen to.\r\nB: My parents used to have Clubs and DJ Bars in the late 70s in Ghent. My father was the DJ, he played a lot of Rock and Seventies stuff. I remember at the age of 8 I saw him playing records. I wanted to do that as well! My love for music and dj-ing definitely started there.\r\n\r\nMUSICAL ROOTS\r\nM: The first 7-inch I bought with my own money was Tainted Love by Soft Cell, we still have it in our record collection.\r\nBy the age of 11, I frequently visited my Aunt in Amsterdam and I remember the music on the radio was brilliant.. I recorded a lot of tapes there and on one of those tapes there is a track, that to this day, I still haven’t found out what it is – I only know that at that time I had a great feeling about it and I hope that one day I’ll bump into it so I will finally be able to rest.\r\nB: Mostly popular music, the stuff that the local radio was playing. I remember buying my first 7-inches in the early 80s, Rockwell for example . Then the Break Dance and Electro Boogie hype came over from New York. Movies like Beat Street and Wild Style were available on VHS and I saw them maybe a hundred times. My friends were into the breakdancing, but I was more interested in the musical part. I started buying the records and started imitating the scratches by DST or Flash. From those days on, you could say that I was really bitten by the music bug.\r\n\r\nDJING\r\nM: We have been DJing for about 20-years now. Early November 1987 was really our professional nightlife debut. We started playing in a club for 300-people, called Fifty Five. A small, dark, medieval basement with a HUGE soundsystem. We played there every Saturday from 10pm till 8/9am. Throughout the night we had to play really different sorts of music because at 10 o’clock all the youngsters came in and wanted to hear the new beat and pop stuff, but then a couple of hours later the audience changed – the more experienced clubbers came so we had to change the music – and then at the end it was the old rockers coming in, sipping whiskeys at the bar having us playing the Rolling Stones.\r\nB: It was an extremely good learning school and I think that is really the foundation of how we play now and how Ghent got its sound. We were so focussed on covering the whole musical landscape as much as possible, pleasing everybody who came in, however we had 10-11 hours to prove ourselves, compared to having only one-and-a-half - two-hours sets nowadays.\r\n\r\nESKIMO\r\nM: Eskimo started out organizing parties in an old underwear factory. The parties were very successful, attracting more than 7000 people at its peak! There were five different rooms; a ragga/RnB room, another more housy room, a drum and bass room, an all-weird-cocktailmusic-60s–stuff-with–everything-mingled-in room. It was very diverse and you had a lot of different styles of people coming in. Everybody could go to their favourite room or could bounce from one room to another. It was a very successful approach, especially in a small city like Ghent. It had a good vibe.\r\nB: NEWS then approached us to make a compilation, an Eskimo compilation. We thought that was great idea and in 2000 we did our first. It was quite successful, even getting great reviews in UK magazines. Then we did the second one, third one, fourth one.. We did 8 Eskimo compilations in total. We then started inviting different artists to do compilations and soon afterwards singles started to be released as well and by then Eskimo had become a label, releasing artist singles and albums.\r\n\r\nWhen did you guys start seeing music as a profession?\r\nB: We don’t see it as a profession. We don’t work.\r\nM: We are unemployed. We just play music.\r\n\r\nLABELS & PRODUCTION\r\nM: We started remixing a few years ago. Something that has built up very nicely over the years. The last ones we did were Freddy Mercury and Roxy Music, and currently we are doing Snow Patrol.\r\nB: The last compilation we did was DJ Kicks which was released in April 2005. In the meantime we started to produce our own music. We’ve been working and jamming with different musicians, different producers and we are releasing all those jams on our own label called Diskimo.\r\nM: We’re indies now! But we work really lo-fi. The records look like bootlegs. It’s good fun to release your own music. We don’t do promotion, we don’t even send CDR’s out.\r\nB: We’ve had great times at Eskimo, and it was amazing being part of it. Now Dirk is doing a great job with the label and we will be doing a new thing on Eskimo somewhere in Spring 2007.\r\n\r\nDJING\r\nM: It is very nice to play on something very underground for 150-people on a Friday, and then be playing for a crowd of 10,000 on a Saturday. We will play totally different sets. The set for 150 people will be much more intimate whereas the other one will be much more energetic. Playing at all these different kinds of gigs and different audiences keeps us alert musically and it keeps us sounding fresh. If we always had to play the same kind of music, the same kind of sound, we would be bored.\r\nB: We like to change and play for different crowds. We really don’t know what we are going to do beforehand, we just arrive with our recordings and we see who else is playing and what the vibe is like and we’ll create our set so that fits in there. It’s the audience which decides how far we can go.\r\n\r\nFABRIC\r\nM: The first time we played at Fabric was on my birthday, 13 December 2003. Almost three years ago. It was a great atmosphere.\r\nB: We had played at The End and Plastic People and a number different clubs and venues in London but not Fabric, and it was great to be there on a Friday night. FabricLive. We fitted in there. It was working.\r\nM: It is always very nice to be able to play on the best equipment around. It is so well organised it suits the name – Fabric.\r\nB: If you’re playing Spain or France or wherever, everybody knows Fabric and everybody looks at the website to see who is playing, who is on the CDs, whatever. So I think that it is an institution that a lot of people in Europe and beyond look at.\r\nM: But also the way they approach a night, it is amazing to see such a big club every week, Friday and Saturday, with such an underground line-up… and it works. People know what to expect and I think that Fabric has enough power to promote the different acts that they like. They present to the people “look, this is what we like, this is what we have at Fabric, have a listen.” People come and they accept that. I don’t think there is a club anywhere else in the world who is doing this week after week after week.\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE\r\nB: Well, FabricLive is another step into our future. We’ll continue DJing all over the world, which is nice. Meanwhile we’ll be releasing a lot of stuff on our own label and seeing how that goes.\r\nM: Every month, every five-weeks, we will have a 12-inch coming out on Diskimo We have loads of stuff lined up already. So that‘s a lot of music being put available. And somewhere early next year, we’ll do something new on Eskimo.\r\n\r\nBio courtesy of fabric",

Two Times Four!\r\n\r\nThe result is not only fun to look at, it also allows them to develop their own unique sound. Two Times Four not only stands for the amount of tracks they often tend to blend into one seamless mix, it also stands for the fact that they hit you twice as hard as any other Techno act you’ve heard before.\r\n\r\nWe don’t like to use the word banger often, but that’s exactly what these guys are going to give you, banger after banger. This hasn’t gone unnoticed and resulted in Two Times Four playing at some of the biggest festivals and clubs around such as Mysteryland, Defqon1, Café D’anvers and many more.\r\n\r\nThe future is bright for Two Times Four, that’s the least you can say.

They took as their base music of all types : Tauba and Louise were always surrounded by Jazz, Rock, Electro, Pop at Home while they were growing up.\r\n\r\nThey studied musical theory and played traditional instruments like violin, piano and accordion, they studied fashion, devoured films and serials. A few artistic studies later, Tauba studied communication while Louise went into graphic art and later became a make up artist. They met in Brussels and began to organise events together, gaining a lot of success and having a lot of fun on the way.\r\n\r\nThey take part in and organise fashion shows with designers, photographers, models, in short a whole generation of creativeness and fun at their side. The Lizzies still worked together in the event creation field and organise sets and live performances by groups. And their fame is spreading throughout the country and beyond.\r\n\r\nFor the live act the girls are supported by Antoine DkA on stage, their producer.\r\n\r\nAudiences love Antoine’s wild performances on stage and it was this inhibition and magic that The Lizzies loved in their search for someone to produce their music.\r\n\r\nAntoine has played the saxophone for many years and like Tauba and Louise had a classical training. He is the consummate musician, as much at home on the machines producing electro music as keyboards and drums. The three members of the group work hard and coherently. They see each other regularly the girls write the songs and Antoine sees to instrumentalising the music In production Antoine interprets the themes of Louise and Tauba’s songs with sensitivity and subtlety.",

He dropped out of the conservatorium and while everyone around him needed a pc to chat or play online games, He saved up his money to buy a old pc just for his music production and ever since then its been a bigger part of his life. \r\nMost of the time he made bootlegs and remixes for his dj aquantences, untill one of them said that he should go professional and release his own music. \r\nOnce he released a few of his tracks in the progressive genre under Purple Edge Records and also some remixes for some commercial groups like La Luz, He quickly realised that this wasnt his scene. Always facinated by Funky House and Tech-House music he desided to make the genre he enjoyed the most. \r\nThese day's he releases music under the Push It Records Label and working on some remixes for other label company's. Spreading his passion for the music he loves so he can share it with the whole world. He is supported by Oleg Flame (New York) and Worda (Sarajevo). A few years have gone by spinning records, while mostly playing for local party's and for smaller clubs. He has been known to blow the roof off of people's party's.",

In his teenage years he started out listening and spinning records. \r\nAfter picking up the basics of the production process, he soon developed a real passion for music creation. \r\n\r\nThomas forms part of the Aquila psytrance project with whom he released a full album in 2009 at Dacru Records. He didn't only gain a lot of experience in the production process, but also performed in places like Japan, Israel, Russia, Italy, France and all over Europe.\r\n\r\nAlways seeking new challenges he felt the urge to move into progressive house. Not a bad choice, because his productions were soon picked up by Blue Tunes from Germany. The track Wild Silence was released in a Jochem Peterson EP, including a smashing Neelix remix. And later on by Atmosphere Records, where he got to do more cooperations and EP releases together with Jochem Peterson. Further remixing artists include Andrea Bertolini and Antix. In 2011 Tom Hill will also release a solo EP with Atmosphere Records.",

In 2006,They cocreated the double Dirty dancing complilation “histoire d’amour”on wich appears the undo(factorcity records)remix of their hit “wake up”.After that,they remixed the track “Autounno” from Margot(kraftmusic) with a certain success.

In my beloved Brussels, I promote the ARNOLD nights at Club La Vilaine and am a regular dj at Bar des Amis. Also, I am a proud resident of the house room at the infamous Ghent based Vlammenwerper nights.",

Felix was more oriented minimal, tech house, techno and retro, while Pietro was more electro house.\r\n\r\nWhile both born in the 90s, so they experienced the evolution of electronic music very closely. They were mixing each of their side when they met, Pietro was then interested more closely to the music of Felix ie tech house, techno and deep house.\r\n \r\nFelix himself had already done part of the way as a composer by the name of Sampay and had already pulled some tracks on some labels like Ban-off Music, Blackwall Records, when he finally decided to devote himself entirely to composition. Pietro then just ask him for advice on buying instruments.\r\n\r\nThat's how the two friends have put himself at the composition and ended up spending a lot of time both to share their knowledge and Ableton instruments such as the new AIRA kit Roland.\r\n\r\nAfter many months and many hours of studio, they form their duet \"The Great Minds\" and end up signing an EP on the Ban-off Music label.\r\n\r\nBiographie The Minds Great\r\n \r\nFelix & Pietro deux gars de Baudour (Mons) ont commencé la musique à l’age de 15 ans chacun de leur coté avec des styles bien différents. Felix était plus orienté minimal, tech house, techno et retro, tandis que Pietro était plutôt electro house. \r\n\r\nTout deux nés dans les années 90, ils ont donc connu l’evolution de la musique électronique de très près. Ils mixaient chacun de leur coté quand ils se sont rencontrés, Pietro s’est alors intéressé de plus prés à la musique de Felix c’est à dire la tech house, la techno et la deep house. \r\n \r\nFelix, lui, avait déjà fait un bout de chemin en tant que compositeur sous le nom de Sampay et avait déjà sortit quelques tracks sur quelques labels comme Ban-off Music, Blackwall Records, quand il decide enfin de se consacrer entièrement à la composition. Pietro vient alors lui demander des conseil sur des instruments à acheter.\r\n\r\nC'est comme ça que les deux amis se sont mît à la composition et on fini par passer beaucoup de temps à deux à partager leurs connaissances sur ableton et sur des instruments tels que le nouveau kit AIRA de Roland. \r\n\r\nAprès de nombreux mois et de longues heures de studio,ils forment leur duo « The Minds Great » et finissent par signer un Ep sur le label Ban-off Music.",

Pioneer of new sounds, always looking for new adventures? Passionately so, to the point of madness even.\r\n \r\nWhen not playing parties and festivals worldwide Mathieu can be found working through the night in his studio both on his own hard hitting House productions, as championed by the likes of people from Brodinski to , collaborating with artists like US Rapper Miss Eaves on releases for label’s like Buraka Som Sistema’s Enchufada, or remixing acts such as Morcheeba, Telex and Matt & Kim.\r\n \r\nA tireless champion of new music, Mathieu’s own Forma.T parties have bought some of the biggest names in electronic music, such as Justice, Rusko, Boyz Noize, Diplo, James Blake and Sebastian, to Belgium whilst the Forma.T label meanwhile has released artists (like as Kolombo, Panteros666, Bad Dancer and AKS) from around the world. Mathieu is also in charge of alternative festival, Dour Festival, and the head of Forma.T stage at Tomorrowland.\r\n\r\n \r\nSurfing Leons can be listened to at 3:00 pm on the sofa or at 3:00 am in a club. Surfing Leons is clearly house-oriented, in the way Berlin and London are speaking it. Surfing Leons is a playground clash between the old and the new school. In short, Surfing Leons is the music of yesterday, the music of today and most definitely the music of tomorrow.",

  "artist_bio": "Let me be clear.\r\nWho I am, where I come from or what I look like is no were near as important as the music that I bring and try to represent. \r\n\r\nIf there should be anything on the forefront, it should be the sounds of the music and nothing less.\r\nLet me be clear.\r\nWho I am, where I come from or what I look like is no were near as important as the music that I bring and try to represent. \r\n\r\nIf there should be anything on the forefront, it should be the sounds of the music and nothing less.\r\n\r\nThen what about the music? You ask.\r\n\r\nWell, I fell in love with music long before I even thought of mixing or making it.\r\nIt all started of with listening to hip-hop music (Wu-tang Clan, Gang Starr, Big L, Public Enemy, KRS-one, Funk master flex, Run DMC, Grand master flash).\r\n\r\nThat’s how the love for turntables and vinyl started. Then one day I stumbled upon the old record collection of my dad. It was all tucked away in the basement. So I started to check out all the old records and started to expand my musical taste and embraced genres like blues, jazz, trip-hop and techno. But the longer I focused on electronic music, the harder it was to resist. So I started spinning some records at a friend’s house.\r\n\r\nThe turntables worked like a drug. I became addicted. By the summer of 2008 I had enough money saved to buy my own equipment. But I had no idea of what style I was getting into or what genre to play.\r\n\r\nSo I started digging in the history of electronic music. After learning the history and foundation of Techno music, I could relate to the Detroit style. Seeing the hip-hop cuts and elements reflecting in the Detroit techno and everything else that was possible with the music, my mind was made up!\r\n\r\nAnd on that note, we will end with a quote:\r\n“I am nothing in comparison to the music” – Mike Banks\r\n\r\n",

Both from Luxembourg and both djing and producing together as 'The Criime' since 2009. Influenced by north american and north european house / deep house / acid house music.The Criime is the brainchild of the young Luxembourgish/Italian duo formed by Andrea Mancini and Fabio Picariello. The pair had been close friends since ever and have joined forces in the studio in december 2009. What motivated them to start The Criime was the wide-raging love for contemporary dance especially the ever changing spheres of house music. \r\n\r\nSoon they got in contact with Helsinki's club-music label TopBillin, a label which has brought EP's from ClubCheval and Manaré to name a few, who brought their first EP 'Fidji' out end of january 2011. 'Fidji' - EP has been a mixture of some techno house influences from warm days. The EP has been blogged and played a lot and they gained on attention in the scene. \r\n\r\nThe duo has recently released a free track, JackyFive, on Discobelle, which is a nice deep house edit of jackson five's 'I'll be there' ; again this track had a good success.\r\nBoth recently got back into work and more and more influenced by the US and German House / Techno scene which you can notice in their latest sets and tracks. Both are a perfect mixture of warm intelligent and groovy house music. \r\n\r\nBoth have finished remixes for Top Billin , Get Flavor Records and are preparing their second EP and assure that they will surprise everyone : this will be yet another inspired chapter in the story of these young talents.",

Feel My Bicep already asked him to do a mix for their blog, and charted 'Do You Love' on their house selection for 22tracks London. Will Saul also named Supreems in his top five favourite emerging artists. He is also part of the first LL.M compilation released on the Cologne based label Noorden, which can be found here https://noorden.bandcamp.com/album/ll-m-001",

Together with some of her closest friends who share the same passion for music, she started ‘Lab.105dB’, after one year they've hosted a stage at Forest Festival and a concept Strictly Techno was born...TRiXY got noticed and was booked on several events and some well-known clubs. \r\nFrom Tomorrowland (Coincidence Stage) to Chronicles and from Decadance to Lost Theory, she has perfected her typical sound blending dark, deep Techno sounds with some oldskool elements and hints of Acid.\r\n\r\nWith her four deck Techno sets she manages to send energy levels through the roof where ever she goes. It has taken her to all sorts of venues with an ever growing following of devoted fans and enthousiasts. Add her infamous party stamina to the equation and you will know why she is rapidly becoming a rising talent in Belgian nightlife.  \r\n\r\nCurrently you can see her perform regularly at her home base Decadance and on various events where she is often re-invited, a testament of her skill and determination.",

With his degree in hand, he embarked for Chicago. The authenticity of the Windy Citys personal and musical encounters convinced his heart and soul that he had to realize himself through and for the Music.\r\n\r\nThomas infuses many different musical genres into his specific breed of electronica. If you have not caught one if his live performances or DJ sets, you might then enjoy listening to his original works and/or remixes which have been released by such labels as Missive Music, Timid Records, Night Drive Music and Vokuhila.\r\n\r\nThomas exposes himself to new music night & day, and puts together and rebuilds the very equipment he records with. His calling is to always evolve, in everything, and to create soundscapes that are rooted within the foundation of universal understanding ...",

Born in 1985 on the musical axis of Ghent-Brussels, and with music strengthening its grip on him, he soon found his way to the record stores at the age of 18, setting off on becoming a reputed dj but soon evolving towards the production side of things. Tom developes an interest in a wide spectrum of music styles, but consumed by the strength, power and instinctive structure of techno, that music would control him up to now.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 he gave birth to his debut EP that immeditately blasted its way into the playlist of several a-list dj's worldwide. His unique blend of bumping minimal techno with huge influences of oldschool chicago and acidhouse landed him a release on Marco Bailey's MB Selektions in that same year. Soon followed by releases on Andre Crom's Heimatmelodie imprint, PsyTox' label Coincidence, and again MB Selektions where his track \"Octopussy\" scorched the feet of dancefloor punters all over the globe. He also performs his material live enabling him to turn up the energy levels a notch further. In his records he tries to blend in old school drum elements into a subtle environment of new slinky grooves and all-out raving madnesshave, which attracted the attention of top DJs.\r\n\r\nHis production skills, time shifting rhythm patterns and funky complex melody's are very highly appreciated by the crowd and promotors.\r\n\r\nHe received much acclaimed support from people like Richie Hawtin, Josh Wink, Camea, James Zabiela, Marco Bailey, Ambivalent, Gabriel Ananda, Seth Troxler, Dominik Eulberg, Skoozbot, André Crom, Fabrizio Maurizi,...\r\n\r\nHe has played dj and livesets in venues and events such as Kozzmozz, Ultra, Heimatmelodie, Forbidden Fruit, Déclic, Minimalicious, SeSSioN and performed in clubs & venues like Tresor (Berlin), U60311 (Frankfurt), Fuse (Brussels), Vooruit (Ghent), Kiosk Club (Lille), Aquarium (London), Club Versteck (Dortmund), Silo, Decadance, Make-up Club, Panoptikum (Kässel), Montini and Escape Concept.\r\n\r\nPicking up a montly residency in Frankfurt's U60311 and maintaining his local position on the SeSSioN parties in Aalst, you can expect future releases on Trapez, Heimatmelodie, Toysforboys and Veryverywrongindeed, and a series of groundbreaking remixes on various labels.",

When they first met, Chantal was working at Extreme, At The Villa and Fuse; Florence was working for Out Soon - Belgium's leading dance music magazine (now it's called NightCode by the way). As you can see: electronic music is and always has been more than a passion for both of them. \r\n\r\nOpen-minded as they are, you can't pigeonhole them in one style or scene. Every set is different and takes you on a journey through many styles and emotions. Their basic rule? To give the party people a night they won't forget! \r\n\r\nThe most interesting thing about the Jelly Bellies is without doubt the complicity between the two. They challenge each other to keep things interesting and fun for both the audience and themselves as a duo.\r\n\r\n2008 was a breakthrough year for The Jelly Bellies, playing various festivals and parties in Liège, Ghent, Antwerp and Brussels, and of course: The City Parade (I Love Techno truck). Chantal and Florence aren’t only fun to watch, they also know how to play. People who saw them spin records in various legendary Belgian clubs, can and will confirm.\r\n\r\nLast year The Jelly Bellies confirmed they're a kick-ass DJ-duo with gigs at Café d'Anvers, City Parade, Bruxelles Les Bains, Laundry Day, Libertine Supersport, Mirano, Musicafé, Tour&Taxis, Decadance, Mekitburn, Piknik Elektronik, Charlatan, Wood and many other great parties and clubs. 2011 started with an international residency in Etik Club (Lille, FR) and they also have a bi-monthly residency at the KetaLoco parties in Fuse. The cherry on the cake is of course the invitation to play at Tomorrowland this summer.\r\n\r\nTo make things short, the sky is the limit for The Jelly Bellies! \r\n\r\n\r\nQuote from fans: 'The Jelly Bellies , 2 frisse bloempjes maar dat barsten van energie! Dat kan niet anders dan overslaan naar het volk dit met behulp van hun dynamieke muziek. Ge kent ze zelf , ze zullen weer hun uiterste best doen. Grote zaal zal eruit zien zoals een uit de hand gelopen kerncentrale.... geloof me die vrouwen zijn radioactief! '\r\n\r\n\r\n'Gisteren een beestige set gespeeld in de FUSE!! Hard van genoten!'\r\n\r\n'Awesome set last night! Thanks'\r\n\r\n'MERCI POUR CE WEEK-END DE FOLIES !!'",

  "artist_bio": "Ultrasone is Igor Vicente and Vernon BaraWith records on Visionquest, Hot Creations and Guy Gerber's Supplement Facts, Ultrasone is one of Belgium's fastest rising house duos. The group is made up of Vernon Bara and Igor Vicente. Both met years ago in their hometown of Mons, but until recently took different paths. Bara got his feet wet as a producer, releasing dozens of tracks and DJing in clubs around Europe. Vicente, while notching up international gigs as well, became a player in Belgium's club scene, DJing at top tier venues like Fuse and Silo, and eventually founding one of Ghent's finest parties: Wildfamily at Decadence. The series became one of Belgium's main outposts for underground house and techno––their first guest was Jamie Jones, just after his debut EP dropped on Freak n' Chic, and since then they've hosted dozens of equally essential artists, including the likes of Seth Troxler and Guy Gerber.   \r\n\r\nAfter years of leading parallel lives, Bara and Vicente realized their shared love of modern club sounds and started working together, officially forming Ultrasone in 2011. It's safe to say they started strong: their first track, \"Don't Feel No Way,\" came out on Visionquest’s Club Collection (Spring Summer 2011) in June, and was included on Seth Troxler’s In the Lab mix, Maya Jane Cole’s Feel the Future mix for DJ Mag, and Space Ibiza’s official closing fiesta compilation. A few months later, Troxler passed along one of their songs to Jamie Jones, who released it on Hot Creations. The EP was called Breathe N Pop, and right away it shot up the Beatport tech house charts––the B-side, “Spiral Reserve,” hit #18, and the title track made it all the way to #1, no small feat for a duo less than a year old.  \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Guy Gerber had wanted to release Ultrasone's music ever since Vicente showed him a demo at Kazantip. They gave him Here and So Far, an EP with three of their most mature productions yet. Driving, melodic and almost dreamlike at times, the record shows Ultrasone’s subtle artistic touch as well as their club sensibility, confirming them as one of the most promising new duos out there today. \r\n\r\n",

Endorsments from the likes of Erol Alkan and Aeroplane. A few festival slots and high profile club bookings. But still, when, sometime in back end of 2010, Villa started to tiptoe into their modest corner of the limelight, it was still a project into its growing pains. Originally rooted from the DJ partnership of Ghent duo Thang & Fredo, it wasn't until the former spend some time in the home studio of his long-time buddy Francois Demeyer that the definite shape of Villa is drawn up. \r\n\r\nMany moons ago, these boys rubbed shoulders in the short-lived local band Foxylane, but while Thang's well developing DJ ambitions took him elsewhere, Francois followed his own path - which lead to being part of the line up of Belgian's fashion darlings Vive La Fête, hooking up with The Glimmers for Disko Drunkards and crafting soulful poptunes with his own band Soapstarter.\r\nNow, the decades long club experience from Thang, matched with multi-instrumentalist Francois' well honed studio skills are a match made in disco heaven! Right? \r\n\r\n“Right!”, says Francois. “Disco is at the core of Villa, but we don't want to be confined by endless arpeggios and other cosmic trickery. There's so much more sounds out there, endless shades of disco to toy with.” His cohort agrees: “Everything we put out there must have a heart, an organic groove, a soul; anything to make it hit you where it matters. That comes first and foremost - we'll leave the labeling to the bloggers”. “Although we'd love to coin the phrase 'hyper-disco'!”, Francois jumps in laughingly. \r\nAll jokery aside, the online community will be happy to know that the pair are currently working on there 2nd EP, but first they unleash a bundle of impressive remixes, beginning with their hyper charged rework of The Human League's 'Night People'. Also be sure to watch out for Villa's anthemic take on Adele's 'Rolling In The Deep', a rework of Yeasayer's 'I Remember' that sounds like it's born out of a cloud of grilled mushrooms (the good kind), and their Deep Space Nine-ish remodeling of Digitalism's 'Blitz'. \r\n\r\nIt took a few years for these two buds to discover their creative compatibility, but as Villa they're off with a flying start. Keep your eye on the sky. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWritten by Jonas Boel",

  "artist_bio": "The first contact Wahnsinn had with music would be a very long time ago. But if you ask him what artists he likes the most in his younger years, his answer would be the king of pop Michael Jackson or a piano genius like Wim Mertens. It’s no use to say that these artists were and still are very influential to anyone that knows them and loves music. Everyone has to start their love for music somewhere, and for Wahnsinn it started here.In 2005, he started to spin vinyl records. Just for fun, and to develop his technical skills as a DJ. House, retro, minimal were the styles that made the entrance to the ears of Wahnsinn. Mixing and performing as a DJ continued like this for him until 2008. From then on, until now-ish, a pause encountered the short DJ-career of him. The reason was clear: playing music just wasn’t enough, he needed to evolve into an artist that was more complete. In other words, this meant he was focusing on making his own stuff. Producing music, while being in search of the style he wanted to excel in. Being a producer is a work that is in constant development, and that same fact applied to Wahnsinn. \r\n\r\nToday, the style that he produces and plays is techno. While he discovered the bits of past techno gods, and the new talents that appear in to this world, he felt a huge attraction to this genre. This kind of music has been around for so many years, and the godfathers of techno are still here and performing everywhere in the world. Wahnsinn just wants to be a part of this movement, which is rich of so many influences and people, and obviously, he wants to leave his trademark to the people.\r\n\r\nHe’s got many assets as a performer. Playing with vinyl or CDJ’s is a part of his skill set, but nowadays, performing digitally is his preference. Keeping creativity in mind, and maxing out the set of tools that are available results in a perfect synergy of madness and music. After seeing a performance of Wahnsinn, one will remember the energy and the passion that he had put into his mix. Reflecting utter madness to the people is not a result of his performance, it’s a goal. \r\n\r\nWahnsinn is the German translation of madness. Take madness together with music, and you’ll get techno.",

  "artist_bio": "Umlaut:\r\nThe umlaut characters are created on a computer by using ASCII key sequences.\r\nHolding the \"Alt\" key down whilst typing in the code for the required character.\r\n\r\nUnless you still believe in fairy tales, we could tell you to hold \"Alt\" and David and Johan would appear to tell them their biography themselves...\r\n\r\nBut we won't do that.April 2011. After living for almost a year in a country without a government, rules or any ethics, Umlaut sprouted as the brainchild of electronic music madmen David Gorez and Johan De Vylder.\r\nWhile both of them already played alone for many years, they felt it was time for someting new, something fresh! Umlaut was born.\r\n\r\nAs they were still spinning vinyl while spending half of their paycheck at the online recordstore, they definitely had a passion in common.\r\nFeeling the vinyl in your hands, picking them out of your recordbag to putting them on the turntable, it's simply something different then scrolling through the titles on the keypad of your laptop...\r\nDon't get us wrong, evolution is nice...unless it affects the quality of the sound.\r\n\r\nSeeing, feeling and experiencing the evolution of electronic music in Belgium from the mid 90's till now, is like being part of today's scene since the beginning. As both players where part of this movement from the start, raving all over Belgium for more then a decade, they simply couldn't get enough of this.\r\nAnd still can't!\r\n\r\nDavid and Johan both started playing records around 1998 and stood behind the decks at many clubs and venues in Belgium and beyond the borders. David as dj Nocif, Johan as Juannes. They first met in 2006, as Johan organised his Plus/Minus events where he invited David to play. Since then they never lost contact and shared their mutual interest, music and parties, with Brussels as a central meeting point. Juannes became resident of the infamous P3P parties in Brussels and played as a regular guest at Fuse club Brussels, Kozzmozz, Ultra in Gent and Tomorrowland. Nocif played as a resident for Bombomatic, Technoir and Artfact, while playing twice at Laundry Day and having a spot at the 10 years Kozzmozz party. Next to that he went abroad in Germany and twice in Switzerland. David is also promotor of the all known Fuse club in Brussels, where he's hosting world's best parties!\r\n\r\nInspired by all different styles of electronic music, you can expect a musical voyage from soft house music to harder techno music, going back and then forward again.\r\nAlways keeping in mind we don't want to bring music for the masses, but cast pearls before the dancefloor swines. Or only aim is to make you smile and keep you dancing all night, or at least during our set.\r\n\r\nUmlaut to that!",

  "artist_bio": "From politically incorrect prog-rock to funky r&b, from trendy hiptrop to banging German techno, ja: if it gets a booty going, the Dewaele brothers have it in their record collection. In times where moms give their sons and daughters DJ-courses for their birthdays and bootlegging has become an Olympic sport, it is nice to see a record that sets a new standard in the genre of mix-albums: ‘2 Many DJ’s’ from Belgian groove-gurus Soulwax.\r\n\r\nFans of quality left-of-centre rock music will know Soulwax from their highly acclaimed album ‘Much Against Everyone’s Advice’, which made it into the British Top 40 and got rave responses in Japan and Australia. But there’s much more to the two brothers than meets the eye. Apart from being chairman of the Belgian Carpenters Association (Stephen) and having a black belt in tae kwon do (David), they are also masters in blending the finest products of music history together into a catchy, hilarious and -above all- intriguing groove exploration. From politically incorrect prog-rock to funky r&b, from trendy hiptrop to banging German techno, ja: if it gets a booty going, the Dewaele brothers have it in their record collection. \r\n\r\nBlending beautiful tunes is far from new for the Soulwax brothers. Back in the dark days of 1999, David and Stephen started a DJ-show on Belgian national radio, called ‘Hang The DJ’, where they did exactly that. Years before bootlegging reached the trendy pages of The Face, they were already making their own mixes for inclusion on the show. Inspired by the philosophy of one Grandmaster Flash, they cut together the best bits of funky tracks into an even funkier mix. It was then that classic mixes of Blackstreet with Grandmaster Flash, Beck with Prodigy and Beastie Boys vs. Herbie Hancock with INXS vs. AC/DC saw the light of day. Praise the Lord.\r\n\r\nAfter having wooed Belgian and Dutch crowds for a few years with these eclectic sets, they went on to impress the most cynical part of the world, the London scene, a loud yet harmless species. The British capital, where approximately 67% of the population (including 17% of women over 65) owns two decks and a mixer, is used to a thing or two, but Stephen and David immediately raised quite a few eyebrows with sparkling sets for London’s independent radio station Xfm, national institution BBC Radio 1 and appearances at the renowned Trash nights in London and Arthur Baker’s Sunday Sessions in The Elbow Room.\r\n\r\nImpact on the trendometer: a fat 9.5. “When we played our first set for Xfm”, says David, “several club owners phoned up during the transmission to ask us to come and play their venues.” And when an (unnamed) DJ played Soulwax’s classic bootleg mix of Skee-Lo’s ‘I Wish’, Survivor’s ‘Eye Of The Tiger’ and The Breeders’ ‘Cannonball’ at a London club night and pretended he was mixing it himself, it became official: Soulwax was hot property. Even Jarvis Cocker showed his appreciation for their skills and none other than über-producer Felix Da Housecat invited the brothers to collaborate on his new project: a girlband called Glamarama. You gotta believe it…\r\n\r\nNo surprise then that ‘2 Many DJ’s’ has been in the pipeline for yonks, but because getting tracks cleared is a legal war zone, it has taken quite a bit longer. “Mick Jones from The Clash was very impressed with our bootleg version of their ‘The Magnificent Seven’ mixed with Basement Jaxx’s ‘Romeo’”, explains Stephen, “but still we didn’t manage to secure the rights to include it on the album”. Rumours that two lawyers have been decapitated since are unconfirmed.\r\nToo bad, but there’s more than enough magic material to keep you intrigued, smiling and shaking. The record includes already renowned mixes like Destiny’s Child’s ‘Independent Women’ with 10CC’s ‘Dreadlock Holiday’ and Stooges’ ‘No Fun’ with Salt ‘N’ Pepa’s ‘Push It’, but it also features new beautiful blends like Röyksopp’s ‘Eple’ with Dolly Parton’s ‘Nine To Five’ and Basement Jaxx’s ‘Where’s Your Head At’ with Emerson Lake & Palmer’s ‘Theme From Peter Gun’. \r\n\r\nTongue-in-cheek is the first thing that springs to mind when reading these names, but if you peel off the first, obvious layer, you have to admit that these ‘cheesy’ mixes actually do work. Mixing 45 songs together in one hour of music is one thing. But making that hour a consistent exploration of the history of pop music is quite another. ‘2 Many DJ’s’ makes you laugh, yes indeed, but it also covers left, right, top and bottom of groovy pop. Some of the tracks on this album are obvious classics, some are simply unknown and some will very soon become hot sought-after gems. From Japanese geisha Hanayo covering ‘Joe le Taxi’, 21st century proof electro from Adult., Finnish disco from Ural 13 Diktators or sleazy Peaches to classics from The Velvet Underground, The Breeders, The Residents, Sly And The Family Stone and Nena. They’re all there for a reason. \r\n‘2 Many DJ’s’ proves that ‘genre’ has never been such a naff word.\r\n",

I’m not going to pretend that I have a manager or copywriter to write me up a very eloquent, lauding short version of my life, loaded with way too many superlatives. In stead, I’m just going to tell you what I’m doing, what I’ve been doing, and why I’m doing it, myself. First-hand, hot off the press, without decoration.\r\n\r\nLike many deejays, producers and songwriters out there, I have been captivated by music ever since I was old enough to realize it. That was probably a couple of years after 1987, the year I was born. Music is a true passion, a celebration of life, stripped from any boundaries and restrictions. It is something I have enjoyed in many forms: from hitting the pots and pans with wooden spoons to buying my first vinyl records, from going to my very first public gig to releasing my first tracks on vinyl, cd and later mp3. Up to now, it has been a journey that hasn’t ceased to amaze me.\r\n\r\nMaybe the point of this biography should be to convince you of the fact that I am in some way different than your next producer or deejay.

  "artist_bio": "Walrus hails from Brussels and is a quixotic DJ and producer that revels in idiosyncratic club music. Together with Sagat and &apos, he is a member of the house and electronic music project Bepotel.The three of them also run Bepotel Records. He is furthermore involved in organizing the bimonthly Beyond parties at the Fuse club in Brussels and plays in the synth-pop band Bright Entity. He enjoys sidestepping his club music focus by organizing wave parties called Myths and Rhythms.\r\n\r\nWalrus spends his time away from the stage putting in hours of studio work, helping out in the legendary Brussels record shop Dr. Vinyl and adhering to a relentless routine of searching for new and exciting music.\r\n\r\nHis DJ-sets are carefully crafted assaults on what club music is often perceived to be. Walrus is not afraid to unbalance and dislocate his audience, confronting people with his definition of intent, groove and musical space and building up a quirky tension that is as serious as it is open-minded. His is an appeal to the power of the imagination to hold back the night, to charm motorways and to surf on beta waves.",

Rave City became a big succes with more than 50.000 sold units. The follow up Calling Earth was again a succes with 70.000 sold singles. All this was the start of a succesfull story. A Story About House was to be the next Cherrymoon Trax single, but due to problems with the club it was changed into a new Yves Deruyter single. Unfortunately this single didn't really break anything. Nevertheless his follow up single \"The Rebel\" was immediatly signed for the world. \"The Rebel\" was a top tune and the real international breakthrough for Yves Deruyter. This single was also the announcement for this first album \"D-Album\" containing all the singles from past and future. During this period he started also the musical outlet of the Cherrymoon where he was playing. So far he made 4 Cherrymoon Trax singles of which the first \"The House of House\" and the last single \"In My Electric House\" was again succesfull in Germany.\r\n\r\nAll this in combination with the first 3D black and white video made by Frank Dewulf who became an important artist with his B-Sides releases. Yves Deruyter's vision of his future in music is and will always be the same: making music for the people. For him it is important that the people have fun while they're listening/dancing to his music. In the past he used to work with Frederico Santini, but the last couple of years his counterpart was Dirk \"M.I.K.E.\" Dierickx (Push, The Blackmaster, M.I.KE., Moon Project, ...) who is currently one of the most important producers from Bonzai Records. The single \"Rhythmic Bazz was released in June 2001. This single was taken of the album \"2001\" as well as \"Back to Earth\". The follow-up single was \"Music-Nonstop\", which also got a remix-package with remixes from e.g. Ton TB (Three Drives).\r\n\r\nHis most recent release was \"Spiritual Feeling/Y.D.O.T.\", which did pretty good all over Europe. His new single will be a re-release of \"Spiritual Feeling\", which will also include a \"Dolphin remix\". He made this remix together with L-Vee (Airwave). So get ready for Yves!\r\n\r\nInfinity & Timeless Trance After his monster cover of Underworlds classic Born Slippy, Yves Deruyter has been working like a madman the last couple of months. His new track Infinity just released and is already chosen for record of the month by the German dance magazine Raveline. Because of the all positive response, the record will also release on single January 2006, including vocals which are recorded this week. Also Yves mix cd Timeless Trance recently released in Germany and is being exported to the rest of the world at the moment! This cd contains trance classics from the last two years, all Bonzai tracks.\r\n\r\n2006 --> 2010 update in progress",

These are just some of the haunting images that characterize what the post-industrial city of La Louviere looks like. This seems a daunting context to live in, yet there is a certain atmosphere that you can't find in any other city. Let's take Vhyce as an example. This Portuguese-Italian breed steadily worked his way up to a noteworthy musical profile. Inspired by the desolation in these suburbs, or by the boredom, he grew into a self-taught producer. Musically, Vhyce is greatly influenced by the lineage of nineties RNB from the emergence of soul music onwards, which ultimately results in his signature house sounds!\r\nIn 2010 he had his nationwide breakthrough by releasing his debut EP, 'Voivodine', on the respected Australian imprint Sweat it Out. Ever since, he is continuously taking the underground music scene by storm by releasing EP’s on a regular basis. In only a few years he built an impressive discography, with releases on first-rate labels such as No Brainer records and Sweat it Out. So, Vhyce managed to outgrow his grimy neighbourhood and is heading towards a bright future, a true working class hero.",

  "artist_bio": "Always involved and in love with music, Yentl. (aka Lady Lektrix), started dj-ing by the end of 2006. \r\nTotally unexperienced, but inspired by the often surprising profundity of electronic music and the uplifting feeling that some performances \r\nat techno parties affected her with, she was curious to discover what things would be like behìnd the decks.At first, lost in the woods, she didn't know where to begin. She bought all kinds of vinyl, going from electro house to techno classics and minimal.\r\nAfter about a year, she started to prefer minimaltechno and house because this music felt most real to her, expressing moods and feelings through deep sounds and sensitive beats, yet very danceable. Her collection was influenced by a variety of styles like jackin & progressive house, tribal, latin & jazz. \r\nIn the last two years, she extended her track selection to a more specific mixture of deep and soulful minimal techno & grooving techhouse, inspired by the local scene in Belgium and nuskool sounds & labels, mainly from Berlin and Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nOver the years she had the pleasure to play at parties with headliners like ANJA SCHNEIDER, SHINEDOE, JORIS VOORN, DJ MADSKILLZ, PAN-POT, EVA MARIA, EDWIN OOSTERWAL, WARREN FELLOW, TRISH ,SEBA LECOMPTE & VIE, PETE HOWL, SPACID, DR.

  "artist_bio": "Suffering from severe eclecticism, WAP serve a stirring musical molotov cocktail. Although they find 90s stuff - and I quote - so not cool.Contrary to popular belief, Belgian dj-duo We Are Prostitutes did nót pick their moniker\r\nto honor a shared history of pleasing rich, older women for cash and a handful of\r\nvenereal diseases. Suffering from severe eclecticism, WAP serve a stirring musical molotov cocktail that wíll get you shaking: 'Dance on the rocks', consisting of 3/4 electro (to keep things going) and 1/4 pop, rock and disco (to keep your attention), all mixed together with gallons of respect for musical history. Although they find 90s stuff - and I quote - \"so not cool\".\r\n\r\nYou may know We Are Prostitutes from such venues as Decadance, Make Up Club, Culture Club, Vooruit, Het Entrepot, .. and from events like Studio Volante, Snowclash(skikot), Sam De Bruyn invites, Pop Culture, Ezekiël 25:17 and Orange&Blue.\r\nIn the past they've shared decks with - amongst others - Mish Mash, Laston & Geo, The Oddword, Otto Jan Ham, Gerrit K., Sam De Bruyn (&Samtex), Keatch, Kill your television, ...\r\n\r\nAlso, they host a monthly studentnight (Ezekiel 25:17 – Sex, violence & dirty dancing) in Decadance (Ghent). Next to this they will visit Belgian‘s national radio & tv : Stubru, FmBrussel, and GunkTV. And after all this running around you can find them on snow in april 2011 with Snowclash (skikot) in Val Thorens.\r\n\r\nFavorite tunes include crackers by Soulwax; Alex Gopher; Beastie Boys; Boyz Noize; Erol Alkan; Tiga; Crookers; Rage Against the Machine; Shameboy; Etienne de Crécy; Earth, Wind & Fire; Breakbot; Vitalic; D.I.M.; Blur; Goose; Santa Esmeralda; The Krays and many others.\r\n",

They spent their adolescence playing in various teen rock bands until they discovered the EDM scene and its crazy nightlife. Their passion for music was then taken to a whole new level ! \r\nThe boys learnt how to DJ on their own, with different pseudonyms but ended up usually playing at the same events. Quickly, they've been more & more interested about producing their own music. As roommates back then, they spent countless hours together, locked up in the studio, trying to figure out how to produce the sounds they digged.\r\n\r\nAt the eve of summer 2010, while practising their production skills on the Sander Kleinenberg's \"This is our Night\" remix contest, Dim & Raph felt particularly happy with the result and so they submitted their remix under the name \"Warrior Bros\". They did not win, but they got very positive feedback by Sander Kleinenberg himself and the remix was aired on a dutch radio, and also featured on the homepage of an eastern european music blog for weeks.\r\n\r\nThe Warrior Bros then decided to make it a serious thing and to invest themselves at 100% in their common project.\r\n\r\nOne year and quite a few parties later, their first EP was released on Basserk Records!\r\n\r\nBasserk Records it's a fresh young label based in Amsterdam, who has grown very fast the past 5 years with lots of releases and remixes by Nobody Beats The Drum, Modek, Gtronic, DoctR, The Subs and many many more.\r\n\r\nAfter some tracks & remixes released again on Basserk Records , they've made a long studio time to find the real WBRS sound!\r\n\r\n2 years after their birth, WBRS are now ready to bring you their power ! The Analog power !\r\n\r\nWatch out , they're in the place and they won't be quiet !\r\n\r\nThe WarriorBros shared stages with : Hatiras ,Mightyfools, Borgore, Cyberpunkers, Gtronic, Tom Deluxx , Highbloo, Botox Bad Beats, Bronstibock, Dj Halo, Process Rebel, Dave Luxe,  ...\r\n\r\nBOOKINGS / REMIX REQUESTS / INFO : warriorbrs@gmail.com\r\n",
