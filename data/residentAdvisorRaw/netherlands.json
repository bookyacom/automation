  "artist_bio": "In the span of less than 2 years, Afrojack has become one of electronic dance music's major icons. From humble DJ beginnings in his native country of Holland, he has grown to become a multi-award winning, platinum-selling producer.His skills are some of the most sought after in the world, and with two Grammy Awards under his belt, it's easy to see why. In addition to this, his DJ sets have fast become both iconic and unparalleled, providing an explosive take on the current state of dance music across the board.\r\n\r\nStarting off in his hometown of Spijkenisse, Nick van der Wall, aka Afrojack, quickly made a name for himself with a slew of hard-hitting underground releases, before exploding in 2011 with the unveiling of \"Take Over Control\" - an instant worldwide club and chart hit going platinum in the USA. This also helped solidify his own imprint Wall Recordings as a pioneering club music brand - a value he holds dear as label boss and insures with every release.\r\n\r\nFrom there the snowball continued; as well as making club hits and collaborating with the likes of David Guetta (co-writing and producing the world-wide smash \"Titanium\"), he also began to team up with and write for pop artists around the world. In 2011 he co-wrote and produced \"Give Me Everything\" for Pitbull and Ne-Yo, which to this day has sold over 5 million copies worldwide. Not to mention his work for Beyonce's \"Run the World (Girls)\" & his Grammy nominated remix for Leona Lewis' \"Collide\".\r\n\r\nThe buying public are not the only ones to have noticed his remarkable prowess and has so far been awarded with Grammy Awards for Best Remix (Madonna, \"Revolver\") in 2011) and Best Rap/Hip Hop Track for his co-production duties on Chris Brown's \"Look At Me Now\" this year. 2012 continued upwards when his latest single with Shermanology \"Can't Stop Me\" went top 10 in Holland and is now all over Top 40 radio in the US, while his newest underground club hit \"Rock The House\" topped the Beatport charts after just 3 days, making it one of the fastest number one records there ever.\r\n\r\nAfrojack's skills stretch much farther than the mixing desk however; his presence as one of the world's top performers is solidified almost daily in a gruelling tour schedule. In 2012 alone he began his North American \"Jacked\" tour with multiple sold out shows featuring his growing posse of Wall artists, before embarking on the same concept throughout Europe with 7 shows a week throughout the summer. On top of his own shows, he headlined both EDC NY & Las Vegas to over 300.000 people, as well as the UMF in Miami + Tomorrowland and many other major festivals throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nHis long anticipated yet to be named artist album is nearing completion, with tracks already being road-tested at clubs. A true testament to his prolific profile as a producer and an artist, the long-player will showcase multiple sides of the Afrojack sound - from aggressive to accessible yet always credible. In the pantheon of EDM greats that have risen over the years, Afrojack has earned his place already, but is far from finished with what he has to share. The adventure continues while the beat goes on.",

  "artist_bio": "Albert van Abbe started making music and performing live in 2001, he’s one of the very few Dutch techno live acts, having performed Berghain, Awakenings & ADE just to name a few. He is currently operating two record labels, No Comment and VANABBE, but has also released his music on prominent labels as Semantica, Deep Sound Channel, Trolldans, ESHU & Curle. Van Abbe's music can be described as a kind of Catharsis; cleansing the listener through a deep yet open soundscape filled with strengthening melancholia and salubrious air. He is currently also hosting his own events for deeper dance music DRUM in his hometown Eindhoven.\r\n\r\nBookings: toon@k​azz.be | NL: daniel@gloam.nlIt doesn't happen often, but sometimes you catch the eyes of a man as you pass him by in the street and you instantly get a feeling that this is not someone to mess with. It has nothing to do with aggression or malice – in fact, it's never the loud, cocky guys with the attitude and the practiced “cool” walk and talk. No, it's the calm, steady gaze of someone who has seen and experienced things and learned from them. Indeed, it does not happen often, but it's even more unusual to get that same feeling conveyed to you through art, literature or music. Albert van Abbe is that unusual.\r\n\r\nAlbert van Abbe started making music and performing live in 2001 but when listening to his work, there are certain elements that rather makes you think of 1901. Melancholic whispers of Stravinsky, Ravel or Schönberg, reduced and concentrated to rhythmical and melodic patterns, sometimes breaking free of the constraints set by arpeggiators or sequencers. Perhaps this otherly, nonconformist way of thinking and doing music is most evident in van Abbe's live performances, and he is in fact one of the very few Dutch techno live acts having performed Berghain, Awakenings & ADE just to name a few.\r\n\r\nBut there's something else that sets him apart from the vast majority of his contemporary techno colleagues, something that's harder to pin down. There's so much electronic music these days that is either intentionally underproduced; grimy, harsh and simplistic, or overproduced; tumescent, hyper-compressed and dense. Albert van Abbe's music is distinctively neither. There is always air in his productions; infinite skies, passing clouds, thin vapour rising from open fields... visions of mountain tops or endless tree crowns half covered in mist. There is always place for you within his music to fill your lungs to the brim with this cleansing air. A feeling of unrestrained, reflecting Albert van Abbe's own recalcitrant and anti-authoritative personality. To put it simple: It's music with a view. \r\n\r\nBesides performing, producing music and DJing,  Albert van Abbe also currently operates two record labels, No Comment and VANABBE. He has also released music on Semantica, Deep Sound Channel, Trolldans, ESHU & Curle.\r\n\r\nBookings: toon@k​azz.be | NL: booking@albertvanabbe.nl",

Although he directs his productions at the global techno-genre, he explores the boundaries of this style with attention for conceptual and melodic elements.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of his work can be described as saturated and harmonious, as well as melancholic, rude and synthetic. In his live act, Actitect brings his dynamic set with a musician-like approach: live synthesizers and live percussion combined with mixing, drumcomputers and effects.\r\n\r\nInspired at young age by the music of the Commodore 64 computer and early house- and synthesizer music of the eighties, he learned the first tricks of production by watching his older brother creating and releasing tracks in the first years of the 90’s. Joris played the piano since he could reach the keys, explored the possibilities of computers and programming and began to produce music at the age of twelve. Once old enough to visit raves, he began his journey through the variance of electronic styles the booming Dutch dance scene had to offer; from oldschool and hardcore to trance and hardstyle, to eventually completely fall in love with techno. Since then he has been influenced by deejays and producers like Joey Beltram, Richie Hawtin, Umek, Secret Cinema, Cari Lekebusch, Alexander Kowalski, The Advent, Marco Carola, Alex Under, Gui Boratto and Underworld, but also by jazz and pop musicians like Miles Davis, Micheal Jackson and Herbie Hancock.\r\n\r\nAfter working on a successful career as a designer for a considerable period (e.g. Alessi, Philips), Joris decided to put his design work a bit more on the side to find more time to focus on music, his true passion. Currently, Actitect is working on his new action-packed live-act and new tracks released on labels across the globe.\r\n\r\nJoris is the initiator of the multi-artist live experience Symbiotic Sessions in Utrecht, playes live at events of Dommelvallei Eindhoven, Kings Day, Halfpercenters, Today’s Art Festival in The Hague and had a live radio appearance on XT3 Techno Radio. He also was selected for the first Red Bull Music Academy Taster in Amsterdam.",

Furthermore, he has his own monthly show on Red Light Radio and he produces edits, some released on vinyl by Salamanca Records.\r\n\r\nIn his eternal search for danceable music he became, with a detour through wave, house, techno and disco, a true connaisseur of exotic music. As his name might have given away, it is mostly music from Africa in which he found his love. However, this doesn’t mean he exclusively deals with African music, it’s maybe where it began. His quest for music brings him to every musical corner of the globe. ‘Everywhere there is something you could find. Music seems like a bottomless pit’ according to Afrobot. \r\n\r\nWillfull is a word one could use to describe Afrobot in his music. Always searching for the unknown, but still looking for a familiar feel. ‘I am always looking for obscure records when I’m digging. I don’t want to play what others are playing. That bores me. But I do want to play tracks that feel like you heard them before, but you don’t necessarily know them already. And there always has to be some kind of electronic element. A synth line or a rickety drum machine in the background for example.’\r\n\r\nHis music also can’t be called world music by definition, but it’s the mix-up with European and American influences he likes. “The more confusing the better: a krautrock song with traditional ethnic instruments that sounds like an African record; that Nigerian boogie or Turkish disco track that are comparable to an American production and that Bollywood break that is a Kraftwerk copy. In music people have always liked to travel…”",

Due to this fast growth he was able to leave quite an impression in the Rotterdam scene.\r\n\r\nMusic has always been a part of his life. In music he feels he’s in his element – understood. A versatile DJ who takes his energy from the audience and feels what the moment calls for.\r\n\r\nHe finds himself in deep house, tech house and techno.  \r\nAlien NTT preferably plays dark, bassy music with balls. This often surfaces when the audience feels his music so he can lift them up to his level.\r\n\r\nSince his start as a DJ he also got into internet radios shows and did this for a year or so with the people of Beatsessions.\r\nHe also played along some fine DJs, such as Sam Paganini, Bart Skils, and Hot Since 82.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2014 Alien NTT co-headlined Underground Mindelo on the Cape Verde islands. Here he was able to transfer his love of music to an untapped audience with his own unique style.\r\n\r\nExpectations are high for Alien NTT. After all, it’s his track record and attitude that make him a very promising artist.\r\n\r\n‘I just like people who love music. That’s who I want to play for.’",

  "artist_bio": "DJ/producer Alex Motu brings you deep house beats from Amsterdam. Loves to play soulful house with deep and techhouse flavours. Also organiser of MINX Exclusive - Amsterdam [Holland] and resident DJ at Dogglounge deephouse radio.ALEX MOTU has been active in the dutch-house scene since 1989. He started as a light-jockey in de “Waakzaamheid” in Zaandam, where he was working together with Eelco Anceaux (Chemistry). Shortley after, he was asked by Jeffrey “Abraxas” Porter, for sound and light support at Planet E. A weekly clubnight in the Koggestraat in Amsterdam. When Planet E had to close, Jeroen Flamman and his partner Jeff Porter, opened up the first and famous “Subtopia” after-boat behind the Central Station (scaffolding 14), where Alex, again, was responsible for the sound and lights as well as being a dj. This is where he played together with artists like Gino Lightner, Abraxas, Flamman, Jeroen Homan, Armando (USA), LFO (UK), Eddie “Flashin” Fowlkes (Detroit), Juan Atkins (Detroit) …and others.\r\n\r\nAround the same time he sqatted a premises at the Joden Breestraat, corner Waterlooplein, together with Harrie Wildeman (“Supperclub”), and started up another weekly afterparty called “Morning Glory”, where he played with artists like Per, Gino Leitner, Crazy Shaun….and others.\r\n\r\nShortly after that, at the sqatted Buitenwieringenstraat (the 3 floor premises where part of the “Subtopia” crew was living) there were massive home/house parties with even live-acts by Fierce Ruling Diva, XLR8, Juan Atkins and ofcourse dj’s. Also, at the old sqatted porn movie theatre (“Parisien”) across the road, the crew created parties with the most crazy and amazing decorations. These were the best underground parties of the beginning of the house scene in Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nEventually in 1992, Alex and the “Subtopia” crew ended up in the north of Amsterdam where they rented a big loft (capacity 1000+) , and started a new weekly night called “Transit”. For about 6 months the whole crew played her together with dj’s like Per, Dano and Keoki (NYC).\r\n\r\nSince then Alex organised several underground parties together with DJ Miss Wendy in and around Amsterdam, on locations like “Mazzo”, “Repetitiehuis”, “Okshoofd”, “Akhnaton”, “Catacombe” etc.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time he was also responsible for the promotion, together with Diana, and the decorations, together with Jarmo & Aphrodite (Ibiza, NL) of the hot and busy sunday night “Hour Power” parties by Vandy O’ Mall (Powerzone) at “Escape Venue” (Amsterdam) and the “After Hour Power” at the “Lexion Venue” (Westzaan).\r\n\r\nAnd so he was also responsible for the lighting at the one and only number one afterclub of Amsterdam; the “Dino’s”.\r\n\r\nSo these days he is producing his own music as well as organising his own TEC909, NOSHIT!, Club Cream and MINX parties [Netherlands], together with DJ Miss Wendy.\r\n\r\nAnd on thursdaynights to fridaymornings from 01.00 - 03.00hrs. Dutch time, he presents the Amsterdam Dance Radio & TV show, together with DJ Miss Wendy and Bob Squat. This show is also broadcasted live on Salto 1 TV in Amsterdam and the North of Holland.\r\n\r\nEvery mondaynight DEEP AMSTERDAM [LIVE] at Dogglounge.com deephouse radio. A journey into the deep with Alex Motu from Amsterdam. From 10-12am GMT // 4-6am Chicago time.",

His adventures in music started in the early nineties, as a very young child fiddling around in his dad's recording studio and buying his own records with his allowance. His passion for music and his élan reflects in his whole being.Alex's career choice is not completely random, as music runs in the family. His label project Tomorrow Is Now, Kid! is also a continuation of his father's work – TINK! Records, which founded when he was but 2 years old. After years working on intense promotion and back office activity, sparkled with many hours spent in the studio making music and practicing DJ skills, both Alex and his label Tomorrow Is Now, Kid! have grown to become reference brands in modern House music. The label is the home of some of the most exciting artists in the field and Alex has grown to become it's main figure, as one of the brand's most cherished DJ's and it's main activist.\r\n\r\nHis impeccable mixing skills, deep digging habits and unpredictable, creative swing make him a much sought presence in DJ booths all over Europe, from Manchester to Paris, Lisbon to Berlin and Belgium. His uncanny ability of establishing a strict connection with the ebb and flow of a party is only second to his religious vinyl buying habits and uncompromising stance when it comes to selecting: a lover of swinging snares, soulful chords and sparse vocal hints, of all things made on an MPC to most things homemade in the 90's and unafraid to cross sect those with a healthy dose of Disco history and Jazz Funk legends. Alex has a unique way of going about his thing and maybe that's why he's so well known for driving a dance floor wild.",

Or as we say it: 'Cutting Edge House Music'. The monthly Nights at Doozo (Leeuwarden) are not only popular for the music but even more for the ambience Arthouse creates and were he became Resident Dj. \r\n\r\nTo bring his productions skills to the next level, Andreas locked himself up in the studio for some time. This resulted in a more techy, yet deep sound. In 2007 he joined the label Klopfgeist. He released a number of tracks like: 'I Want To Buy A Dog (including a Lauhaus Remix), 'Slippery When Wet'  or 'The Big Hangover' which gained lots of support with Artist like Richie Hawtin, Magda, Troy Pierce and many others.\r\n\r\nAndreas Launched Moral Fiber, a record label on the love for electronic music, early 2012. What previously went under the name Progressive House, now evolved to Tech House and Deep Techno without losing its forwards thinking spirit. Moral Fiber and her artist will continue to create something meaningful for electronic music enthusiasts. It's no wonder Moral Fiber means doing what is right, no matter what the circumstance..\r\n\r\nNowadays Andreas is Resident Dj of one of the best underground clubs in Holland called 'Paradigm' (www.paradigm050.com), and start his own Night called 'Framed'.",

Hailing from Amsterdam, Alex has stolen the hearts of many music lovers. His live shows are always full of energy and interaction, making each set a memory imprinted on listeners. Whether he plays in clubs like Sugar Factory (Amsterdam), Technique Boutique (South Africa) or at festivals like Love Parade (Berlin), his rhythmic and melodic sets are always \"body moving and mind grooving.\"\r\n\r\nAlex de Saint in South Africa live tour!\r\n\r\nMy experience in South Africa has been very adventurous. In a short time I have been robbed twice and lost all my studio stuff, “welcome to South Africa.” In stark contrast to this I have met many people in the SA music scene who have helped me. Johannesburg is a very friendly place with many varied individuals. A special thanks goes to Roman Sergey, considered one of the best organizers in South Africa, who helped me find my feet again. The parties here are quite different from what we know in Europe, much smaller and not as dressed up. The sound is also more old-school.\r\n\r\nI'm currently one of the head-line residents at a new club in South Africa. It's at one of the best spots in Sandton, Pepa Cafe and is called Technique Boutique. I'm working there with South African legend Chris Palmer, every Saturday. Chris has been involved in SA's music industry for 17 years. He's a mastering engineer by day and DJ by night. We really want to make Techno music huge in South Africa. Those who come check me out for one of my live sets are guaranteed lots of pounding bass and groovy tunes.\r\n\r\nAbout Alex de Saint:\r\n\r\nI graduated with a Masters Degree in Academics (MA) in audio Visual Technology in Hilversum. I studied 3D animation and Protools as well as all of the diverse applications you can find in the visual word like Adobe and Macromedia. I ran my own company before this supplying audio visual technology to customers. Some of these customers required me to create audio visual technologies for their web pages, amongst other things. One of my biggest projects was working for Albert Boekholt at Wisseloord Sound Studios. He was involved with huge artists like Mick Jagger, Tina Turner and many more.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory of Artists I worked with or have played with:\r\n\r\nAlbert Boekholt, Kenn Isshi, Orlando Voorn, Chris Palmer (SA), Red Wood (4 time S.A Scratch Champ, Beatboxer, 13th at the World DMC DJ Battle.), Funk D’Void, Phonic Func (Sony Music), Rutger Maree , Dj Sian, Gino (NYC), Dave Tarrida (Tresor), Dj Velasca (Colombia), Joran van de Pol, Dexon, Brian-S, Deksels, Stereo Sphere (Germany), Dj Lady Ace, The Salvador Brothers and DJ Gordon.\r\n\r\nFor more info, checkout:\r\nhttp://www.residentadvisor.net/ or http://www.musicpress.nl/ or http://www.djguide.nl/\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlex De Saint & DJ Gavo\r\nAlex De Saint & SebOtage\r\nAlex De Saint & Matt Laubscher\r\nAlex de Saint & Waide Lemos\r\nAlex de Saint & Nick Grater\r\nAlex de Saint & Brothers Underground\r\nAlex de Saint & Dj  Nokken UK\r\nAlex de Saint & Chris Palmer Technique Boutique\r\nAlex de Saint & Red Wood (4 time S.A Scratch Champ, Beatboxer, 13th at the World DMC DJ Battle.)\r\nAlex de Saint on Tswaing Crater Gathering 03-2-2012\r\nAlex de Saint on the radio http://www.dancewebradio.co.za/\r\nAlex de Saint & Funk D’Void, Dj Rolando – Knight of the Jaguar himself 29-4-2011\r\nAlex de Saint & Kenn Isshi 05-03-2011\r\nAlex de Saint & Funk D’Void 29-01-2011\r\nAlex de Saint & Orlando Voorn 18-12-2010\r\nAlex de Saint & Dave Tarrida (tresor)\r\nAlex de Saint & Psycatron live show\r\nAlex de Saint & Phonic Func (Sony Music)\r\nAlex de Saint & Dj Sian\r\nAlex de Saint & Gino (USA)\r\nAlex de Saint & Dj Velasca (Colombia)\r\nAlex de Saint & Joran van de Pol\r\nAlex de Saint & Dexon\r\nAlex de Saint & Brian-S\r\nAlex de Saint & Jerome Krom\r\nAlex de Saint & Deksels\r\nAlex de Saint & Fillas outland rec\r\nAlex de Saint & Dj Celeste\r\nAlex de Saint & Stereo Sphere (Germany)\r\nAlex de Saint & Dj Mischa Duncan\r\nAlex de Saint & Dj Thomas Robson\r\nAlex de Saint & Dj Lady Ace\r\nAlex de Saint & The Salvador Brothers\r\n\r\nAnd so much more :)",

Since his first release in 2009, Alex has been locked up in the studio and only left his domain to smash up crowds with his unique groove. While growing up as an energetic young rebel, he started to play the guitar and drums at the age of eight and as he got older, he taught himself to play the piano and followed his passion as he continued to learn everything there is about DJing, music technology and sound development.\r\n\r\nIn 2013 his single: \"Rude Boys\" in colaboration with Dennis Ramoon hit the #1 spot for 3 weeks in a row in the techhouse charts on Traxsource in 3 days after it's been released. \"Feel The Music\", which was released on his own label \"Shut Up & Groove\", also received amazing support and new music is there to come, spending all of his time in the studio these days.\r\n\r\nWhile his music find its way to the clubs worldwide, his dj sets are also turning venues upside down. Since he played his very first gig at the biggest hotspot in Amsterdam, the Heineken Music Hall, Alex has been playing nonstop. \r\n\r\n“The real Alex Sandrino sound is tech/tribal, but also contains elements from other genres, so don’t expect me to just sit in a little corner with my eyes closed and not listen to any other kind of music”, Alex’s answer when asked what his music sounds like in his point of view...",

Jan Boom and Branko van Hilten have played almost all quality dance events in the Netherlands, with a unique ability to warm up the night. Slots at festivals such as Isla Electronica, We Love Stagefestival and Lief Festival and residencies at Amsterdam’s Panama club and Club NL have ensured this Dutch duo have played alongside the likes of John Digweed, Deep Dish, Nick Warren, Danny Howells, Jimmy van M, Pete Tong, Dave Seaman, Groove Armada, Faithless, Nic Fanciulli, Sister Bliss, Guy J, Timo Maas and Mark Knight over the years. With tracks released on Pure Substance Records and LuPS Records the guys solidified their name in the scene.\r\n\r\nHaving used the Schaamteloos-DJs moniker for many years, it is now time for something new. Analog Effect is the transition from early evening to main set, a new approach to studio and a general overhaul of their sound. Whilst looking to the future, the name Analog Effect is a nod to more traditional methods of (analog) studio production, such as remixing tracks by cutting and pasting actual tape on a Revox tape recorder. This duo’s production roots stem from creating beats and bleeps on an Atari as teenagers, and this is it manifested in a professional capacity.\r\n\r\nToday, with their heads firmly down in their new custom-built studio, this hard-working duo are further cementing their name as reliable and solid performers, ready to step up to the next level. With a slew of hot new material, the future looks bright, upcoming releases slated such as ‘Determined’ [Why Not Recordings] and a hot remix of Dutch progressive talent Eelke Kleijn’s ‘On The Edge’. This track is due for release on Ferry Corsten’s Flashover Recordings.\r\n\r\nAnalog Effect is the future –a firm production schedule, a higher profile and the focus on headline slots in clubs, festivals and beach parties, keep an eye on this forward-thinking duo in 2011.",

  "artist_bio": "For bookings contact: yogh@oakbookings.com\r\nFor inquiries/promo's contact: anil@slapfunk.comAnil has always been a true music-addict. At the age of four he started his musical journey by playing the violin. His curiosity to discover new sounds then led him to playing the piano as well as learning the basics of drums from a good friend.\r\n\r\nListening to a broad variety of music Anil discovered his special love for electronic music. Back in the old days he was already listening to hardcore, which was a rage in the Netherlands at that time. Some years later he fell in love again with electronic music, but this time it was much more intense. In particular the new techno sounds in the year 2000 gave him inspiration to combine his own unique style with this kind of music. This passion has led to a continuous collection of records and a desire to never stop with this true love.\r\n\r\nHe currently stills loves the sound of techno from 2000. However, in the last couple of years he has also started to collect house records. Anil feels these are like the older techno: “the tracks may be different, but for me it has the same old, deep and raw feelings. That's why I really like both styles. And in my opinion one thing is for sure; old love never dies...''.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.soundcloud.com/anil-aras\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/anilarasgrooves\r\nhttp://www.discogs.com/artist/Anil+Aras\r\nhttp://www.beatport.com/artist/anil-aras/191102",

The overwhelming rhythms stayed in his music till this very day.\r\n\r\nOn arrival to the Netherlands with the aid of Rotterdam influences, the breaks went to the background and the sound of house and techno started to dominate. However, the irresistible bass lines and haunting rhythms in live performances do reflect previous experiences.\r\n\r\nSoon after, with the help of right entourage various live performances in Rotterdam and Amsterdam started to accumulate. In 2009 Majestic 012 was the finalist of the “Rotterdam Dj contest” set in a famous Bootleg Dj Café together with the legendary Clones Rotterdam label, which gave a boost of radio shows and frequent appearances there.\r\n\r\n\r\nInternational touch of the sound that varies from deep and melodic groove of house/techno to bass driven modern techno with the minimal touch (of course), can be heard in the MJ012 performances in various places - Russia, Spain and, of course, the Netherlands, and Greece which were visited in the recent time.",

His dj sets are cheered by techno lovers as extremely forward thinking and musically well constructed. His releases and remixes for Drumcode, 100% Pure, Cocoon and Rejected are internationally rated as some of the most cutting edge dance tracks to come out of Holland in recent years.His reputation for tight productions gave him opportunities to work and remix artists and friends like Joris Voorn, Adam Beyer, Christian Smith, Nicole Moudaber, Kaiserdisco and Kollektiv Turmstrasse. As one of the main players on Amsterdam’s renowned scene, their percussive take on techno and house music are well loved by many.\r\n\r\nSkils’ long running Voltt nights at Paradiso have proven pivotal in bringing Amsterdam’s New School generation together. During the late nineties Skils’ undivided dedication to techno already landed him a residential spot at the infamous Mazzo venue. This was where he promoted his first techno fuelled nights, consistently staging the most futuristic in four to the floor beats. Many techno pioneers made their first Dutch appearances at these legendary nights and Voltt is still widely regarded as one of the leading events in Amsterdam’s internationally acclaimed club scene. His massive outdoor festival “Voltt Loves Summer” is praised by many in the Dutch scene as an absolute highlight of the year; over 15.000 party people attend this yearly happening on an old shipyard in Amsterdam! \r\n\r\nWith his residency at his own events, gigs all over Europe and many releases and remixes to be played out on the dancefloor, Skils’ dj star has been rising steadily and is shining bright. Persistently rocking venues and festival sites, he has further underlined his position as one of the country’s most reliable and authorative dj’s.

This merging of worlds manifests in a versatile nature that is audible in the narrative selection of tracks and dj-sets.\r\n\r\nJoining their perspectives in a meticulous, hands-on working method, the two bring a balanced and hypnotizing sound to the club. Be it in the form of a dj set or their full- fledged hardware live set crystallizing in the mind and oscillating the body.

  "artist_bio": "It was Anton Pieete's grandfather who stirred his grandson initial urge to make electronic music, by passing on his old synthesizer in 1997. And not without success. Now a days Anton Pieete is a key member of Amsterdam's New School generation and is storming dance floors with his captivating take on contemporary techno. Innovative and in your face, his hybrid sound is steeped in industrial techno twisted with tough, edgy high-octane tech house.\r\n\r\nAnton's first big break came in 2008, when 'Players' on Intacto Records hit the #1 top spot on Beatport. Later in 2009 he shot up the charts again with 'Siberian' on Intacto Records, driving the international clubbing masses to the dancefloor. Also his collaboration with Bart Skils, as District One, brought the same insane effect on the partycrowd. \r\n\r\nApplying the philosophy of 'less is more', then tweaking it with a heavier, ballsy sound, Anton has clearly carved a fresh, new direction for techno. His straight forward style seems to be exactly what people are longing for after years of clicking and clocking.\r\n\r\nWhether he is DJing or igniting the crowd with his liveset, performing solo or as District One, he always cooks the floors, gaining him a global reputation for being Amsterdam's contemporary techno master.",

  "artist_bio": "Bart still refuses to limit himself to just one style of dance music and other labels are beginning to discover and recognize his diversity. Black Hole Recordings signed his trance monster entitled \"Ringworld\" under his latest Fictivision moniker and gave it a proper worldwide release in the early months of 2003.What does one need these days in order to succeed in today's tough world of the music industry? A great deal of determination would be a big answer. Besides the obvious elements such as knowing the right people, managing a fresh outlook towards Dance music and possessing a certain level of musical awareness, maybe the most important quality that Dutch producer Bart van Wissen brings to the table is his genuine raw talent. By the look of how things have gone for him last year in 2003, Bart has plenty to offer us.\r\n\r\nHis dreams began around the tender age of seven, when his grandfather gave him his first keyboard. It didn't take long before he taught himself to play some basic songs with it. After some time, his parents decided that it wouldn't be such a bad idea if he took some lessons to help develop his musical skills. At age eleven, when most people are listening to bland pop songs on commercial radio, Bart started producing Jungle tracks with the use of tracker software on his computer. His tastes continued to evolve and he absorbed a larger variety of different styles such as Acid-House, Trip-Hop and a healthy dose of Abstract Beats. All of which remain a major influence in his present work.\r\n\r\nIn early 2000, a good friend gave Bart a Trance compilation and he fell in love with its massive sounds and pulsating beats. He started using Propellerheads Reason virtual studio software to make new beats and his destiny took a full turn for the better after he submitted his first demo to Deep label-boss Peter van Hal. Van Hal listened to just a few songs then quickly decided that Bart was extremely unique. His fresh sound and incredible musical versatility really shined through his work.\r\n\r\nBart still refuses to limit himself to just one style of dance music and other labels are beginning to discover and recognize his diversity. Black Hole Recordings signed his trance monster entitled \"Ringworld\" under his latest Fictivision moniker and gave it a proper worldwide release in the early months of 2003. He followed up with the double-A side \"Illuminate\" and \"Deviate\" on Deep under his own name. This record reflected his passion for cool, crisp grooves and smooth, melodic House music. Around the same time, he also released the critically acclaimed \"Space Tourist\" and \"Distant Region\" cuts on Extrema Records. The release was charted by the highest order and \"Region\" even made an appearance in Mo Shic's February Essential Mix.\r\n\r\nBart's future remains extremely bright, refining his sound with each new release. After scoring more critical success this year with his recent \"Unforeseen\" (Private Reality) and \"One Reason\" (his monster on Low Riders that appeared in Sasha & Digweed's May Essential Mix), he is maintaining his momentum with two amazing remixes of Blue Haze's \"See Me Fall\" (Deep) to help the label celebrate its 20th release.\r\n\r\nWe nearly forgot another important aspect of Bart van Wissen. He has also been working behind the decks for several years now. He's quickly becoming an excellent DJ, capable of working huge crowds with his fresh attitude and tight mixing skills.\r\n\r\nHis combination of House and Progressive tunes is slowly building him a name while positioning him as one of the top new talents in his native home of Holland. Not a bad run so far, with only 21 years of age almost behind him. So now, take a moment out of your time and meet one of the leaders of the next generation of Dance music's prime entertainers!",

Heavily influenced by a city that breaths industrial strength twenty-fourseven, he gradually found his way into creating an unique dark\r\nsound, which lead him to the forefront of the European techno scene.\r\n\r\nIn 2002 he kickstarted the already legendary Audio Assault record label with label partner Jeroen Liebregts aka Radial, which resulted in the birth of sublabel Arms one year later. Since then the Audio Assault family built a strong and constantly growing fan-base worldwide, showcasing an impressive catalogue with a constant output of stand out twelve inches, setting the standard for today’s quality dark techno.\r\n\r\nFor many years he has been a member of the Rotterdam underground collective ‘Strictly Techno’, creators of over a hundred legendary parties since 1996. Bas has played at many ‘top of the\r\nbill’ clubs and festivals around the globe and is a regular guest at\r\nthe highly respected Awakenings parties in Holland.\r\n\r\nOver the years Bas has been a hard working and devoted producer, spending many hours in the studio and putting out music on respected labels such as Mote Evolver, Perc Trax, CLR, Sleaze Records, Planet Rhythm and of course his own imprints Audio Assault and Mord.

  "artist_bio": "1 2 3 let's rollAwanto 3, the alter ego of Steven de Peven, set foot on this earth just a few years ago, although his musical career has been ongoing for 20 years already. Growing up with two uncles on his mother’s side who had a disco drive-in show, and a father who played oboe in an orchestra, there was no escape from music whatsoever. \r\n\r\nThose two foundations have contributed to his broad interest in music, from jazz, hip hop, soul and latin, to house, techno, juke and booty. He already had his first residency at the age of seventeen in a notorious club called Piranha in the northern Dutch city of Den Helder, where he spoiled the scum of the earth with his house records. Shortly after moving to Amsterdam at 22, he hosted his own jazz-oriented club night in the infamous Vaaghuyzen, which eventually got him into the legendary club Mazzo. \r\n\r\nDuring this period of time he met Kid Sublime and both hopped onboard a musical rollercoaster, starting to produce music together; Steven on his MPC2000, which is still his most loyal tool for productions. They found themselves as true hit wonders and named their music Filterjazz, or big band on prozac. Dressed up like vagabonds they left a musical trace of absurd hilarity throughout Amsterdam, which resulted in the Nana EP and ended with their debut album Iller Dan Je Ouders. The album got great reviews internationally; Theo Parrish and Moodyman used to get high on it and even animals like cats and dogs stayed quiet for minutes listening to it. Also at that same time Steven started his own record label, Zephon’s Mom, on which he released Mocky amongst others. The electro label Klakson, in collaboration with Steffi and Dexter, was also born during that Mazzo era. \r\n\r\nAfter his break-up with Kid Sublime, Steven found another musical soulmate: Aardvarck got him back on his feet to continue the Rednose rollercoaster ride. They released the album Euh with Benny Sings and Poes (featuring Benny Sings, Mocky and Deborah Jordan). Meanwhile he handed Klakson over to Steffi, quit with Zephon’s Mom, and started to work more and more with people like San Proper, Dexter, Jan Overlast, Maximillion, and Tom Trago.\r\n\r\nMusic-wise you can expect all ranges of dance music from Awanto 3: everything from 100 bpm to 170 bpm. House, disco, techno, booty and juke, there is only one condition: there has to be soul in it, even if it’s ugly, fast and loud. Keeping the women on the dance floor is not only for his own interest, but also to keep the atmosphere balanced. Speaking of which, Awanto 3 is kinda sensitive regarding decoration and lighting. In his view, every aspect in music and ambient conditions are just as important to set the right tone. He plays his records from his gut feeling, an intuitive reaction to what is going on on the dance floor.\r\n\r\nWith releases on Soulrock, Dekmantel, Rush Hour and Voyage Direct, Clone Royal Oak, Concrete to name a few, Awanto 3 grew up fast.  His debut album is due to come out in 2013. What to expect? The absolutely unexpected.",

  "artist_bio": "The flag-bearer of the trance movement, one of the biggest scenes in EDM worldwide. A down-to-earth guy, living the extraordinary life of one of the world’s most popular DJ’s.No matter how many hours Armin van Buuren has travelled to get there, as soon as he enters the DJ booth, the Dutchman  has his full focus on the music, the crowd and how these two will combine. As soon as the beats of his first record have kicked in, the room lights up and chanting fills the air. To witness a set of Armin van Buuren is to be blown away, to completely lose yourself into the music and be one with the people around you. Mixed seamlessly, he created his own style and sound, making his DJ sets a unique experience. He unites millions, not only through the gigs in his challenging schedule, but also through his Armin Only and A State of Trance world tours.\r\n\r\nArmin has the privilege to perform at some of the world’s biggest and best festivals, clubs, events and shows. One of the highlights in his career was Armin’s performance for the new crowned King and Queen of The Netherlands, Willem-Alexander and Máxima. Together with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, in front of the monarchs and 15.000 fans, he performed both ‘The Bolero’ as well as an orchestral version of the title track of his ‘Intense’ album. During the ‘koningsvaart’, a special, cultural boat-trip in the city of Amsterdam, the King and Queen surprised both the crowd as well as Armin by getting on stage and dancing along.\r\n\r\nAnother highlight was Armin’s DJ set at the Museumplein in Amsterdam in July 2010, during the honoring of the Dutch soccer team. Even though the national team  lost in the FIFA World Cup final, they partied like they were the absolute winners, and so did the 200.000 strong crowd. That’s exactly what Armin’s sets are all about.\r\n\r\nAfter the 2013 summer season has ended, with his own residency at the world’s biggest club, Privilege in Ibiza, Armin kicks off a new Armin Only world tour, based on his ‘Intense’ album, in collaboration with theatre director Jos Thie. The Dutch edition of the show, with two nights at the Amsterdam Ziggo Dome, sold out within only a few hours. In the meantime, more than 20 dates have been added, with shows landing in cities such as Kiev, Mumbai, Saint-Petersburg, Helsinki, New York, Toronto, Mexico City, Sydney, Johannesburg and more. With the brand new Armin Only tour, Armin brings a unique and exclusive show, unfolding the many layers of his ‘Intense’ album.\r\n\r\nHis busy life as a DJ has inspired many people. In 2009, Dutch author Coen Bom presented his on-the-road-biography of Armin, called ‘Eén op één’ / ‘Armin Only’, reporting about the hectic life of Armin and trying to find the secret behind to the grand success of the humble Dutchman. In October 2012, the official documentary ‘A Year With Armin van Buuren’ was released,  in which Armin was followed during an important year in his life, offering a unique look behind the scenes and inside his personality.",

  "artist_bio": "Audio Unknown is a new dutch EDM trio with an explosive style and image. A dj, a mc and a female vocalist.\r\n\r\nDj (John) and MC (Danny) met when touring for their longstanding and successful hardcore project in Russia 2012.\r\n\r\nBoth of them wanted to do something else and they decided to team up with female singer/ songwriter Fyona Curvers. Together with her divine lyrics and vocals, John’s experienced producer skills and Danny’s creative mind they realized a strong coming DJ act that has gained notoriety as Audio Unknown.Danny (the mc) and John (the dj) have been in the music scene since the 90's, both representing the harder dance scene. Danny was the mc in the happy hardcore group Critical Mass (hit singles Burning Love, Believe In The Future and Happy Generation) and did this for 3 full years, toured in several countries, radio and televisionshows. John was a dj and producer for the hardcore label Enzyme at first, but later on switched to power hardcore label Neophyte Records, with headhoncho Evil Activities. He also did a lot of parties and festivals. \r\n\r\nWhen they both had a gig at the same event in Moscow they started talking about doing something complete different. \r\n\r\nBack home they started working on it and together with Fyona, a singer/songwriter who worked on a complete other project the first 2 tracks were born. \r\n\r\nAt the dancefair 2013 in utrecht they received some very positive feedback by labels like Protocol (Nicky Romero) and EMI so they knew they had to go on with this. \r\n\r\nIn March 2014 the first 2 releases came out and the first gigs are a fact too.",

  "artist_bio": "We play and create music for the dance floor, without wandering off from our own path. We just want to make people dance: nothing more, nothing less.One cold Saturday in 2007, two likeminded personalities decided to combine forces by sticking their heads together to create a track after both having operated solo for over a decade. From that moment, Audiowomb was born.\r\n\r\nWhat started off as a musical try-out, developed rapidly into a concept, a dj team, and above all: a friendship between two musicians.\r\n\r\n‘We complement each other very well. Our individual skills and focus, combined with our mutual experience in both mixing and producing, quickly emerged as a powerful combination,' Sten says. ‘From that point on we decided to create all our music under the Audiowomb moniker. Shortly after came the decision to team up as dj's as well.'\r\n\r\nDue to their shared passion for deep, raw and hypnotizing sounds, they always strive to integrate that specific ‘Audiowomb sound’ in both their dj sets and their productions. \r\n‘One cannot translate these elements into words,' Jeroen claims. ‘Music is emotion, a gut feeling. A track either has ‘it’, or not.’\r\n\r\n'Technological development pushes the growth and progression of the electronic music industry fast forward and has already formed a wide range of different styles and genres. It keeps this music scene dynamic and interesting. We play and create music for the dance floor, without wandering off from our own path. We just want to make people dance: nothing more, nothing less.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAudiowomb performed alongside: Sasha Carassi, Marco Bailey, Knobs, Steve Rachmad, Pig & Dan, Egbert, Luetzenkirchen, Anton Pieete, Mike Wall, Tom Hades, and many others.\r\n\r\nAudiowomb performed at: Studio 80 Amsterdam, Undercurrent - Amsterdam, Chicago Social Club - Amsterdam, Korsakoff - Amsterdam, Boom Chicago - Amsterdam, TWSTd – Amsterdam, Mp3 Live – Amsterdam, Catwalk – Rotterdam, Bootleg DJ Café – Rotterdam, Victorie - Alkmaar, Tivoli de Helling - Utrecht, Dock 154 – Utrecht, ACU – Utrecht, Luxor Live - Arnhem, Club Purple – Arnhem, Klup - Groningen, Talent Factory – Den Bosch, De Boulevard – Breda, Fenix – Sittard, Estrado – Harderwijk, Kunstkeller - Giessen (DE), and many more.\r\n",

It all started as two friends sharing the same passion for house music started collaborating together. These two dj's met each other in the Dutch underground house scene around the year 2000. They immediately had a huge click. In 2005 they started producing underground house music and building their own repertoire combining their productions with minimal & techhouse, techno influences.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 2010 they started their own record label called Flatlife Wired. On this label they already released several tracks and did some remixes for other producers and dj's on national and international level.\r\n\r\nIn 2013 J. decided to continue with Audiowire solo.\r\n\r\nFor Audiowire it is very important to make warm deep housemusic and share this with the rest of the world.

Watse had a great passion for Chicago, Jackin' & Deep House, while Sebastian prefers Tech House & Techno with some groovy bass lines. Together with saxophonist Bas Gerzon and bass guitar player Joost Manger Cats they know how to please the crowd by playing a nice combination of the finest tunes. Their home studio's in The Hague and Rotterdam are the places where those guys experiment with vocals, samples played by Bas & Joost, techy synths and nice grooves!

He experienced the development of housemusic from Chicago, New-beat, Acid, Hardcore, Trance  to the current  styles.\r\n\r\nHe had his residency in a small club back in the nineties, where he played all kinds of music from disco/soul to early house music.\r\nHe became infected with the House /trance virus, and started playing on bigger parties and in various clubs in Belgium and Holland. \r\n\r\nDue to his other career, he had to stop and took a long break of nearly ten years, but never stopped loving the house music.\r\nFrom 2008 he resumed playing his techno/tribal styled music again on various parties.\r\n\r\n2 years ago, he switched from playing with Vinyl and CD's to playing with a 4-track digital system Traktor , and developed his music into the current style he plays now :  \r\n\r\nAn energetic blend of deep, groovy and minimal techno & electro that integrates southern elements in rhythms and colorful patterns in sound,  inspired by DJ's like Luciano, Ricardo Villalobos, Michel Cleis, Reboot.",

His tracks are oldskool but modern, they’re deep but dancefloor-effective. He doesn’t limit himself to one style, though he’s no “trendhopper”. While producing house, deephouse, techhouse and even techno, all his productions have something in common that together makes one recognizable sound.\r\n\r\nThis wide sound got Amro some great gigs, like playing at Joris Voorn’s homebase Atak, Utrecht’s techno-venue Tivoli, the Escape Venue, BLM9, Studio 80, Odeon but also at some very big festivals.\r\n\r\nBas Amro started producing at the age of 12 and bought his first set of decks at his 14th, but inspite him being relatively young, you won’t hear this in his sets and productions. Amro is highly influenced by the roots of the Chicago and Detroit sound which brought him to getting lots of respect and support by the bigger names like Jimpster, Deetron, Laurent Garnier, Radio Slave, John Digweed, Darko Esser, Osunlade, and the list keeps getting bigger!",

  "artist_bio": "Boris Werner: a charismatic leading figure of the house music scene, who is forever young at heart. He has promised himself he will continue to keep pushing dance floors and promoters worldwide.Dutch DJ Boris Werner’s love for house music runs deep - so deep, that his passion for house music is evident in every set he plays. A venue-filling personality with a decade of experience - armed with releases starting with his first one on Remote Area and continuing on Supplement Facts, Rush Hour, Moon Harbour, Soweso, Get Physical and a residency at the world famous club TROUW – his eager performances and crowd-pleasing antics keep him in high demand across dance floors the world over, from DC-10 to Studio 80 and beyond. Cutting his teeth across some of the most influential nights in Holland, his flawless reputation to work any crowd has marked him as an exciting figure - one that’s ready to inject club-land with a refreshing, restless approach to the dance floor.\r\n\r\nBoris’ skill as a DJ sees him blend all strains of house - from percussive funk to bass heavy grooves – delivered with effortless ease. With influences as diverse and broad as Arthur Russell to ‘90s golden era hip hop, Boris produces top-quality club experiences, delivered with sparkling personality, daring diversity and a well-honed ear for delivering a memorable party - time and time again.\r\n\r\nAfter becoming a permanent fixture on Amsterdam’s scene, Boris soon began co-hosting the city’s legendary MONO parties with Lauhaus & Aron Friedman in 2002. This paved the way for a pivotal residency in 2005 at Vreemd, the legendary weekday party at Amsterdam's club Sugar Factory. Every Thursday, the crowds would hang of his every kick & bassline, all at the mercy of his endless expertise and razor sharp techniques. It’s a slot he didn’t miss for four years straight all the way through to 2009 – no wonder the crowds love his dedicated attitude and fun-filled vibe. \r\n\r\nIn October 2010, Boris ‘Wip Wap’ Werner played a huge 10 hour set to celebrate 10 years of musical genius at the legendary Studio 80. Giving the crate-digger a chance to take the crowd through a myriad of his sounds and styles, the night’s success was followed up in 2011 with an 11 hour stint, before a 15 and a half hour marathon in 2012. Whether he’s DJing ALL NIGHT or spending days on end in the studio, Boris displays passionate dedication and unrivalled knowledge in all he does – the stuff that’s the envy of his peers, all wondering what the restless DJ’s next trick will be.\r\n\r\nHis reputation as a DJ’s DJ has helped Boris to conquer clubs, events & festivals all over Europe. After gaining wind of his rising name, Boris was invited to play for the biggest clubbing brand in the world, CircoLoco, a spot he’s regularly helmed over the past three years at Ibiza’s legendary DC-10. Spreading love through his carefully honed art, Boris’s global reputation continues to grow after slaying the Likes of Sankeys New York, Truth South Africa, D-Edge Brazil, Mysteryland Chile and The BPM Festival Mexico besides dozens more. Together with a credible selection of tunes and remix credits (including Renato Cohen, C-Rock, Tom Trago and Matthias Tanzmann to name a few), Boris displays the hallmarks of a rising force in contemporary dance music.\r\n\r\nBack at home in Amsterdam (alongside close friend & rising figure William Kouam Djoko) Mr Werner has called the curtain on ‘Late Night Society’, a party set at Amsterdam’s coolest underground club, Trouw.  dOP, Ion Ludwig, Tom Trago, Jamie Jones, Tom Ruijg, Robert James, Visionquest, Lee Curtis, Mr G, Mathew Jonson, Wareika, Thomas Martojo, San Proper Guillaume & The Coutu Dumonts, Soundstream and Seth Troxler have all joined the pair as guests, purporting a ‘dress up chic, act like trash’ motto at the fabled club that’s become the buzz of the town. \r\n\r\nStraight off the back of a lengthy touring schedule that included a Dutch record breaking 22 hour DJ set at Studio 80, Amsterdam’s finest after-hours champion is back with a two track EP on Voyage Direct (the label of his Amsterdam friend Tom Trago), bringing his eclectic, visionary blend of techno clout, house rhythm and rolling effect all delivered in triumphant, leftfield fashion.\r\n\r\n2015 also sees the next phase in Boris Werner’s trajectory as he takes his party aesthetic further around the world, demonstrating himself as an artist and DJ within the wider, global clubbing scene.",

  "artist_bio": "Since 2003 Dutch producer Jerzz is active in the Techno-scene. In the past years he had many releases via creative common license at legendary net labels like: Rohformat, Subcologic, Edensonic, FOEM, Supersix and many more. His sound is typicaly twisted with a nasty bite, always deep, hard edged and raw. \r\nJerzz, Nikolaj Darja, KrZik, Roald Zahl are a few of his aliases that have developed themselves over the years to the point where he is now. He has mastered the tricks of the trade and refined his own style by doing a lot of producing and especially by experimenting a lot. Like a lot of people he has been unemployed at home for a few years, and because of this Jerzz has had plenty of time to really refine his music. The reason Jerzz makes Techno is because Techno means innovation to him.\r\nIn fact, this actually has nothing to do with what he listens to mostly as his taste is very broad. Experimenting has made sure he knows the available equipment through and through, and because he was busy with it day and night he was able to create his own distinctive Techno sound, while not limiting himself by working in other genres like House and Dub-Step too. With his tracks beeing played by famous Techno jockeys like Oliver Lieb, Claude Young and Dave Clark (who recently played 2 of his tracks in the weekly dance radio-show ‘White Noise’ on 3FM; one of Holland’s most listened radiostations) Jerzz’s his music is bound to make an impact and leave a lasting impression, A quality Producer, (re-)Mixer and live-performer, who is involved in various collaborative projects, Jerzz is a man to keep an eye on when it comes to hypno-energetic dark Techno! *Jerzzno*",

As a DJ and producer unit they began operating under the name Beesmunt Soundsystem and haven’t looked back since. With three releases planned for 2015 and the continuation of their own club night ‘Soundmachine’ (formerly at Amsterdam’s most renowned club, Trouw) it looks like Beesmunt Soundsystem is keeping the momentum going. More info coming soon…\r\n\r\nBookings: stroes@meanwhile.nl\r\nManagement: mo@momanager.nlMusical doublets David van der Leeuw and Luigi Vittorio Jansen are two friends from the city of Amsterdam who combined forces and got together in 2008. As a DJ and producer unit they began operating under the name Beesmunt Soundsystem and haven’t looked back since.\r\n\r\nWhat sets them apart is their unique approach when they are in the DJ booth controlling the music and navigating the crowd. Their versatility allowed them to play at a plethora of places, from bars to clubs, fashion shows to festivals. At the mere age of 18, both gentlemen already had their own night at the famous Paradiso venue. As the rep grew bigger, so did the crowds, the parties and the festivals (Lowlands, Welcome to the Future, Amsterdam Dance Event, Dekmantel), even taking them across the border: Paris, London, Bristol, Cannes, Berlin, Antwerp, Istanbul, Lausanne, Bern and Malta are just a selection of places they’ve blessed with their original sounds.\r\n\r\nThis progress in the realms of dance music also inspired the fellows to advance and develop their own productions and remixes. Always trying to create a balanced but surprising mix within house and techno. Sometimes deep and dubby other times bright and warm.\r\n\r\nBy building their own studio in the centre of Amsterdam, The Beesmunt Soundsystem has a place to experiment and evolve. Studio neighbor Tom Trago, a well respected DJ and producer himself, was now at hand to provide further guidance in the world of house music the duo fell in love with. They released their first ‘Circulation’ EP in 2012 and their second ‘All Day’ in the summer of 2013, also released by Soweso Music. The EP received great feedback and the title track got featured in Breach’s DJ Kicks.\r\n\r\nIn april 2014 they released their third EP named “The Baby Maker EP’ on the Bristol based Just Jack label. The EP got ranked 4/5 stars by Resident Advisor and received great feedback and support from various angles. The track ‘Close To Me’ got remixed by Amir Alexander, but it’s ‘How I Wish’ that is picked up best and can be considered an underground hit. Through ‘The Baby Maker’ Beesmunt Soundsystem gained the right attention to play at clubs and festivals like: Corsica Studios(LDN), Chalet(BER), Just Jack(BRS), Soenda and Mysteryland just to name a few. In September 2014 they released their fourth EP ‘Body Shape’ on Pets Recordings. The EP balances between big room and underground, a sublime blend between house and techno. With three releases planned for 2015 and the continuation of their own club night ‘Soundmachine’ (formerly at Amsterdam’s most renowned club, Trouw) it looks like Beesmunt Soundsystem is keeping the momentum going.

In their two year existence the duo played over 100 gigs across the Netherlands and shared the stage with famous national and international dj’s such as Mightyfools, Afrojack, Fukkk Offf and Sound Of Stereo. Beat The Bastardz played at huge (national) festivals like Lowlands, Defqon1 and Dancetour Tilburg. The duo is resident of Wildgroei, one of the most popular monthly dance nights in Utrecht. Energy in performance and track selection is the key element in their live-sets. Starting off with mainly electro bangers, the duo nowadays combines electro with techno, acid and dubstep. But whatever style they spin, they all have one thing in common: (raw) energy! Beat The Bastardz released their first official EP called Lumberjack on November 4th 2011 exclusive on Beatport by Little Globe Records with remixes of Le Boeuf, De Cultuurbarbaren and Mordalski. The Lumberjack EP got support by DJ's such as Sick Boy, DJ Gomes and Boef en de Gelogeerde Aap. Also was the Le Boeuf Remix featured on 22 Tracks and 3VOOR12 Luisterpaal. Their acid remix of Sick Boy & Eric Sharps track Sharp As A Knife will soon be released by a soon to be announced major label.",

Binnen verkeert een kleine kudde nachtnomaden. Moe. Voldaan ook. Bonken van buiten hebben hen niet bereikt.\r\n\r\nHoewel velen van hen het om wisselende redenen zullen ontkennen waren allen die zondagochtend getuige van het ontstaan van het Bos & Lommer Soundsystem. Het schijnt dat er behoorlijk dol werd gedaan die nacht: naar verluidt werden er tracks gerockt waarvan men niet echt wist dat men ze wilde horen.\r\n\r\nJaren zijn gepasseerd sinds die vruchtbare julizondag. Het waren de jaren waarin het Bos & Lommer Soundsystem zich heeft kunnen ontwikkelen in de veilig-wanende schemering van het amateurisme. Jagers op verscholen muzikale genres, exotisch of van weleer, verzamelaars van de dansbare parels die deze genres vaker rijk zijn dan je zou denken. Waar er binnen besloten kring werd genoten ontwikkelde een sterke drang te delen in het muzikale avontuur. Onder een tikkie te fancy, doch affichewaardig alias trekt het Soundsystem daarom thans als Bolo Sosy op discosafari door de nachten van Amsterdam en daarbuiten, nog steeds rockend op de tracks waarvan men niet echt wist dat men ze wilde horen.\r\n\r\nVoeg je bij de Bolo karavaan, en al dansend brengt zij je over vertrouwde elektronische paden via onvoorzien uitheemse zijwegen tot een occasional guilty pleasure. Tot snel. En een goede nacht.\r\n\r\n// Bookings: Michan Tolman — michan@saleskracht.nl\r\n// PR: Wouter van Eenbergen — woutervaneenbergen@gmail.com",

As a pioneering leader of the international house scene, his top quality productions are mainstays of countless hype charts and well represented in the boxes of international top dj's.\r\n\r\nThe BORN TO FUNK sound started drawing critical acclaim after the release of such notable hits as Di Bamba on Knee Deep USA, You Rock Da House on Elan Records and Souma Bana on Soulfuric Trax. Soon the attention of top notch artists in the business was drawn, and since then musical luminaries like Simon Dunmore, Ron Carroll, Davidson Opsina, Ian Carey, Justin Michael and many more, turned to BORN TO FUNK to remix their tracks. All recognizing the unique groove and high quality production level, making BORN TO FUNK Holland's most in demand remixer and producer of today.\r\n\r\nHighlights include remixing the all time house classic \"Rise\" (Soul Providers) and working with house legends such as Ron Carroll, Tyree Cooper and Byron Stingily. Over the years he has released tracks on Knee Deep, Soulfuric, Hermosa, Fluential, BMC, Look At You, R&G Electronics, Gfab, Ospina Records, Gotta Keep Faith, MN2S, Hed Kandi, G-Rex, among others, and he became the first Dutch act to ever appear on the famous Swiss label Purple Music, establishing a solid name in the high-end segment of the house music industry.\r\n\r\nBesides working with the best producers and labels in the scene, BORN TO FUNK tracks and remixes have also found their way onto many compilations like \"Testament Of House\" (Ministry Of Sound), \"Wax Wars\" (Defected), \"Hed Kandi\" (Base Ibiza and Disco Kandi), \"The Flavour/TheVibe\" (Stonebridge), \"MTV Ibiza\", and \"In Bed With Space\" (Ibiza) to name a few.\r\n\r\nAs a DJ, Ferdinand Lijnkamp (dj-ing under his BORN TO FUNK monicker) is a veteran of the business with over 20 years of experience under his belt and currently performing about 100 gigs a year in and outside The Netherlands. Back in the days, he started out as a dedicated disco/soul/funk dj and is known for his immense collection of rare and classic 12 inches. No surprise his love for soulful music still is a big influence in his house sets. He has played all major venues in Holland and beyond, including clubs like Pacha (Ibiza), Amika (Miami), Patipa (Kiev), Trilogy (Dubai), TuTu Tango (Curacao), Supperclub (Bangkok), Mass (Seoul) and El Divino (Ibiza). In Holland, popular events like Housequake, Defected in The House, Hed Kandi, House Republica and Super Sunday feature his spinning talent on a regular basis, and besides holding several residencies he performs regularly at major festivals like Dancevalley, Sensation White, and Extrema Outdoor.\r\n\r\nHis experience, fine taste in music and dazzling 4-deck dj skills, got Hardsoul's Dj Roog nickname him 'King of Acapellas' and is getting hands up in the air wherever he plays the funky sounds of BORN TO FUNK.",

While pioneer electronic artists where inventing techno and house music around that time.........Conceptualist and DJ Ben Komor was born in 1985 in Tokyo, Japan.  After a few years, he and his family moved to the United States, where they lived in Boston. While pioneer electronic artists where inventing techno and house music around that time, Ben spent most of his time in Kindergarten where classical artists such as Yo-Yo Ma musically rendered his perceptual development.\r\n\r\nAt the tender age 8 he moved to the Netherlands, where he now practised the violin, to further enhance his holistic understanding of music and the world of sound in general.  The Chemical Brothers “Block Rockin Beats” release in 1997 marks a turning point in Ben's life.  A whole new immense electronic sound scape was now rapidly unraveling and expanding itself for Ben.  Artists such as:  Aphix Twin, Fatboy Slim, Orbital and the Prodigy where now starting to absorb his full attention. As a result in 1999 he swapped his violin for a pair of decks where he discovered and quickly flew with the infinite possibilities that electronic music now provided to him.\r\n\r\nIt was only a matter of time and in truth a foregone conclusion that he  would become obsessed with the sound of techno, being heavily inspired by legends such as Jeff Mills, Laurent Garnier, Speedy J and Richie Hawtin. In 2002 his first gigs became fact and his alter ego “Kartikeya” was born. It refers to a Hindu god of war who was created by Shiva to destroy the demons, representing the negative tendencies and energies held within most human beings.\r\n\r\nThe symbolism of Kartikeya points to the ways and means of reaching perfection, a mission Ben strives to accomplish in music and life. After high school he moved to London for a year where he studied electronic music at the Academy of Contemporary Music. Musically this was a seminally important year for him being exposed to the nuances  styles of UK's electronic music.\r\n\r\nHe started experimenting with different genres like house and minimal, which eventually lead him to creating his own far more versatile approach towards music. In 2004 he moved back to the Netherlands and he started studying psychology in Amsterdam, the city where he has been residing ever since. By closely witnessing the revival of the underground techno scene in Amsterdam, he met lots of like-minded creative dare we say bohemian people.\r\n\r\nDuring this period he teamed up with lifetime buddy and partner in crime Jop. Their mutual love for music resulted in the infamous Particle gonzo journalism; interviewing numerous artists across the globe, as well deciding to start organizing. Nowadays he's the organizer and resident DJ behind the successful Carnivale nights at Studio 80. With bookings on Mr Stubnitz, Paradiso and Dance Valley Festival in 2009, his career appears to be lifting off at a  rapid pace.\r\n\r\nWhile constantly striving for innovation and a better understanding of music as a whole, he has developed himself throughout the years into an artist who knows his way with the crowd. Energetic, deep, rhythmic and the unexpected are the keywords that perfectly reflect Ben's sound in no better way. In other words: \"Simply be unhindered in expressing yourself.\"",

  "artist_bio": "Beau (18) is a composer/artist based in Rotterdam\r\nBeau (18) discovered his great love for music on a young age. At the age of nine he bought hisself a piano and began to write original compositions. He performed his songs with the orchestra (SKVR jeugdorkest) in which he played the piano. He opened the 'Gergiev Festival' in 2006 with a piano solo piece and became a member of the 'Talentgroup of Rotterdam'. As a member of the talentgroup he got masterclasses about classical music and music theory. He also gained more experience with performances. \r\n\r\nAfter 2 years of the Talentgroup he noticed that he wanted more than the 'old school' classical way of music. Garageband and a simple MIDI-controller made the change. He wanted to be Beau Zwart, instead of Mozart.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of creating all the parts of a piece of music became an addiction. He spended hours in his bedroom making the most diverse styles of music. The music he made was very layered. Because off the layers the name 'Complexo' came up. His dream always was to make an electronic orchestra that played his 'Complexo' music.\r\n\r\nDuring his time on high school he discovered a new love: Party. He loved the way people react on tracks in clubs. It looked like the easiest way to test and bring your music to people. The concept of being a DJ was not enough. Beau wanted to do more during an performance. The idea of edit and play elements on the fly was born. This is why he brings his first love, the piano, with him during live sets.",

Back in those days when the wheels of steel were the only instrument of choice for a dj. At an age of only just 15 he already played marathon sets at clubs where he was by far too young for to visit as a guest. Those years he built the foundation for what became his unique quality to feel the vibe and read venues, events and crowds in order to take complete control, both in spot lights or stealth mode. This is why Ben Lowdain is the perfect warm up dj, while he as easily takes peak hour time slot shifts. He is blessed with a fine ear for picking just those distinctive tracks that became a trademark for his distinguish style and sets which can best be summarized by groove, lots of groove! From the deeper side of house to the pounding beats of techno, Mr. Lowdain throws in elements of electro, high tech soul, acid, breaks, rave and even drum and bass. Both effortless and dangerous, but always very effective. No matter how deep or rough it gets, his ongoing groove is the common denominator to give his sets that intangible but recognizable energy.\r\n\r\nFor over ten years he has been the driving force and resident dj of the legendary SOLK Quality Drum and Bass Events, which brought the world finest dnb artist and dj’s to The Netherlands. In 2012 he started the Vaarwater events together with Boembap Acency in order to spread his sound of deeper house and techno.",

A live-set? Yes, a live-set.

Playing the freshest, most exciting tunes and adding layers of digital manipulation using some seriously swanky kit, his performances are something that must be witnessed to understand their full force.\r\n\r\nA trio of early releases show that his standards as a producer are equally high. It’s All Sorted (Cr2), Vet Slim (Kaiserdisco’s label Takt) and Kiss (2mr2) are all dance records of the highest calibre. Mason effortlessly delivers blindingly good techhouse and techno records that are easily as good as anything else that is being released right now.\r\n\r\nGet the lowdown on Billy Mason’s style by tuning into his worldwide radio show, the Billy Mason Monthly Mash. Accessible via the artist’s website, he takes to the airwaves on a regular basis to serve up gigantic, tasty slabs of epic techhouse and techno. Pounding, aggressive and totally danceable, this show is a sure-fire way of setting the tone for a serious night out and a great introduction to Mason’s brutally effective way of working.\r\n\r\nBilly’s mission is to pour a steady stream of sweet basslines and beats into the ears of music lovers everywhere. Don’t argue – just listen.",

His trademark sound is very immersive; analog, warm, with a high concentration on ambience and space.

Soon after, the rest of the world cottoned on and a Top 10 position on Beatport’s chart soon followed for an incredible 4 months! As such, like Rawthectic, Monique Musique and Memoria Recordings all soon got in touch for more music.\r\nAs a DJ, Bjorn’s style snakes between tech house, melodic techno and deeper house, and has seen him play across Europe. As if that wasn’t enough, in 2012 Bjorn became a member of the underground Label Memoria Recordings, at the same time as releasing plenty of new productions on respected outlets.",

In short a DJ from whom you can expect edges of raw funk and downplayed techno in his dj sets.His interest in electronic music started almost before he could ride a bicycle - already bopping about (at 200bpm) to the early sounds of the Dutch hardcore movement and buying CD's of his Thunderdome heroes by the age of 10. Logical then, that he dedicated himself to playing music soon after his first contact behind the decks. Infusing his musical tastes ranging anywhere from hip hop and rap to techno and house music - melodic elements that run as a thread throughout his DJ sets.\r\n\r\n“I decided for myself I’m not going to play to follow any hypes or to please anybody else. I just want to play what I believe is good. That’s when I started experimenting with different sounds” – a sound which now represents BEEK, a personal and intimate sound which showcase his delicate mixing skills in his energetic sets. BEEK has transformed himself to a sophisticated DJ from whom you can expect edges of raw funk and downplayed techno in his house sets. \r\n\r\nLooking back on 2013, BEEK holds great memories to Buiten Westen, Amsterdam Open Air, Magneet Festival, two gigs at his second ADE, as well as his Berlin debut. We are looking forward for his grooves to take over Amsterdam in the coming year, as well as for BEEK to elaborate his vision on music at a new monthly concept called SALON at the new club WGT. A low-key music platform where respected artists will be put in the spotlight for 3 hour sets. Whether you go to one of his gigs, or his club night at SALON, BEEK will provide the music that makes you groove.",

His diversity doesn’t end at his heritage, being the son of a Slovenian father and Dutch/Japanese mother, but translates through his music. From buzzing electronica and Chicago house to warm and grooving techno and beyond, Ceze is one to think outside of the box.",

While the most sensible thing to ask would actually be: “WHO is Brand!?”. Though this question is, yet again, unanswerable since Brand! is partly machine.\r\n\r\nStill, as with all roots and routes, nothing comes from nowhere. Growing up as a kid in a designer family, Brand! realised at an early stage that he didn’t need to adapt to his environment. Instead, his environment could adapt to him; resulting in rather awkward home videos from age 4 through 10. Luckily, at an age of 11, Brand! received a bonus gift with his first empty bank-account: E-jay music software. This resulted in a slightly darker period of self-expression and if Facebook were to exist back in the 90s; some serious loss of friend-requests.\r\n\r\nAll it took then was for Brand! to understand that there could be more people but himself that might enjoy computer music. And by god did they do! \r\nSo straight from his living room right up the legs dancing in the most derelict clubs he went. To arrive, severely damaged, at the sheer bliss he enjoys today.\r\n\r\nFinally, skipping through the confusing paradigms, one soon realises that \r\nto capture Brand!’s sound in words would only bring us further from the truth. \r\nYour most viable option to consider is therefore probably to go and listen to his \r\nmusic. Enjoy.",

  "artist_bio": "Ch²/Channel 2 is a English Techno/Tech House DJ/Producer living in Amsterdam, Netherlands.Jon Gordon aka Ch² began to dj around 1997. He soon had his first gigs playing a combination of breaks, house and techno in Norwich. In Late 1997, along with some close friends he started the club night Bionic Soup, which at it’s infancy it’s style was more breaks, house and techno. Later, Bionic Soup became best known for it’s harder side, Acid Techno.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the 90’s Jon moved to Brighton to study Music Technology where he met up with his school friend Will Holmes. Over the next 5 years Jon & Will collaborated on and released a number of House and Techno records on various record labels including Tekktonn Records.\r\nIn 2004 Jon & Will started to put together a live pa (Channel 2) using hardware instruments and software which eventually over time transformed into a combination of using original material mixed with other productions. At this time, along with playing their live pa at events and parties they also had a long standing radio show on Transmission FM. \r\n\r\nIn 2011 Jon (along with some like minded friends) started a club night project called Beta. The purpose of Beta was to promote the Minimal, Tech House, Techno and Electro scene in East Anglia by showcasing local talent. Jon is now living in Amsterdam where he is currently working on new techno productions and continues to promote and perform at dance music events.",

Not only has he enriched the city’s nightlife with a series of refreshing initiatives, breaking new artists from abroad and pushing a young generation of local talent. He’s also managed to become one of Holland’s most respected and loved underground dj’s, setting dancefloors aflame across the Netherlands and abroad.\r\n\r\nThe variety of influences marking his upbringing (Chilean parents, childhood in Holland) is still reflected in his dj-style: a hybrid of different genres, spanning from techno to thumping house. As Carlos is regularly playing most of Holland's leading festivals and venues, more and more people are starting to embrace his extraordinary blend of sexy grooves. And with recent appearances at some of Europe’s leading clubs (Panoramabar, Robert Johnson, Fellini, D Edge, Dama de Ferro, Planetarium) and festivals and events like (Awakenings Festival, Innercity, Cadenza Labelnight, 5daysOff, Mysteryland, Free Your Mind), his first flirts in the studio (together with Julien Chaptal on Remote Area and , and the launch of his own label Studio Soulrock (together with Steffi) the future looks bright.\r\n\r\nCarlos has been playing an active role in nightlife from an early age. His company Studio Soulrock (founded in 2000) has organised many parties in cities across the Netherlands, and hosted stages at some of the country's leading festivals. His Vreemd clubnights have been Amsterdam's most popular Thursdays for almost four years now. They inspired Carlos to start Soulrock Bookings, which is currently representing a bunch of promising (inter)national artists in Holland and abroad, including himself.\r\n\r\nThe latest chapter in Soulrock history is the founding of Studio Soulrock together with DJ Steffi. The first release by Bootleg Bitches hailed support from dj's and critics worldwide and a second release by San Proper & Steven de Peven (remixes by Pitto and Steffi, due 2009) is already being played by lots of dj's. Carlos himself was featured as a vocalist on Julien Chaptal's widely acclaimed album Tokens. The next step for him is a release with Sandrien, Aron Friedman and even solo, which should express his superb musical taste even better.\r\n\r\nstroes@meanwhile.nl",

It is for this reason that he is a producer who is happy to lock himself down and work on a track for days on end, honing and honing his music for maximum dancefloor effect.\r\n\r\nAfter many years of practicing and collecting experiences, the man has now released on imprints including Act Natural Records, Serkal, Natural Rhythm, Inmotion, Deep Tech, Klopfgeist, Tzinah and Steve Lawler’s ever on point VIVA music label, collecting praise from players like Tini, Loco Dice, Hector, Gel Abril, Brothers Vibe, Matthew Dekay and Maya Jane Coles along the way. And it’s no real surprise given the aesthetics of his music, house and techno beats with jazzy influences, deft percussive details and a true sense of groove all permeate his sounds and make your mind work as much as your heel. \r\n\r\nReleases such as these have understandably brought a lot of attention Camiel’s way, and as such he is an ever more in-demand live and dj act having first cut his teeth on the Dutch scene. Now you’ll find him playing across Europe in Germany, England, Malta, Ibiza and Poland, often weaving together sets made up primarily of his own unique productions.... Paradigm, Studio 80, Amsterdam Open Air festival, Rockit Open Air Festival, Have a Nice Day Festival, Out- door Stereo Festival, Catwalk Rotterdam, Katerholzig (GER), Wilde Renate (GER), Reineke Fuchs (GER), Public Life (UK), Brixton Clubhouse (UK), Café 1001 (UK), Zoo Project (Ibiza), Club Anonymous (MALTA), Sunscape Festival (MALTA) are just some of the places to have fallen under his spell in recent times.\r\n\r\nLooking to the future is just a good a prospect for Camiel: he has more productions and remixes lined-up for tastemaker labels and he is working on his first album.\r\n\r\n\r\nBookings:\r\n\r\nWorldwide: Hessel@paradigm050.com",

  "artist_bio": "Kevin Huizing AKA Budakid is a Tilburg based music producer/dj.Kevin Huizing AKA Budakid is a Tilburg based music producer/dj. Coming from a very musical family, it was only a matter of time before young Budakid started playing an instrument of his own. As a drummer in a drum ensemble, the soon-to-be producer/dj got his first taste of beats and he wanted more. Having a good sense of rhythm helped him as a fledgling dj. Before long, Budakid landed his first residency in one of Utrecht’s most popular clubs. Although he wasn’t of legal age, several clubs asked him to perform and Budakid showed his promise by measuring up to peers twice his age.\r\n\r\nBut as it happens with a lot of dj’s, only dj’ing wasn’t enough for his own musical output. So Budakid sought out to prove his worth as a self-taught producer. Influenced by the likes of Todd Terje, Stimming, Jimpster and acts such as Tame Impala, Tycho and Caribou, the Dutchman developed a very melodic style of his own. A typical Budakid song has a funky groove, the right set of chords and some strong, positive vibes all mashed together. All this made him a crowd favorite at festivals like Solar, Indian Summer and Kindergarten and clubs such as Melkweg Amsterdam and Thuishaven, Effenaar Eindhoven.\r\n\r\nHis music has been already supported by heavyweights such as Tensnake, Oliver Schories, Einmusik, Guy J and Claptone. That’s something that didn’t happen overnight. Budakid’s tracks have been released on respected labels like Einmusika, Jalapeño Records and Manual Music. Well-known blogs including Indieshuffle, Purple Sneakers and VICE’s Thump are very enthusiastic about the producer’s tracks with Thump even offering him an exclusive premiere. So it’s safe to say Budakid isn’t just another kid on the block. Already regarded as a more than reliable producer/dj by his peers, nothing stands in the way of Budakid to become one of the greats.",

  "artist_bio": "Bram Tierie was born in the city of Nijmegen, a small town in the east of the Netherlands. He started mixing house music at the early age of sixteen. The house music, starting off as a hobby, turned into a passion and even became a way life. Bram has played his music in many clubs all over the Netherlands. The last couple of years he has also found his way outside the Netherlands. With Gigs in Germany, Spain and The Philippines he has spread his sound across borders!During the years, Bram being active as a DJ, he has developed his sound to what it is now. He likes to describe his own style of house as a combination of deep rolling basses and bouncy melodies reaching within the genres of deep, tech and UK house. Performing at many different clubs and festivals throughout the years he managed to keep his own style while meeting the demands of the different crowds.\r\n\r\nThis year (2013) Bram Tierie Launched his own concept in Amsterdam called Beatroom. Beatroom is a concept that gives talented upcoming deejays a stage amongst already established deejays in the industry. Bram’s main goal with Beatroom is to blend different styles of house together and give the visitors an unforgettable night out.\r\n\r\nWhat excites Bram the most during his live performances is the improvisation needed to meet the vibe of the evening. This is what determines how he builds up to just the right-timed climax guaranteeing crowds to go crazy. During his live performances he likes to combine existing music with his own productions.\r\n\r\nThe last couple of years Bram Tierie have really grown into producing. Having releases on different labels worldwide he has spread his songs across borders. From his first release until this moment he has been spending a lot of time in the studio, making new solo tracks and working with different artists ending up in some interesting collaborations.\r\n\r\nThe future promises many new productions (and collaborations) with innovative twists, the Bram Tierie-sound!",

Like Omar Souleyman meeting Sean Paul and Aphex Twin at a wedding party. It has the live power of punk rock shows and early house parties.\r\n\r\nIn their first year Cairo Liberation Front produced mixtapes that premiered at WDR (German national radio), The Quietus, Playground Magazine (biggest Spanish pop medium) and leading world music blogs like Afropop Worldwide, Generation Bass and Okay Africa.\r\n\r\nOn stage Cairo Liberation Front performs with one DJ, one MC and one hypeman (a colonel). Sometimes they are joined by belly dancers, döner vendors and other friends. The collective is known for their highly energetic live performances. In their first year they played more then 40 times in whole Europe, from underground clubs to big festivals. Join the revolution and say Yalla!\r\n",

This love of house, deep house and tech house on the razor’s edge has now brought them together behind the decks.\r\n\r\nAnd luckily so, because both ladies know damn well how to whip up a crowd. The joy these two radiate from the booth is simply infectious. Put them behind the wheels of steel, and you know the floor is going to get cooking.\r\n\r\nWith a roaring festival summer coming up , being residents at Club NYX  the “Diepzinnig, Koekoek & Thuishaven”  and  hosting their own stage at Amsterdam Dance Event, nothing can stand in the way of Cat Carpenters’ world domination.",

  "artist_bio": "Brian S. is a very popular and prolific DJ in the (inter)national house scene. Known for his infectious, groovy club-style of spinning he takes over parties all over the globe. He started spinning in 1995 at the famous IT club in Amsterdam with DJ Jean and Marcello and it didn't take long before he started building his reputation and landed bookings.  At parties Brian S. is quite a personality; with his extremely funky grooves, positive vibe and his ability to immediately take hold of the crowd, he gets the dance floor going in no time!He considers himself a man with vision… \r\nHe started spinning with cd's in early 90's as the first (Dutch) cd spinning DJ, and has always played ahead off the average, creating a playlist for a wide variety of clientele…   His track record is proof of his success: all the Dutch hotspots, such as Club Air, Chemistry, (the now defunct) RoXY, Club NL, Jimmy Woo, and Paradiso (Amsterdam), MTC, Now&Wow (Rotterdam) and Stalker, Bloomingdale (Haarlem). Organizations like ID&T, Hed Kandi and Chemistry have booked him frequently for years now. \r\n\r\nClub Love (still the best underground party since \"Studio 54\"!) and in the early days of the Supperclub… Brian S. was one of the pioneers who gave this legendary club it's unique sound!\r\n Brian S. has also played at various venues throughout the world, in cities such as Antwerp (Café d'Anvers), Paris (Palace and Follies Pigalle), Cannes (Film Festival), Porto (It), NYC (Twilo), Miami (WMC), Blue Marlin, Pasha, El Divino, KM5 (Ibiza), Prague, Barcelona and Cairo and many more parties in Israel, Austria (Snowbombing), Germany, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Russia and Thailand (Y2K party). Sensation, Innercity, MysteryLand, Dance Valley, Love Parade Berlin, Streetparade Zurich, Fast Forward Rotterdam and if that's not enough, Brian S. has worked with several musicians & mc's from all over the world. Besides all this Brian S. has been hosting the popular 'RUSH' (Raw Urban Sexy House) night at escape for 6 years. While DJ-Mag had all the big Dutch dj's in the Top-Ten in The last decade, RUSH was dominating the Dutch house scene! With the Sexy Tech House concept which is still being copied till today *Voted 3 Times Best Dutch Club night In A Row!!  \r\n\r\nSince the beginning of January 2010 he hosts a new club night called SHAKE 'N BAKE, with THICK TUNEZ & PHAT PANCAKES! This very popular concept created by him & Hero de Janeiro is monthly held in Club NL but has seen other places like Open Air, Magneetfestival, Undercurrent and more..    \r\n\r\nBut he isn't satisfied with just spinning records; he has also showcased his turntable wizardry during (live) projects with artists like Fedde Le Grand, Morillo, Audio Bullys, dr. Kutcho, Phatts & Small, Sneak, Gene Farris, Sven Väth, StoneBridge, Farley & Heller and many more.  Nowadays Brian spends a lot of time in the studio where he's in process of producing his first album, tracks and remixes. Like we said, Brian S. continues to broaden his musical horizon and to further explore the chemistry between the stage and the dance floor.  \r\n\r\nGirls and boys alike love this DJ, check him out in a venue near you...\r\n",

Finally, sound is the only way for Cardboard Motel to make sense of the world and stop worrying about his numerous other creative addictions.\r\n\r\nThis might explain why Cardboard Motel’s frequencies don’t confine themselves to stages. They set the stage for visualisations, theater and other cross-disciplinary collaborations. Amongst listeners were the audiences at Harry Klein Club, Melkweg and the Amsterdam Fashion Week.\r\n\r\n“I'm always looking for a sound that's both familiar and innovative,” Cardboard Motel reflects upon his music. “But harmony and melody are highly important to my sound.” One thing is for sure; this young producer creates with vision and is here to stay. His music doesn’t start by pressing play, but by creating an environment that suits the moment.",

At the time it wasn't appreciated, but it was a sign about what was going to happen in his life growing up as a teenager.\r\n\r\nWhen he was about 11 years old he bought his first ever record, Michael Jackson's \" BAD \" , still looked at as one of the best records ever made. Together with this record and others from Queen and some old Motown records, he started to create a wide interest in music.\r\n\r\nWhen he was about 15, he started to play at different parties of friends and family, just mixing music on a tape deck (!) and trying to get two records to play at the same time. If that didn't work, he would just try to make the best of it.. When he reached 18/19, he started to get in touch with people who were making music by spinning records! He learned this technique quickly and bought himself two turntables and practised and practised and practised...\r\n\r\nAfter being able to mix his music together with his crowd-controlling qualities, he started to produce his own music when he was about 23. He went to Paris with one of his buddies, Ruben de Ronde. There he played in several clubs, aswell as making tracks in the tiny studio they had together. When they came back in Holland, things really started to heat up, when Ruben became of the biggest upcoming talents in Trance/progressive music, and Jinx came to be one of the known dj's in the area. His productions with and without Ruben, have been played all over the world. Now with his name changed to his own, he's ready to rock as a artist known for his enthusiasm and improvisation!\r\n\r\nThe biggest dj's, like Sander van Doorn, Tiesto, Roger Sanchez support his tracks and with his appearances in Holland and parties abroad, Bram Troost has grown to be a Dj / Producer that is capable to provide music to be enjoyed to it's full potential...",

A true tease 'n squeeze, flowing over the crowd, outside boxes and without restraints. \r\nHe was taken in -from a sensitive age- by compositions of Bach and Verdi, until his long term acquaintance with the attitude of such artists as Dean Martin and Louie Prima, and a scrumptios relationship with strong hip-hop rhythms -of the likes of A Tribe Called Quest and The Neptunes- got him married to the sublime sounds of house & techno. \r\nThe bond that he felt exponentially strengthening around him and his feelings for electronic music broadened his perspective, yet specialized his mindset, and set him on stages of clubs such as Catwalk, WATT and BIRD. Beside being active as a respected DJ, member of the Triphouse collective, he is also co-founder of renouned quality driven organizations Boogie Friday and Tunnelvisie.\r\n\r\nWith a connected mind, a mighty heart and a soul of centuries, Damoon intends to continue reaching for better and more. \r\nFloat like a hi-hat, sting like a snare drum. Catch him blending audio like a rainstick in a hail storm.\r\n\r\nCheck out listn.to/Damoon for musical references and his show schedule. For booking info please contact damoon.music@gmail.com",

  "artist_bio": "DJ / Producer from Amsterdam.\r\nPerforming all over Europe, and releasing on labels like: Armada, The Sessions, Baroque, Vapour and Iboga.\r\n\r\nBookings: www.twopointzeroagency.com / murray@twopointzeroagency.com\r\nBorn in 1976 in a small town in the rural parts of Holland, multi talented Dutch artist C-Jay took up an early interest in electronic and experimental music of artists like Jean Michel Jarre, Vangelis and Tangerine Dream. Allready at the age of 11, C-Jay got his first muscial educations on the ins- and outs of both digital and analogue instruments, with the enthousiastic love and support of his parents and a local music teacher. His love for synthesizers grew and pretty soon young C-Jay’s bedroom was swamped with analogue synths and drum machines, paid for by his weekend jobs. And now years later at the age of 36, C-Jay is as diverse as it gets in today’s dance music business: former recordstore owner (Sessions Recordstore), dj, producer, label owner (The Sessions Recordings) promoter of his own underground nights called “Electric Cafe” and “Head of Dance music Licenses” at Dutch authors rights company “Buma / Stemra.” With his dayjob he makes sure composers and authors of Dance music in Holland get paid when their music is performed on stage.\r\n \r\nAs a producer C-Jay got his first worldwide release in the spring of 2004. This track (SwayWatch) got signed to the Moun10 imprint, (owned by Dutch house legend Jaydee) and got massive support from artists like The Flash Brothers, Chris Fortier and Fred Numf.\r\n His second release, co-produced by his longtime friend Jaydee under their “Graylock” alias, got a release on First Impression Recordings, the label of ……Jaydee. This release got supported, played and charted by Armin Van Buuren, Ton TB, Paul Van Dyk, The Flash Brothers, Carl Cox, Chris Fortier and many more.\r\n Due to the fact that both releases were received so well by the international scene, C-Jay decided to start his own recordlabel “The Sessions Recordings.” The label soon became a fact, and the first vinyl hit stores worldwide in november 2004. Some time later after 3 releases on his own label C-Jay had the result he wanted: the attention of both the scene as well as the people on dancefloors worldwide. The established labels were now interested in him as an artist, cause he made a name for himself and he had shown that his tunes were loved by many around the globe, selling easily around 3000 – 4000 copies back in the vinyl days, long before digital sales.\r\n \r\nA year later, in November 2005, C-Jay’s co-production with his friend Mick Wilson\r\n (UK / Tilt! / Parks & Wilson) appeared on the well respected Dutch imprint Cyber Records. This masterpiece called “Darkism” was a personal favorite of Anthony Pappa and Hernan Cattaneo who both have been dropping it a lot in their sets of summer / fall 2005. Hernan Cattaneo even closed his legendary Dance Valley Festival 2005 set with this floorfiller…. and Dutch national radio did a live broadcast of that set. \r\n\r\nIn February 2006 after a string of releases on well known labels, C-Jay decided to re-start his own label again and turn it into a digital imprint. Talented young guys like Roger Martinez, Josel & Pedro, Bastian Bouma and Patch Park all released their early tunes through The Sessions Recordings. And in September 2008 “Magnanimity” saw the light of day on his label. C-Jay’s first full length artist album on physical CD contained 2 discs, with remixes by other artists on the second disc. The album got superb reviews and in Holland the legendary OOR magazine was raving about it. OOR can be compared to Mixmag or DJ Mag. In August 2011 C-Jay released his second full lenght artist album on CD. Again, this release got superb reviews, high ranked charts and the track “Electric Cafe” (with Sezer Uysal) turned into a small top selling hit success in several countries. Even Armin van Buuren still plays it out in his 2012 sets. \r\n\r\nNext to his studio work, C-Jay used to be a well known recordstore owner and event promotor in Holland from 2000 untill 2006. As he was a skilled and eager dj without gigs, he decided to throw his own nights. With success! He organised some legendary events during those years, inviting artists like Moshic, Chris Fortier, James Holden, Chris Cowie, Anthony Pappa and Quivver to Holland. In 2006 the nights officially stopped, but he still runs his highly acclaimed “Electric Cafe” nights in Patronaat Venue, just outside Amsterdam. Every month from September to March, since 2010.\r\n \r\nHaving shared dj booths with almost every big star of the scene, C-Jay is bound to become one himself. In the last couple of years C-Jay found himself playing gigs in Poland, Romania, Holland, Germany, Greece, Belgium, Switzerland, Jordan and the Ukraine and the rest of the world is waiting for him.\r\n \r\nNot doing it for the Hall Of Fame but just loving what he does since childhood, C-Jay is known for his motto: “Progressive is an attitude….” (not a style)\r\n \r\nComments on C-Jay\r\n \r\nGreat guy, great producer, good friend.\r\n Jaydee\r\n \r\nWell done boy! I love your stuff.\r\n Hernan Cattaneo\r\n \r\nIt’s great to work on tracks together, C-Jay is such a down to earth guy. Great producer!\r\n Eelke Kleijn\r\n \r\nC-Jay’s the missing link between Psychedelic Trance and Progressive House. And above all a top geezer who’s passion and enthusiasm for Trance is inspiring.\r\n Zen Mechanics\r\n \r\nSince a few years now i find everything C-Jay makes is ending up in my sets.. Definetley ace productions.\r\n Anthony Pappa\r\n \r\nEpic and smooth music. I like alot the different storys in each track. Very deep and atmospheric moods.\r\n Cool and easy going guy, im glad to work with him.\r\n Motion Drive\r\n \r\nC-Jay delivers lovely hypnotic productions since years. Always have some tracks of him in my cd case.\r\n Liquid Soul\r\n \r\nI love his music, he just get better and better.\r\n And he has a twisted sense of humor on top of that. A true talent.\r\n Parham \r\n\r\nC-Jay is really good in making “druggy” and hypnotic music. Loving his stuff…\r\n Elusive (norway / espen & elusive)\r\n \r\nLoving C-Jay as much as ever..his production skills are ace.\r\n Shiloh \r\n\r\nC-Jay is not only a really nice person and my mate, but also a brilliant dj / producer in my opinion. He gets better with every release he makes. Definetely supporting him.\r\n Moshic\r\n \r\nFor me, one of the best talents from the Netherlands. You should defo watch out for his forthcoming releases!! Amazing stuff..\r\n DJ19 (19box recordings japan)\r\n \r\nGreat producer, i really love the music he makes. Dropping it a lot during my sets.\r\n Sandra Collins (perfecto / usa)\r\n \r\nC-Jay is besides our good friend, also a devoted producer who sticks with his own sound and style. Doing the stuff he does best, making damn good tunes!\r\n Yves Eaux\r\n \r\nI found C-Jay’s DJ-ing style to be remarkably smooth when i played with him in a club in Holland. His music choice is excellent. When I saw C-Jay play,\r\n I was very impressed and I’m not easily impressed! Smooth, Flawless, and utterly enjoyable.\r\n He’s definitely Premier league!\r\n Chris Cowie\r\n \r\nReally good Mixer. Good sound blends and nice long mixing. I played with him in Poland and Holland and really enjoyed his sets and music.\r\n Jonathan Lisle (Bedrock, UK)\r\n \r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Christopher Ivor is a composer, producer and live performer from Amsterdam's electronic underground.\r\nMusic has always been and always will be an important part of his life.As a toddler he was already making his own radio mixtapes but quickly discovered his father's record collection. He was instantly hooked and soon started spending his precious pocket money on vinyl. This led him naturally to getting his first turntables. Although enjoying spinning other peoples music Christopher soon found out that he was more interested in making his own tracks.\r\nEventually he set up an underground studio together with his brother and a friend. It was there where he found out his natural ability to write music and play live with his hardware and started performing on stage.\r\nSince then he has always continued composing, remixing and performing. His style has become very broad and eclectic. This has evolved today into a deep progressive techno sound with a lot of percussion, melody and core elements of House music.\r\nIn 2008 Christopher Ivor also teamed up with vocalist and performer Prudence Madison to form the electro-duo 'Nightowl Academy', an ongoing collaboration to this day.\r\nFurthermore he is also one half of the energetic live-act 'The Nine Lives' and co-founder of Stichting HENK, an organisation infamous for it's live Techno events in and around Amsterdam.\r\nExperience, dedication and a lot of passion has made his work unique in a world of often generic sounding dance music.",

  "artist_bio": "‘Excellent, excellent sounds of Colophon’ — Ben Sims on NTS Radio LondonIt was at a very young age when I was introduced to house music in the early '90ies with loads of dj mix cassette tapes. Years later I met David Vunk, founder of Moustache Records Rotterdam. Through his and my friends’ enthusiasm I started buying vinyl records and spinning at local parties, Waterfront Rotterdam and Bootleg DJ Cafe. After several years my interest moved towards creating beats and started off with Reason software. Visiting the impressive studio of David Vunk made me decide to go on with hardware and bought my first synth, the Roland AlphaJuno of New World Aquarium (of Delsin fame).\r\n\r\nNowadays music is created with old analogues and new techno​logies like Ableto​nLive, trying to catch the spirit that once started in Detroit.\r\n\r\nSeveral tracks were picked up e.g. broadcasted during \"The Interg​alactic FM Demo Contest\" and judged by a panel of producers including I-F, Legowelt, Rude66, Alden Tyrell, Syncom Data and others.\r\n\r\nTop favorited by Steve Rachmad during the SAE Audiobot competition reviewing it as 'intense techno in the vein of Berlin's Redshape and Amsterdam's Delsin record label’. Later on Steve recommended me as an upcoming talent in a very promising interview on DJ Scene.\r\n\r\nAnother track won the SAE Audiobot Competition with Darko Esser (Wolfskuil/Ovum) and was fine tuned at the profes​sional SAE Studios Amsterdam with help, tips and tricks by Darko and studio engineer MA Spaventi (RAG/C​rystal Maze/MOS Record​ings). Next to that a review of the studio session was published in DJ Broadcast magazine!\r\n\r\nThe official debut release was a remix made for Jeroen Liebregts aka Radial (Mord/​Drumco​de/Mot​e-Evol​ver) amongst other remixers such as Anton Pieete (100% Pure/R​ejecte​d), Darko Esser/​Tripeo (Wolfs​kuil/Clone) and Patrik Skoog (We Are/Dr​umcode​).\r\n\r\nFirst full artist release (digital + vinyl) on Estroe’s new label Rosedale Records with remixes by New York based Brendon Moelle​r/Echo​logist (Electric Deluxe, Echocord) and Rotterdam techno heroes Duplex (Clone).",

Influenced by local heroes like Dimitri from Amsterdam, and with an inbuilt love of music passed on from his church organist father, he put down his childhood flute to pick up some SL1210s and a mixer instead!“I’ve always loved house music.” He says, his first experience’s of dance music were at the school disco's were the DJ would occasionally play a house tune, it wasn’t until later when he was invited by a friend to visit a house party that he truly began to understand the power of house music, and he vowed to learn how to mix and take people on sonic journey of enlightenment.\r\n\r\nFast forward to now, and we find Jurriaan hosting his own night called \"Chorris invites..\" at the world famous ClubNL in Amsterdam, as well as gigs around the city. His influences now are in the form of Isreali superstar Guy J, techno supremo Marco Carola and local guy Oliver Weiter. His style covers many genres but mostly centres on the deeper end of tech house and techno.\r\n\r\nWhat's clear from even a few moments talking with this plucky Dutchman, is his unwavering love for the music and the scene. Living smack bang in the middle of a world clubbing Mecca hasn’t hurt his chances either, Amsterdam is a buzz of tourists, locals and day trippers, and that joyous, happy energy is very clearly transposed into his incendiary DJ sets.",

  "artist_bio": "Cinema Royale blends Bohannon-Funk, tough House and all sorts of Disco/Italo/Filmic music in an artfull way into a cohesive entity.Right from his first appearance in 1998 at the Rotterdam Film Festival to this very day, Arne Visser aka Cinema Royale always remained faithful to his passion for soundtracks. Whether you experience him in an exclusive atmospheric setting or during a high energy dance floor set, he never looses sight of his beloved audience. His powerful selection of quality music and his ability of gentle flowing between different genres create a cinematic universe where we are all captured by his innovative energetic sound, named Cinema Royale.\r\n\r\nThe actual DJing started after he was inspired by New York based DJ Mondo Lucien, who's amazing way of glueing all kinds of retro and innovative music was a total novelty, being one of the founding fathers of what later would be called Lounge. This trigger led to new perspectives and a focus on blending and mixing all kinds of filmic music, combined with the finest electronic music, both uptempo and downtempo.\r\n\r\nAfter a period of successful playing for the Rotterdam Film Festival, numerous Cinemas, the Dutch Film Festival and many Premieres and Award parties, Cinema Royale is invited in 2001 by the legendary DJ Eddy De Clercq to play at his infamous Testlab Party at the Paradiso, having heart him playing at his residency at Cinema Ketelhuis, called Cinema Du Disque.\r\n\r\nThis introduction would later appear to be his kick-off for the club scene, playing for Rocket Cinema, T-Dansent, Winkel van Sinkel and the early Ex-Pornstar parties amongst others. In 2002 he accompanies Eddy De Clercq at his Latin flavored club night called Lust at Club Panama. He also becomes resident at the acclaimed Maastricht club nights from the multi-talented DJ Don Londi. It is also the year that Cinema Royale starts working with Video Artist Sergio Ulhoa during a VJ Festival at the Nieuwe Vide in Haarlem. Their strong collaboration evolves itself in the current concept The Minx, the dialogue between filmic DJ'ing and choreographed Video Art, presented at hot spots such as Club Panama, Now and Wow in Rotterdam and the Amsterdam Concertgebouw.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 Cinema Royale is closely involved with Art Projects at the Nieuwe Vide and he is part of the artistic concept Z.O.Z. at the Zebra Lounge, together with MC Vika Kova. Other highlights are the film premiere for the movie Cloaka, bookings in Prague and the launch of the Superbrands concept together with Sergio Ulhoa. His unique residency at the Italian lunch room Renzo's assumes mythological proportions, attracting people from all over Amsterdam and abroad, including Detroit producers Carl Craig and Derrick May.\r\n\r\nIn 2004 Arne is asked to play at the Life Achieving Award for International director Paul Verhoeven at Paradiso. It is also the year where the Cinema Royale concept is firmly established in the B2B through Willemijn van Hussen, who builds up a strong artist portfolio which would later result in the exclusive Event Company Blue Luna, playing for Heineken, Jaguar, Maison Van den Boer, SupperClub, Bacardi/Martini, Shell, KLM and McKinsey amongst others.\r\n\r\nIn 2005 art and fashion events become more prominent, playing at Sotheby's for artist Petra Hart, the Cobra Museum, arranging fashion shows for Fashion House Pauw, Glerum Auctioneers and the Amsterdam Art Association De Kring. Cinema Royale also performs at the Maison Royale Festival, with the prestigious new jazz programming by the acclaimed DJ/producer and source of inspiration Monte La Rue. In September he travels with his Cinema Royale concept to Kiev, where he performs with MC Vika Kova and the Snow VJ's.\r\n\r\nIt is also the year where he starts his magic collaboration with trumpeter Saskia Laroo, playing together at De Doelen for the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, the Bollywood Festival and the Zandvoort Jazz Festival and at his residency in the Sugar Factory.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 Cinema Royale is invited by Jan Des Bouvrie to present The Minx concept at the launch of the SpringIsInTheAir collection at The Arsenaal. He plays at the Maison Royale Festival and for the Concertgebouw Orchestra at Cineac, and plays during the Stadsspelen auction in Club Elf. He furthermore plays during Terrazza Martini at the Amstel Hotel, producing a Terrazza Martini Theme including 4 fashions shows. He performs at the Maison Van den Boer 100 Year Jubilee at the Concertgebouw and opens Europe's biggest Videoscreen on the Rembrandtplein together with VJ legend Micha Klein.\r\n\r\nIt is also the year of the launch of the weekly Cinema Royale Radio Show at the national dance platform DJBroadcastFM. Cinema Royale is also asked to play at the American Songbook music show from national comedian Hans Teeuwen, accompanied by i.e. jazz players Benjamin Herman and Jesse van Ruller.\r\n\r\nOther gigs in 2006 include Paradiso's Rocket Cinema, Amsterdam Dance Event in Odeon for AMS Bookings, the Beurs van Berlage with violin player Rachel Grace, Sotheby's, the launch party of Dramatic Beat, the Jimmy Woo concept Shanghai Shady and a residency at Beach club Together.\r\n\r\nIn 2007 Cinema Royale extends his passion through a succesfull concept called 3SidesLive, the live communication between DJ, harp and violin. This innovative project is performed at mainstage Ahoy during the opening of the ABN AMRO Tennis Tournament, at the Festival Classique in The Hague, De Dag van de Nederlandse Jazz and the Must Club Night amongst others. It is also the year of the birth of The Minx, the pushing forward clubnight created with Video Artist Sergio Ulhoa. Other highlights are the collaboration with the Italian new-jazz Vocalist Stefania Dipierro, gigs for Dekmantel, Olympique, Cinema RIALTO and the Ghanasi Fashion Show and corperate gigs for Nokia, Bacardi and Theatre Tushinski.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 Cinema Royale acclaims new residencies at the beloved Vagebond Club Nights, the legendary SupperClub and Lab 111 in Smart Project Space. Other highlights are bookings for McKinsey, Smart, Ocean Diva Event 2008, Hunkemuller, the opening of the renewed Heineken Experience, bookings in Rome, playing in Ahoy, for the Nationale Ballet, Hilton Hotels and during the JFK Award in the Passenger Terminal.\r\nA new collaboration is born with talented singer and percussion player Gianna Tam, which is presented at club nights, Ahoy and for Maison van den Boer in Rotterdam amongst others. Cinema Royale also compiles with great success his first CD compilation for Mailmedia.\r\n\r\nThe field where famous and obscure soundtracks are mixed and blended with organic and abstract electronic music, the field where James Bond can drink his shaken Wodka Martini in Detroit and where Nino Rota can have his dialogue with Curtis Mayfield and the Yellow Magic Orchestra: Cinema Royale!\r\n\r\nLife is a Movie! Enjoy it to the Max!\r\n\r\nAmsterdam 2010",

A bit of an outsider, playing progressive and highly danceable sets, made him a highly effective secret weapon in the past few years.\r\n\r\nIt was in the beginning of 2012 when he started organising his forward thinking The Warehouse Party, an event that showcased his taste in music and brought in artists like Presk, Gerd and NT89. The closing edition with William Kouam Djoko was crowned with the words “perfection exists” by music blog Knalldrang. The party was co-hosted by his record label Little Globe Records, “a musical outlet for the talented and upcoming”, as the dj explains.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 2014, Cursed P started to host a Red Light Radio show, where he invites guest dj’s to do a back 2 back session with him. Artists like Nuno Dos Santos, Tom Ruijg, Jorn Liefdeshuis, Tsepo, Dimitri, JP Enfant and Applescal all participated and the show will continue in a two hour setting, monthly in 2015.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, Cursed P is in the studio working on a debut EP, as a follow up to his remix of Brad Coleman's 'The Getaway' and his remix of Dutch indie band The Benelux, which was launched by THUMP early 2014.",

Taking most of his inspiration from French artists such as The Hacker, Miss Kittin and Vitalic, Stefan started to make his own music using Fruityloops. \r\nIt wasn’t till later that Stefan had his first real Techno encounter at an underground event in an empty warehouse. His love for Techno music is born! At this point Stefan took a break from producing and took the time to listen to, and more importantly, enjoy his new found love for a style of music that has touched millions of us around the world. \r\nTwo years and a lot of Techno party’s later, it was time to start producing again....but this time concentrating on the style he loves most, Techno. \r\nUsing Ableton Live, Stefan has already produced a significant amount of music and at the age of 20 performed a live set for the first time together with his friends Revvel and Bit as the group Oersoep. \r\nStefan now produces and is founder of Raw Structure Records. \r\n- Contact & Booking \r\n- stefanschneider@live.nl",

The Dutchman has no preference for genre, but instead buries himself in a studio full of analogue gear then tweaks and edits, toys with and transposes sounds, textures and surfaces, until he is happy with the results, be they house, techno or whatever else.\r\n\r\nAs a vinyl spinning DJ he is just as hard to categorize, playing differently at all times of the day from early morning to sunny afternoon to darkened night times. All that he cares about is passing on his particular musical tastes, and does so with plenty of tension and suspense, always engaging the crowds he plays to at clubs in Amersfoort, Utrecht and Amsterdam. He’s spun many times at parties like Schmeck Pony, Into the Woods and is regularly seen at Studio 80.\r\n\r\nContinuous Space Time also performs intricate, floor owning live sets in nightclubs everywhere, weaving anything from breaks to acid into a tight and unique groove using a variation of kit that ranges form vintage and budget synthesizers to contemporary drum machines and new school Moogs. All this and yet still he is just starting out: expect much more in the months to come.",

Daniel’s ‘mumbling’ vocals give the track that special edge.\r\nWhen Dylan Hermelyn (2000 and One), head of the 100% Pure and Remote Area-labels heard ‘Mumbling yeah’ for the first time, he immediately signed Daniel for his brand new Area Remote label.\r\n\r\nAlthough ‘Mumbling yeah’ is Sanchez’ first record, he’s been around for quite some time and made his name as a dj, party organiser and as one of the key figures of the burgeoning Amsterdam minimal and techno scene. His successful Rotzooii and Blabla parties – held amongst others in Studio 80, Stubnitz, Bunker and Westerunie - are among the best underground-events Amsterdam has to offer.\r\n\r\nBut with ‘Mumbling yeah’ one of the best selling singles of 2007, Sanchez now focuses more time on his production and dj career.\r\n",

They are influenced by names such as, Henrik Schwarz, Art Department, Soul Clap, Tiger & Woods, and Solomun, but also by more oldskool stuff from the 90’s like Daft Punk and Bobby Brown.\r\n\r\nLex started playing in 2008 in Gainesville, Florida (USA), where he was studying for a year at the University of Florida. Every Thursday he played in a little club called Spank. This experience was so overwhelming that he knew this was something he wanted to do more often. His roommates in America got tired of him playing music all the time. He was influenced by 90’s Hip Hop, Techno and Disco tracks and you can still hear that in the sets.\r\n\r\nWietse was always the one at a party choosing the music to play and his love for deep house with and edgy disco sound was well appreciated. He only started playing when meeting Lex and that’s where it all begun.\r\n\r\nSince that moment they have been making Mixtapes and those were well received. Their first big gig was playing at ‘The Chicago Social Clubʼ, where they had the honor to open for Catz ‘N Dogz. After this they got booked in Groningen, Maastricht and Amsterdam,Lima (Peru) where they played with names such as, NOIR, Matt Fear, Martin Augustin, Gabriel Ananda, Miss Melera, SHMLSS, Darko Esser, Matt Tolfrey & Sam Russo.\r\n",

It’s what binds us all like sleep, breathing and eating. No suprise that his debutalbum is dedicated to that neverending quest for balance, or as the Dutch call it: ‘Balans’. Most tracks on the album have opposing titles and the atmosphere changes from dark, moody and emotional to uplifting, cheerfull and happy. Sometimes even within the same track.Music, work, friends and life in general is all about balance for Dutch DJ, producer and promoter Darko Esser. And more importantly finding and keeping that balance despite all the contradictions, rollercoasterrides and paradoxes life can put in front of you. It’s what binds us all like sleep, breathing and eating. No suprise that his debutalbum is dedicated to that neverending quest for balance, or as the Dutch call it: ‘Balans’. Most tracks on the album have opposing titles and the atmosphere changes from dark, moody and emotional to uplifting, cheerfull and happy. Sometimes even within the same track.\r\n\r\nFinding balance in contradictions is also the main reason why his activities cover such a wide range and can be completely different in character. From programming the electronic music-events for the legendary Dutch venue Doornroosje to DJ-ing all over Europe back to making music in the solitude of his homestudio and selecting tracks for new releases on his Wolfskuil imprint. The difference between these activities is not entirely contradictory, because it’s all about the music at the end of the day.\r\n\r\nAs a DJ he has more then 15 years of experience in the bag and has played all over Europe in world famous clubs such as Berghain & Panoramabar, Rex, Tresor, 11, House Of God and off course his homebase Doornroosje. His sound is versatile and strongly depends on the setting and atmosphere of that particular moment. One could say that his sound is strongly settles on the crossing borders between house & techno, but don’t be surprised if he takes a sideway into broken beat, dubstep, electronics or the undiscribable.\r\n\r\nWith a discography of over 30 releases, including international clubhits like ‘Paradox’ (Underwater), ‘Catatonic’ (Ovum) and ‘The Return’ on his own Wolfskuil imprint, Darko has established a solid reputation in the producer department ever since his first records came out in 2003. His releases receive massive support from international keyplayers as diverse as Laurent Garnier, Dave Clarke, Sasha, John Digweed, Steve Bug, Francois K, Luke Slater and Len Faki. Following this succes he was asked to remix tracks from Anthony Pappa, Sharam Jey, Davide Squillace and King Roc amongst others.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 he started the label Wolfskuil Records together with his good friend LL. Nowadays he runs the label by himself and activity has been increasing over the years thanks to overwhelming support from the industry and off course an increasing input of strong demos. The evergrowing Wolfskuil family ranges from young producers who release their first record to established musician like Joris Voorn, DJ Yellow, Benny Rodrigues and Paul Brtschitsch. He is very ambitious with the label, so watch out for more artistalbums in the following years.\r\n\r\nAs a promoter he is involved in more then a 100 events each year ranging from small clubshows as programdirector for electronic music in Doornroosje and Merleyn, to programming festivals up to 15.000 capacity, like Free Your Mind in Arnhem. Music- and genrewise there are no limitions, since quality manifests itself in many different shapes and sounds.\r\n\r\nMusic keeps the balance.",

  "artist_bio": "DANIEL WANROOY \r\nJUST A LEGEND !Background: Hailing from the flatlands of Dordrecht, Southern Holland, Daniel Wanrooy has been influencing the playlists of some of the world’s top DJs for over 6 years. Both as one half of highly-lauded duos Progression & Odyssee and as a standalone artist, his evocative, imaginative music has successfully cross-bred virtually every sub-genre of trance.\r\n\r\nBeginnings: EDM life for Daniel started in the early 90’s when he began messing around with electronic instruments. Experimenting with the first Tracker programs, he learned to make music by the well-traversed method of trial and error! Age 24 he signed his debut single ‘Roda Summers’ to Ton ‘Three Drives’ T.B.’s well-respected Massive Drive label. Launching his production career in earnest, it garnered plays from Armin, Rank 1 & Misja Helsloot among many others.\r\n\r\nProgression & Odyssee PT 1: 2004 though proved to be Daniel’s big, graduating year as he banded together with fellow friend & producer Robin van de Wiel… Pooling resources as well as knowledge they released several tracks before launching a second act under the name Progression. Touting around various Dutch labels, they were snapped up by Fundamental Recordings. The 12” ‘Purify’ & ‘Ocean Green’ (2004) were quickly followed by ‘Indeep Sounds’ & ‘Sands of Time’ in 2005.\r\n\r\nProgression & Odyssee PT 2: It was around this time that Daniel flew unmistakably onto the radar of über trance talent-spotter Tiësto. Over the last three years, the luminary’s has used an unprecedented 4 tracks of Daniel’s work on his mega-selling ‘In Search of Sunrise’ series. In 2005 Odyssee moved over to Black Hole with the pair licensing the double-header ‘Frontline’ & ‘Evolution’. In tandem, they also moved Progression over its sub-label I.T.W.T. (In Trance We Trust) with ‘Superstitious’ and subsequently onto Magik Muzik for ‘Technophobia’ & ‘Loving Memories’ in 06.\r\n\r\nProgression – The Album: Staying true to the act’s name (and completing the circuit of Tiësto’s labels) Progression unleashed their debut long-player ‘Different Day, Different Light’ in 07 on Black Hole. Marked up by MTV as “two hours of fascinating music”, it received a huge reception from press and DJs alike.\r\n\r\nDaniel Wanrooy - the DJ: A wish to see his tracks working from the perspective of the DJ booth along with a desire to travel the globe prompted Daniel to take the DJing plunge in 2003. DJ dates have given him an invaluable POV, increasing his knowledge of how to make his music even more floor-effective. He cut his teeth at an I.T.W.T. party at Backstreet in Eindhoven and has subsequently warmed up for Tiësto, spun at the legendary Heineken Hall in Amsterdam & played to 15,000 strong crowds across Europe. He now DJ’s regularly in the UK, as well as dates right across the world.\r\n",

It's all about the passion for music and the right track at the right time. Wherever they are they will adapt to the public and will raise the energy level up. The Culture Barbarians are  bringing the ultimate interaction, as part of their shows they are partying themselves, together with their crowd.\r\n\r\nBesides spinning other artists productions, the gentlemen themselves are producing some new beats. For example, recently  the produces a well received remix of the track \"Average Boy 'from pop band  Early Adopters. The Barbarinas have been busy with the production & release of their debut album, which appeared on January 31, 2013\r\n\r\nThe Culture Barbarians played at  local festivals such as Bijenpop, Jera On Air and Zomaarpop. This brought them to cool venues in cities like Amsterdam, Eindhoven, Tilburg and Utrecht. At the festivals Defqon1 and Mysteryland they played at the Schoolplein! area and at the Defqon1 Gold Stage. Last year they assisted Giel Beelen on 3FM during the Freaknacht by playing a 3 hour set. What The Culture Barbarians concerns there will be more parties to come!\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Daniel has been a staple in the Amsterdam club scene since 2009. His unique sound and organic mixes have earned him a name in the alternative electronic music scene, as his sets have been attributed to being melancholic, dynamic but above all, deeply melodic.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, the artist earned a nomination for “Best Producer” at Vinylized, the biggest Dutch competition for producers in the scene. Daniel has continued producing and played live at national and international clubs and festivals such as: Kater Holzig (Berlin), Studio 80 (Amsterdam), Paradiso (Amsterdam), Perron (Rotterdam), Tivoli (Utrecht), Pleinvrees (Amsterdam), Shoeless (Amsterdam), Thuishaven (Amsterdam) and Next Mondays Hangover (Amsterdam).In the summer of 2013, the producer released the “Tesla EP” with the hit “Never Gonna Break” on Berlin’s renowned label: Katermukke. Further labels on which he has released his work are: Manual Music, Cinematique and on his own label, Zauer Records of which he is owner and founder.\r\n\r\nHaunted by the drums and his experience as a drummer in several bands, Daniel has developed an exceptional rhythm and sound that no label will do justice. Terms such as deep techno or house don’t cover enough ground. The producer composes sets that exist in their own singularity; every single one being an individual story that creates its own atmosphere. Every set is textured by a whole variety of original tracks that he adapts with precise care and proper timing live on stage: dialogues, natural sounds and warm beats, all treated into a highly dynamic and unique set. Consequently, no live set will ever be identical.\r\n\r\nDaniel has been working together with other musicians such as singer/songwriter Florian Wolff. Likewise, he is also part of an electronic jam with live musicians and electronic producers. The interaction between his organic electronic sounds and other musical instruments ¬– with elements of jazz, pop and rock – create a unique and strikingly complete entity. The dialogue between every piece and instrument is exciting in the ear of the beholder. In this sense, Daniel is an extraordinary creative, always striving for progressiveness in his work.",

Gaining notoriety as co-founder and resident of the infamous GZG raves, he is now one of Holland’s most wanted technojocks. Representing the underground with a stern smile towards the mainstream, he’s winning over crowds across the Netherlands and beyond. A matter of timing or just a captivating choice of records? Who’s to say. Somehow The Man never fails to supply magical moments.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy behind the GZG parties isn’t genre-based, but aimed foremost at capturing the ‘New House Feeling’. A whole new generation of underground clubbers has been inspired by these raves in old warehouses, on boats and in deserted factories. While crowds grew steadily over the last six years, so did the fanbase of promoter and dj The Man With No Shadow. As his organization was defying the authority’s regulations, he was breaking the rules of clubland from behind the decks. The Man has nourished an extraordinary blend of silk-mixed techno: patiently luring you into his aggressive grooves, he always finds the perfect moment to make the dancefloor explode with a surprising record.\r\n\r\nHis talents haven’t gone unnoticed. The Man has brought his musical passions to some of Holland’s most renowned clubs and festivals – highlights including main stage Mystery Land, Awakenings, Studio 80 and Trouw. Meanwhile GZG has gone legit, hosting area’s at major events like The Love Parade, and organizing it’s own festival in Amsterdam. The Man With No Shadow has become a household name for quality dance music, setting aflame the raunchiest of raveholes to some of the world’s leading events.\r\n\r\nMost recently, The Man’s focus has become more international – especially since he became an intercontinental resident for Sensation Deluxe (2008 – 2011). Headlining the second floor of the world’s largest travelling indoor event and touring thirteen country’s – including Portugal, Denmark, Russia and Spain – has not only strengthened his determination to conquer all corners of the Earth. It also proves that a great deejay isn’t defined by his productions, but by his ability to rock any given dance floor.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor bookings go to: www.meanwhile.nl",

A multifaceted DJ, producer, live act and visual designer, Dansor is also the brains behind the burgeoning Comport Records, an independent label that’s making quite the name for itself in underground circles.\r\n\r\nDansor’s story started back in Budapest in the 1990s, a time when her native country was just free from communist rule. It was a period of dramatic cultural change, with Dansor soon becoming enthralled by foreign synth-pop acts a la Duran Duran and Depeche Mode. The visit of Kraftwerk to the city in 1991 epitomised the social shift, while a sprightly Dansor – at merely thirteen years old – left the historic concert captivated by a sound that would come to define her later life.\r\n\r\nWith Hungary’s ‘underground’ gathering pace years later, Dansor threw herself into the scene, with electronic acts such as Art Of Noise, Leftfield, Front 242 and clubs such as “Feketelyuk” (Black Hole) and “Zöldség-Gyümölcs” (Fruits and Vegetables) all playing a formative role in the honing of her musical inclinations. With Budapest undergoing this cultural renaissance of sorts, acid house parties soon began to spring up across the city (and goa-trance parties around the whole country), both of which proved another rich source of inspiration for the music hungry teenager. But with the country’s economic situation still bleak, she made her way to the Netherlands in search of a new lease of life.\r\n\r\nIt’s a move that’s paid off handsomely too, and Dansor acquired her first set of decks on Queen’s Day, 1997, for the pricey sum of 1 Guilder. She mastered the art of mixing while Dutch producer Georgio Schultz was pushing her talents in the right direction by installing Cubase on her first - Atari - computer.\r\n\r\nDansor set up her own ‘WomenWaves’ parties in her adopted town of Haarlem soon after, as well as the ‘Budapest Delight’ nights in Amsterdam that she still runs alongside Szilvia Harsz. And having grasped a taste of the DJing experience, she soon found herself yearning for more…\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that the Dansor project was born during the final semester of her Media Technology studies in the ‘00s. A live act that could be controlled without the need to stand behind a laptop, it didn’t immediately set pulses racing - with even the lady herself admitting that it was way ahead of its time. What it did prove beyond any doubt, however, is that Dansor is a producer not intent on taking the traditional route.\r\n\r\nSuch avant-garde approaches course throughout her productions too. Unsurprisingly, then, they’ve been picked up by a host of seminal worldly imprints: a collaboration with Medway by ‘Sensei’ and the Canadian ‘Whose Haus’, and her first solo releases by Little Mountain/THIS IS, Nervous and Tulipa.\r\nHer own Comport imprint (the label she helms alongside Soundbalance and Von Smir) has also played host to her intricate sound, a sound that’s incorporated everything from house to techno to dub, jazz/funk, italo disco, new wave and indie over the years - and one that’s found favour with luminaries of the scene such as Nick Warren, Kolombo, Sander Kleinenberg and Hernan Catteneo amongst others.\r\n\r\nWith her live set gathering an extra dimension thanks to collaborations with the likes of jazz trumpeter Saskia Laroo, and Comport following a similar trajectory, these are heady times indeed for one of Holland’s most striking electronic music musicians.\r\n‘My aim’ says Dansor, ‘is to combine and apply techniques used in the experimental music/art scene with danceable music.’ It’s an aim that she’s become increasingly adept at too, and hers is a story that’s littered with accolades. Did you know, for instance, that she was a former winner of Pete Tong’s Bedroom Bedlam and Dave Clarke’s ADE Demolition panel? Or that she was a finalist in the Dutch TWSTd DJ contest and a guest at the First International Conference for Digital Art in London? Not to mention all the previously mentioned achievements. Dansor, then, is a musician of undoubted repute. The good news is that she’s got plenty more in the tank yet…",

After a period of extensive jamming and practicing his guitar skills on their classic tunes a musical friend introduced him to a new kind of music. Still not techno though…\r\n\r\nIt was jazz! This led to many happy discoveries from this interesting musical realm and even almost turned out in a life dedicated to become a jazz guitarist. \r\nAs you can see, electronic music just wasn’t much on his mind during his early teens; except maybe maybe for the epic remix ‘Sky Was Pink’ by James Holden (known for also attracting rockers), which he just couldn’t resist because of his firm love for psychedelics. Despite that sweet record, he was disappointed at first when he looked up more electronic music. This was because of the seemingly (!) simple and repetitive character so characteristic for electronic music.\r\nOff course, this repetitiveness is also electronic music’s power, but sitting behind his computer with poor speakers and without a nice clubby environment the music just wasn’t able to find its way through yet (besides who knows, he may just have stumbled upon some corny trance crap). \r\n\r\nHow a surprise this all changed during his study in Amsterdam where he could witness the true power of electronic music in action. Electronic music after all is a body thing, and to see electronic music without people dancing would be like a fire without wood to make it burn. Discovering artists like Kollektiv Turmstrasse, Trentemøller, Max Cooper and Arjuna Schiks made him realise that good electronic music has massive feel to it, and sort of is the rock ‘n roll of our present. And he’d better be part of this and fast! An unstoppable urge to produce music surfaced and within days an interest evolved into an addiction. With quite a bit of the musical spectrum discovered (although never enough!) Zwaan now seeks to produce music that has feeling, will make you dance, but most important, will take his listeners to a world where only his mind will define any boundaries!\r\n\r\nLike him on facebook!\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Zwaan-LIVE/122503451201951",

Pumping with all the excitement, energy and enthusiasm of even the biggest and baddest weekender.\r\n\r\nFurther he performed among other things at Lief Festival (Utrecht), Edit Festival (Haarlem), Geheime Liefde (Utrecht), Studio 80 (Amsterdam), Westerunie (Amsterdam), Club Poema (Utrecht).Dauphin Åka is an electronic music addict from the moment he heard Acid and Techno at the rave parties of the early 90’s. With DJ’s like Dano, Buzz Fuzz, The Prophet, Gizmo, Petrov. A few years and many raves later a friend took him to Dimitri’s Hi-Tech Soul Movement, in the legendary RoXY Amsterdam. After that memorable night his taste of music changed to Detroit Techno with artists like Laurent Garnier, Kevin Saunderson, Carl Craig, Derrick May, Kenny Larkin, Josh Wink, Juan Atkins, Isis (a.k.a. 100% Isis), Eric Nouhan.\r\n\r\nIn 2004 Dauphin Åka could no longer withstand the turntables. He began collecting records and started to play vinyl. His first gig followed soon at DJ Café TWSTd Amsterdam. Having experienced the thrill of playing for a small audience, he wanted more. During the following years he developed as a DJ and slowly but steady he found the sound he likes best…underground Techno.\r\n\r\nHe is one of the resident DJ’s of \" What Is On Your Mind !? \", Amsterdam's legendary Techno Tuesday at Sugarfactory.

Building his sets in layers, containing raw grooves, warm baselines, spheric percussion and heavy kicks. Since April 2013 he started to perform with a four decks set up, which makes it possible for him to unfold the musical journey in endless ways.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years Dauphin Åka got interested in producing Techno. This new direction has influenced him as a performing artist as well and it resulted in a more solid and own sound. This year his first tracks will be available.",

  "cover_photo": "",
  "artist_bio": "Detroit Swindle was formed in 2011 by Lars Dales (1981) and Maarten Smeets (1982). It all started after Lars - who was programming a few nightclubs in Amsterdam - had to fire Maarten for playing too much underground music. They started talking and found out they had a mutual love for Motown, hip-hop and early house music. Not long after, they started making music together and the rest as they say, is history.When trying to define their ‘success’, it’s hard to pin it down to just one thing. Perhaps it’s their talent to find that typical groove that has been so widely acclaimed. Or maybe it’s their ability to connect musical styles spanning over more than 5 decades (and continents) into their sets and productions in such a way that you’re always curious to hear what comes next. Or could it be because they’re always on the move, searching for that new thing to challenge themselves in their productions and live sets. Whatever it is, it’s keeping them rather busy. \r\n \r\nNot surprisingly, staying busy is exactly what they’re doing with their label, Heist Recordings. Maarten and Lars are constantly on the look out for new music and that one promising artist that they feel needs to be heard. Though Heist saw it’s very first EP only back in 2013, it already has become the go-to label for many A-list dj’s. It has released a wide variety of exciting EP’s by a.o. Fouk, Max Graef, Brame & Hamo, M.ono, Frits Wentink, M.ono, Andy Hart and of course Detroit Swindle themselves. They’re working hard to give Heist that unique edge with the artists they work with, the artwork they put forward and the special projects they have on the label such as the yearly Roundup EP, a tradition where every artist of that year remixes another artist, effectuated by the luck of the draw. \r\n \r\nApart from Heist Recordings, Detroit Swindle have released music on renowned labels like Freerange, Future Classics, Dirt Crew (where they released their well received debut album ‘Boxed Out’), Tsuba, Classic Music Company, Kaoz Theory and many more. This includes notable remixes for Hercules and Love Affair, Chet Faker, Seven Davis Jr. and Romanthony’s track ‘Too Long’ produced by Daft Punk. \r\n \r\nThe boys are as much enthusiastic record diggers and synth hunters as they are lovers of modern day electronic music. With their position as curators of the Amsterdam house playlist for 22tracks they share their love for house music. This also goes for their own club night: ‘The Great Escape’, where they get to invite some of their favourite artists as well as young talent. The concept of ‘The Great Escape’ started out at Amsterdam’s Studio 80, but soon after made it’s way all over Europe with showcases in Paris, Leeds and London. \r\n \r\nDetroit Swindle have also been playing live shows right from the start, and have expanded their setup ever since. Currently, they’re touring with an extensive setup of analog and digital instruments and they’re bringing everything from key players to ground breaking live visuals with their show “Detroit Swindle & The Programme”, which will be showcased for the first time during ADE 2015.",

As being Dirty Dutch’s legendary figurehead, and because all editions would always fully sold out, Chuckie still successfully presents his own Dirty Dutch area at the Dutch festival Mysteryland.

Though that night saw him adapt ably to the situation, normal headline gigs for Delta Funktionen are about showcasing a wide variety of electronic sounds, with each one designed for maximum dance floor demolition.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the man’s productions, there has been a recent shift away from the conceptual offerings of his Electromagnetic Radiation releases and the stern techno seriousness of underground hits like his Silhouette EP and Setup Series on Delsin and Ann Aimee respectively. The results can best be heard on his debut Delsin album, Traces, which covers a lot of ground - and not all of it completely focussed on the dancefloor. With one eye on the past and two feet firmly stamping forward, it touches on everything from house to acid to techno to electro. In other words, it contains traces of everything that has gotten him to where he is today…",

  "cover_photo": "",
  "artist_bio": "Dimi Angélis / Short Bio: \r\n\r\nIt might sound like a cliché, but sticking to what you believe in really does pay off in the end. Dimi has been actively involved in the Dutch technoscene since the late nineties, his legendary raves at various locations still speaking to the imagination of many. Technofreaks abroad must know Dimi from his Counterpart and A&S project (w/ Jeroen Search). For their sound they draw inspiration from the classical Detroit minimalists and give it their own contemporary twist. As for Dimi’s dj-sets, he can venture into the deepest of house or the bloodiest of nosebleed techno, but he always stays true to himself and to the music in its purest form.When considering his status as beloved and respected member of the contemporary Amsterdam techno scene, it’s sometimes easy to forget Dimi Angélis was among the founding members of the very culture that helped shape it. Promoting illegal raves and warehouse parties and putting his first needle on a record back when “underground” was still a definable term, Dimi now holds well over a decade of international DJ-ing experience. It shouldn’t come as a surprise then that this is directly reflected by his record collection, musical knowledge and technical ability which all easily match and in most cases surpass that of many.\r\nSuch an extensive frame of reference enables Dimi to look at “techno” through a unique and highly personal lens. Well aware of the genre’s fluid boundaries, ever changing trends and the impact of continually developing technology, Dimi is able to elegantly step outside of the pre-determined\r\nfabric and in a sense mould its essential elements into something that feels familiar but upon more careful observation, or rather listening, is actually quite special.\r\n\r\nPutting personality and outspoken taste first, his DJ-sets are always\r\nremarkable and at no point predictable, more so because he does not believe in easy pleasing. Strongly opinionated and unafraid to speak on his thoughts, the records and flow incorporated in a Dimi Angélis set are equally straightforward and honest. What you see is in Dimi’s case really\r\nwhat you get, but it always comes wrapped in something appropriately unexpected.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 he joined forces with good friend Jeroen Search and together they have since launched multiple successful projects including outstanding live-acts “Counterpart” and “A&S Live” as well as\r\ntheir own newly founded vinyl only imprint, “A&S”. Under the first\r\nmentioned guise of Counterpart they are responsible for lauded EP’s such as “Ion” 01 and 02 on the sub-label of Rachmad’s Scorp of the same name, “Oxygenating” and “The Next Level” on Audiosculpture and “The\r\nMartian Mystique” on Jeff Mills’s Mission (6277/Axis).

  "artist_bio": "..Dennis Pors is a young and talented producer/dj from the Netherlands. In a country renowned for its contribution to the electronic music scene worldwide, Dennis was introduced to this type of music at the age of 16.\r\n\r\nListening to various sounds, his love for melodic Deephouse and Techhouse (which he refers to as: \"Music with a lot of feeling\") began to grow. As he tried to mix his favorite sounds behind the decks, he found out that he had a talent for DJ-ing. This led to his first gig in 2009 at Catwalk Rotterdam with Paul Hazendonk and Taras van der Voorde.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 21, after a couple of years of listening to, mixing and enjoying his type music, he was curious if he could transfer the musical thoughts and feelings he had in his head to actual tracks. So he bought a Macbook and began trying to produce. Only to find out that (without having ever learned to play any instrument) his talent for selecting and mixing records was equaled by his ability to create his own sounds.\r\n\r\nHis inspiration not only comes from listening to great producers such as Lawrence, Jimpster, Martinez or Agnes but also from reading books written by philosophers like Noam Chomsky and Eckhart Tollen. \r\nThis motivates Dennis to spread a message of positivity through his own music.\r\n\r\nAfter 2 years of progressing in music production with logic pro, he is proud to have his first tracks on Gooseneck Records (LA) with artist as Alex Deep, Robby N, Will Vickers,Soulmelt and more.\r\n\r\nHad also great support from: \r\nCity Soul Project and Scott Harrington who has charted a track, Danny Tenaglia,Luciano, Markus Schulz, Toni Rios, Tim Baker, Misjah, Franco Bianco, Noah Pred, Daniel Sanchez, Gare Mat K, DJ Sossa, Israel Vich, Lostra, Sakro, Tsugi Magazine, Billboard Magazine, MusicSenses Blog, Clubflavour,Blueraccoon FM, Afterhours Radio Show 99.1 FM,Deepvibes Radio, Volcano Radio, DI Radio, Subdivisions Global Radio, Diversions Radio Toronto, Radio 3Fach, Tunnel FM.\r\n\r\nHis second release on Eleflight Records expected in the end of January 2012, the label have great artists such as Andreas Saag,Chris Minus,Frej Le Vin, Jesus Pablo, Roberto Palmero,Santi Touch, Thomas Stiller and many more.\r\n\r\nExpect another release in the near Future on Toes in the Sand Recordings for the much more progressive music.\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Dimitri Kneppers music career reads like an encyclopedia. A house encyclopedia. After 23 years of spinning records you could call this DJ a true veteran.Nobody ever felt and looked so comfortable behind the decks as DJ Dimitri, for he brings the crowd at ease like Don Juan would do with women. When ecstasy is no longer just a word, but a true magical moment as the crowd, the surroundings and the music all come together in one hypnotizing state of happiness. This man knows -or should we say feels- what he is doing, not only behind the decks but also when producing. \r\n\r\nIn 1988 Dimitri obtains his first residency at club Richter in Amsterdam and starts spinning in the legendary RoXY, where he distinguishes himself from the rest through his bold and innovative mixing techniques. He is one of the first DJs to mix a house record with breakbeats or drum 'n bass, proving he is not only capable of mixing those two records together by tempo and rhythm effortlessly, but also just by melody or tune/pitch creating real-time compositions. At that time this was very exciting and groundbreaking, a style that has been copied ever so often, although never truly coming close to the master himself.\r\nBy 1991 Dimitri spins at all the major (warehouse) parties in the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy. He brings out his first record and starts his own label BE.S.T. (Beautiful Soul Techno). The first release on this label was called ‘Alice D in Wonderland’.\r\nFrom 1992 onwards he continues to take over the club world with gigs from Brussels to NYC and from Paris to Detroit, and starts his famous \"Hi-tech Soul Movement\" club night in RoXY on Thursday nights. People from all over the country come to check out his distinctive taste of records and to hear his 'no concessions policy' when choosing music- in which many consider him truly groundbreaking.\r\nIn the meantime he also starts a new record-label and store, with Eric Nouhan, called Outland Records on which three very successful compilations are released: Static Tracks, that has become a collectors item, and Spiritual Tracks l and ll. He makes instant fame with his record 'Don't be a prisoner of your own style'. Dimitri keeps adding more and more countries to his list and with his soulful house sound he is able to impress the likes of international stars as Derrick May & Carl Craig.\r\nBy 1995 he is voted best club DJ in the Netherlands. The first edition of Chemistry, one of the most successful parties in Amsterdam is being held in the Escape in 1995 where Dimitri is involved as a resident. He also becomes a resident in the U.K. Renaissance Club. In 1996 he is listed number 4 in Muzik Magazine’s International DJ of the Year Competition and in 1998, for four years in a row, he wins the prize of the best DJ in the Netherlands.\r\nIn 1999 Dimitri performs a self-composed music play together with Hubert Jan Hubeek, the Symphonic Orchestra and video performances of VJ 00Kaap, during Heineken Night Live in Ahoy Rotterdam. And in 2000 he starts a new project with computer artist and VJ Danielle Kwaaitaal called HI&LO. As a duo they exhibit in Art Factory, Tokyo and perform during the Golden Horse Film festival in Taipei. The show is seen in many different galleries throughout Europe and -for example- in Torch Gallery Amsterdam. \r\nIn 2004 Dimitri travels to the United States to play at the Detroit Movement Festival, the biggest free open-air techno festival in the world where he performs on the main stage.\r\nBy 2006 he collaborates in a project called ‘Matthäus Passion the remix’ were a few of the country’s best DJs and VJs work together to make an electronic version of Bach’s musical piece. Besides all these gigs and collaborations many Dutch radio stations like Radio 3, Fresh FM and Slam FM ask Dimitri for advice and interviews. \r\nAfter 23 years of playing, in the summer of 2007, he spins his official last record at a big festival called 10 years Meubel Stukken, and ends his DJ career. He starts working as a volunteer with mentally disabled children at a farm. In the mean time he still keeps up to date with the latest releases.\r\nHalfway 2009 Dimitri Kneppers installs his studio at home. \r\nAt june 16th 2010 the legend is back!\r\n\r\nMoving forward in this process Dimitri started his ‘ Allnighter’ residency at club Trouw, played at prior festivals in the Netherlands this summer: Awakenings, Loveland, Mysteryland just to name a few. In November this year he will be releasing his first EP on Planet E with remixes of Carl Craig and Orlando Voorn. More is yet to come so stay tuned.",

  "artist_bio": "The name Misjah has been synonymous with quality dance floor productions for over 18 years. An innovator, an inspiration and living legend to many.It all began in 1991 with releases under one of his alias's \"Dyewitness\". “Observing the earth”, “What would you like to hear”, “The Future” and “The Masterplan” already put his name on the map of dance floor hits forever. They are still considered all time classics. \r\n\r\nAfter these releases, Midtown Records asked Misjah to start his own label for them; X-Trax was born on December 1994. He started producing tracks with the help of some friends: DJ Tim and Jeroen (Groovehead) Artists such as Ferry Corsten, Umek, and Piet Bervoets (Rank1) also had releases on X-Trax Classics from this label include: Trippin' Out, The Club, Special Acid Edition, and of course “Access” which made it to the English charts in 1995. \r\n\r\nDue to the huge success of X-Trax he was sought after by such artists like: Josh Wink, Jam and Spoon, Reflect, Format One, Finitribe, Denki Groove, etc to produce remixes for them. \r\n\r\nMisjah has also produced under various artist/project names in different styles of dance music. In 1999 he started another project under the name “AMbassador”. It was under this name that he remixed “Blaze - My Beat”. His remix became a huge club hit and was used in the video clip. It also made it to the English charts. \r\n\r\nIn December 1999 he stopped doing the A&R for X-Trax. In 2001 he started a new label called ReRun and ReRun Booking's DJ Agency. The agency is responsible for booking some major players in the techno scene such as Hardcell, Trevor Rockcliffe, etc. \r\n\r\nHe has released on numerous labels including: Craft Music, Automat, Wetmusik, Pocket, Zync, Mankind, Jericho, etc. Just to name a few. His tracks are being played by many high profile djs as: Adam Beyer, Sven Vath, Carl Cox , Judge Jules, etc. \r\n\r\nSince his dj career took off in 1994, he has been traveling around the globe continuously to all continents. Playing at famous clubs and festivals including: Dance Valley, Roskilde, Mayday, Nature One, etc \r\n\r\nAs a DJ, Misjah has his own funky style. His sets contain bits and pieces of almost all styles of dance music from house to techno and from minimal to electro and everything in between. \r\n\r\nIn 2008 he started his monthly podcast \"Misjah In The Mix\" which is rapidly getting huge amount of radio play and downloads. He also recently switched from vinyl and cds to djing with Traktor DJ (vinyl and cd controlled of course). \r\n\r\nwww.djmisjah.com www.myspace.com/djmisjah",

Offcourse Dennis was more interested in the electronic side of music and listened to Jarre, Vangelis, Yello and other electro pop.\r\nWhen house music came to the Netherlands he found his holy grail. Visiting a lot of parties he got caught with the dj virus and he wanted to be in control over the dance floor.\r\nSo back in 1995 he bought a dj set and builded his first home studio which started out with a PC and some hardware. In the meantime his hobby became his living and his studio grew. Shifting from the digital domain to the analogue side he now has an impressive list of mostly analogue gear. Besides that he got really interested in the technical workings of synthesizers, drumcomputers an FX´s and started his bussiness Matana Teknik for this solo purpose.

This sound got him to play next to artists such as Kollectiv Turmstrasse, Ida Engberg, Nôze, Patlac or Kerstin Eden in Germany and the Netherlands. \r\nStarting with turntables, Dennis changed to a digital setup so it is not unusual that he plays 4 tracks at the same time and adds more sounds with his Maschine (Drum Machine). \r\n\r\nIn 2009 Dennis founded the successful techno event series Influenza* in the north of the Netherlands, which lead to an own music label - Influenza* music. On Influenza* music Dennis releases his productions, that have clear and present bass lines and outstanding warm melodies. His creative inspiration derives from artists such as N'to, Matador, 10dens or Pierre Deutschmann.",

  "artist_bio": "DJ Madskillz, a native of Amsterdam, is in great demand as both a DJ and producer. His CV already boasts more than 90 productions, which makes him one of the most prolific DJ’s in the Netherlands. His house and tech house sound always brings a unique, energetic twist to his popular DJ sets. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Madskillz can be found behind his turntables every weekend in clubs throughout the country, he takes producing just as seriously as DJ’ing. Because of his unique sound, DJ Madskillz is a much sought-after producer/re-mixer. In the last 20 years DJ Madskillz aka Gertjan Schonewille has worked with many leading House & techno labels such as, Plus 8 Records (Richie Hawtin), legendary Djax-up Beats (Miss Djax), Stealth (Roger Sanchez), 100% PURE (2000 and One), Area Remote and Bitten. Together with 2000 and One, Madskillz was part of classic Acid House \"Edge of Motion\" in the early 90's.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 he formed a producing partnership with Gregor Salto (G-REX Music) and their first successful collaboration was ‘Embryo’(DJ Madskillz & Gregor Salto, 2006). The hit was played by all the top DJs throughout the world. In the last years he also remixed tracks from international artists such as Axwell, Shinedoe, Christian Smith, Alex Celler, Roger Sanchez, 2000 and One, Sandy Rivera, Microfunk, David Penn, Till West, Eddie Thoneick and Bob Sinclar. These productions have seen them join the ranks of the top DJs. \r\n\r\nCurrently, Madskillz is in favour with his releases on the highly rated tech-house label 100% PURE, Area Remote & Bitten. His latest releases (Kliniek, Surface, Airmiles remix) are banged and played by Adam Beyer, Luciano, Paco Osuna, Tiefschwarz, Marco Carola, Karotte, Shinedoe, 2000 and One, Kabale und Liebe, Bart Skils and Anton Pieete.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\nDJ Madskillz, aka Gertjan Schonewille (1969), developed his enthusiasm for music when he first encountered the upcoming hiphop and electro sound in 1985. “I can remember that I was particularly fascinated by the music which was played on the well-known pirate stations in those days; music that was completely different from the top-40 tunes of that time.” He discovered house music and he got mad about this new sound after visiting club RoXY in Amsterdam in 1989. “I wasn’t really enthralled by just spinning records; I was particularly interested in new techniques to make music.” Gert bought a drum machine(Roland TR-909) and a bass synthesizer(Roland TB-303) and started to experiment in the studio. And how! In 1991, he produced, together with Dylan Hermelijn, ‘Edge of Motion’, his first 12\" ‘Set Up 707’, which became the ultimate worldwide house classic. From that moment on, he has been producing different styles, from trip-hop to drum & bass, from techno to house, under different aliases.\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Music child:\r\nIn 1970, this music child was born in the city of Paramaribo, the capital of Surinam in South America. At the age of two, his parents moved to settle Schalkwijk, a suburb of Haarlem, in the Netherlands. Schalkwijk is the home of many talented artists, musicians, DJs, and producers who have achieved greatness in the world of music. DJ Carlito grew up with people like Kid Crash, Rockattack Ten, Shy Rock aka Rollarocka, DJ / producer Martijn ten Velden, calling themselves Homeboys from da Block, which later partly formed the P-Funk group called GOTCHA. Also, people like DJ Zki aka The Goodman, Jay KR aka Jerome, his brother Ro aka Robedope Ro,DJ Georgio, DJ Marnix, DJ Alexander Koning, DJ Marcello, and DJ Olaf Basovski, until the new generation of people like Pete Philly, Relax,..\r\n“For more than 25 years I have stayed underground, touching the musical surface from time to time,” says DJ Carlito. “It started with hip hop, and by the time I got to hip house and acid house, the house virus had infected me. Early on, I was inspired by the few good DJs who really knew what was going on, peeps like DJ KC The Funkaholic, DJ Cassie 6, DJ Dr Tjong and DJ Zki aka Good Men aka Rene from Gaston.”\r\nA true player with an allround vision, DJ Carlito moved to Amsterdam where those DJs became his colleagues in a club called Club Havana. At 17, DJ Carlito (then DJ Carlos) was the youngest DJ ever to infiltrate the Amsterdam club scene.\r\n\r\nResidencies:\r\nDuring the 1990’s DJ Carlito had residencies or played in the most famous clubs in Amsterdam: Club Havana, Richter, RoXY, It, Paradiso, Sinners in Heaven, Melkweg, and The Escape. Carlos played alongside DJs like Armand van Helden, Derek Carter, Ricky Montenari, Alton Miller, Mustapha, and a lot of national heroes like Graham B, Johnson Frankie D, Brian S, Chaos and L-Dopa, Roog and Erik E, Don Diablo, Joost van Bellen, Ronny Hammond, Ritzy Lee, Urvinson, Marcello, Dimitri, Benny Rodrigues, and Ron van Zelst. “This list goes on and on, so for those who are not mentioned: U KNOW WHO U ARE !!!”\r\n\r\nUnique sound:\r\nIn 2000, DJ Carlito got busy with a new sound called UK Garage, which later became 2 Step. DJ Carlito became a key player and organized parties playing with people like Afrika Bambaataa, MJ Cole, Zed Bias, Artful Dodger, Craig David, Stanton Warriors, The Streets, Dee Kline, Femme Fatale, and Ian Pooley just to name a few.  \r\n“My sound mixes UK Garage / 2 Step with old school up-tempo hip hop and old school English break beat to spice it up a bit,” says DJ Carlito. “With all the sounds I mix, I refuse to narrow my vision. I combine old and new music. I use music that I believe in and that moves me.”\r\n\r\nEver-exciting:\r\nIn 2002, DJ Carlito teamed up with his brother, DJ Urvinson (DJ / remixer / songwriter / producer), to launch Brothers in Harmony which includes live musicians playing over their DJ set. Since then, they’ve built a reputation for their tight, funky sets and no-nonsense musical choices. Big events and companies approach them wanting their ever-exciting sound. “Allround is the style we play,” says DJ Carlito “It is very broad and moves across different styles of jazz into hip hop / R&B and goes from disco to different styles of house, and through break beats and broken beats to uplifting rough funk and obscure rare grooves to nu-soul and nu-jazz followed by Drum & Bass, if the mood and crowd is right.”\r\n\r\nReleases As a producer / remixer, DJ Carlito’s first 12-inch record was a remix on the Ron van Zelst track, Whatever, released on Dazzle Records (1996). After a long break, he came into contact with DJ Whale from Norway, who was visiting Amsterdam. After corresponding for a while, DJ Whale moved to Amsterdam to check out the scene and to start a label called Mid-Nite Sessions. “The track that I made with DJ Whale, Whale Carlito, (2003) was about to come out when the label moved back to Norway,” says DJ Carlito. “They had had five successful releases. Our deep house track is still not released or signed.”\r\n\r\nDJ Carlito’s latest unsigned releases, Epsilon Theta and Divine Previews, are two E.P. projects with a total of four tracks on each E.P., created under his pseudonym, Logan MacRide, in co-operation with Greek producer Alex Roudos. One of the tracks, Liquid X-Pectations, was signed and released on 1 June 2006 on the 12-inch vinyl, Guitartronics (Blue Dove Records). Guitartronics received rave reviews from Frisky Radio / Interference Productions, Bedrock Breaks, Tigerhook / Bedrock / Renaissance, and others. Later in 2006, Liquid X-Pectations was released on the double compilation, Eclectic Dance (PlusRec Records, the official dance sub-label of Universal Greece).\r\n\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "DJ Cellie | Hypnotic Global House Beats |His love for music began at the age of five when he learned how to play the piano. Cellie's DJ-career started in 1984, playing disco, electro, rap, funk, rare-grooves and new-wave in clubs all over Holland, Germany and Spain.\r\n\r\nIn '89 he returned to Amsterdam and started working in club Mazzo as floor-manager/programmer [booking bands and DJ's], and picked up DJ-ing again. Here he started organizing the popular Saturday-nights called 'Unity' which became a huge success.\r\nAfter a few years he decided to team up with the London based Sex Love And Motion and brought Londons popular S.L.A.M. nights to Amsterdam at Mazzo.\r\nAugust 2000 was the last of these weekly events and in September 2000 Cellie started a new venture named 'Off The Record', (a tech-house/techno concept to freshen up the Amsterdam nightlive). These nights were co-hosted by DJs Steve Rachmad, Estoe & Carlijn and became popular by techno lovers.\r\n\r\n• Besides playing in Mazzo Cellie played all over the world, London, Bristol [Soundshaft, Full Circle, Lakota], Paris [Queen, Rex], USA [New York, Denver], Praque [Radost FX], South-Africa [Johannesburg], Norway [Olso], Portugal [Albufeira] are regulary, visited by this well travelled DJ.\r\n• Cellie also played some of Hollands biggest festivals such as New Frontier, Dancevalley, Mysteryland and Defcon, often in front of crowds as big as 10,000 plus.\r\n• Radio:\r\nOn national radio station SLAM-FM [Before 'NEW Dance Radio'] Cellie appeared several years between 20:00 and 22:00 at the 'Clubmix Today'. He also guested on Radio Airpeace, Gooyland FM, System, VPRO, FG [Paris], Radio 100 and Amsterdam FM.\r\n\r\nHis music can be described as Hypnotic Global House -ranging from break-beats and techhouse edging towards progressive and (minimal)techno- always uplifting, pumping & groovy.\r\n\r\n",

The Dutch DJ and Producer likes to keep an open approach to music. With this open vision and a merger of different influences like hip-hop and reggae, Dennis creates his recognizable sound, supported by the likes of Umek, Roger Sanchez, Fatboy Slim, Stefano Noferini, Erik Morillo and many others. Superstar DJ Roger Sanchez refers to Dennis Ramoon as a “Power House Producer”, which covers it perfectly. \r\n\r\nBorn in the early eighties, Dennis grew up in an era where hip-hop and house music were just making their debut in the world. Being a fan of underground rap and early house music he developed a passion for strong beats at an early age. Now in his own musical career this has become a key feature in his sound. “I make music for the clubs so that people can dance and have a good time. For me powerful beats and a great groove are fundamental for a quality club night”, he says.\r\n\r\nDennis Ramoon is fortunate to have signed to top notch labels like Nervous Records, Hotfingers, Hed Kandi, King Street Sound and many others. Dennis has collaborated with artists such as Dutch house legend Roog and D.O.N.S. He had the pleasure to remix for artists like Eddie Amador and the honor to remix the prominent eighties house classic “Big Fun”.  \r\n\r\nWith a release catalog spanning over 50 releases and remixes, a steady number 1 position for three months and numerous other chart positions, a guest mix for Roger Sanchez’ “Release Yourself” radio show as well as heavy weight DJs playing his music in the biggest clubs and festivals around the world, it is safe to say Dennis has put his mark on the international dance scene.",

At the age of three he moved to the Netherlands with his Dutch parents. His passion for electronic music started when he was only 12 years old, when he received a cassette tape full of Acid House and Detroit Techno back in 1989. From that moment on, the beats were instantly a consistent factor in his life. As the dance scene developed over the years, so did DiMarco by exploring the diversity of perspectives related to his passion. Gradually over time his dreams expanded and so in 1998 he started spinning with friends who shared his passion. Only a year later he moved to Aruba and became a resident DJ at The Music Factory, known then as one of the hottest clubs of the island, where he made the crowd go insane with his progressive beats. After that he performed in several clubs in Canada, UK and Holland. Ever evolving, his style these days is more techy and minimalistic, DiMarco has definitely a style of his own; his long fluent mixes full of energy, funky beats and dark melodic grooves, make him an artist which can not be defined as unilateral but rather captivating and breathtaking. DiMarco explains; “My mixes are long and deep as I want to bring people into my world. I’m telling them a story when I spin, I like to take the crowd on a journey, with ups and downs, but always with lots of energy. After all, they do come to dance...” DiMarco is constantly looking for new ways to complement his love for music. Now he is using 4 decks & FX and another new exciting chapter has come; it was time for him to get in the studio and so currently DiMarco is producing his own music. His style is not easy to categorize since it is a mix of deep, funky, minimalistic and experimental house and techno. Check it out for yourself and experience DiMarco’s unique sound! But there is more to say about this enterprising artist; DiMarco also performs live together with fellow DJ/producer Jorick Croes as the duo Croes & DiMarco. Together they take minimal house and techno (or Ouze) to the next level. In 2008 DiMarco became part of MProductionz, MProductionz is a group of talented DJ/ producers, which also organizes their own events. At these “Meer of Minder” club nights, which DiMarco is hosting, you will hear the label’s unique style of music. The “ Meer of Minder” parties, currently at Rotterdam’s number one club Catwalk, are a big success and so the plans are to expand through out the Netherlands to share their sound! \r\n\r\nDiMarco is a directive member of Liquid-inc and with the new label Drops he’s releasing new and innovating minimal, techhouse and techno. He also hosts a monthly radio show called Tech Drops on Digitally Imported radio (www.di.fm) every last thursday of the month from 20.00 till 22.00 CET.\r\n\r\nKeep an eye on this genuine talented artist as DiMarco there is a lot more coming...!\r\n",

  "cover_photo": "",
  "artist_bio": "Het klassieke muzikanten verhaal is ook van toepassing op deze Dj. Op jonge leeftijd kwam D-Rok (Daan Koekelkoren, 8 juni 1987) in contact met muziek, iets dat zijn leven voorgoed zou veranderen. D-Rok was namelijk een getalenteerde drummer in zijn tienerjaren, en nadat hij in aanraking kwam met funk en soul op slechts negen jarige leeftijd groeide hij dankzij de vele samples steeds dichter naar de muziek van de straat: hiphop.Na op jonge leeftijd zijn eerste set gekocht te hebben, groeide zijn ambitie om alle technieken van de draaitafels te beheersen. Zijn ontdekkingsreis langs vele muziekstijlen, heeft hem gevormd tot de DJ die we nu kennen. Zijn sets staan in het teken van House, Funk, Soul, Boogie, HipHop en Disco. Oftewel: zwarte muziek in de breedste zin van het woord. \r\nAangemoedigd door HipHop pioniers zoals DJ Knowhow (o.a. bekend van VPRO's Dutch Masters en producer van de hits van Brainpower en Extince) staat D-Rok garant voor 'straatwaarde', maar ook diepe kennis van de historie en achtergrond van elke plaat. Dit bewijst hij iedere week weer in zijn columns voor thepostonline.nl, waarin hij dieper ingaat op onderwerpen die spelen in het muzikale landschap. Dit in samenwerking met een scherpe mening, zorgt voor een combinatie waar velen wekelijks naar uitkijken. \r\nSinds 2009 kennen we D-Rok onder andere van zijn periode als DJ van Caro Emerald (zij scoorde diverse internationale hits met o.a. “A Night like This”), maar is hij ook te vinden in de top van het Amsterdamse nachtleven: Zijn residentie bij (o.a) Wicked Jazz Sounds is berucht en befaamd, terwijl zijn eigen productie Zwarte Koffie binnen anderhalf jaar de Club Up ontgroeid is, en nu te vinden is op de eerste vrijdag van de maand in de Paradiso. Toch is het nog steeds mogelijk om je maandelijkse dosis koffie in de Up te drinken. Op 9 januari 2014 is namelijk het kleine zusje van Zwarte Koffie geboren; Koffie Verkeerd. Iedere tweede donderdag van de maand is de puurste Disco en Boogie te horen in de Club Up.\r\nSinds 2011 heeft hij een residentie bij de Rotterdamse nachtclub Bird, waar hij één van de mede organisatoren van Lovebirds is. Samen met Conchitta Bottse zet hij iets unieks neer. Lovebirds is namelijk niet alleen een vast gezicht in Rotterdam, maar ook in Amsterdam. Een keer per maand staat de Melkweg in het teken van het beste dat zwarte muziek te bieden heeft. Ook is D-Rok een bekend gezicht op de nationale festivals. Zo stond hij dit jaar op het North Sea Jazz Festival, en sloot hij op zondag Lowlands af.   \r\nAls hij draait geniet hij er zienderogen van. Het publiek hoort niet alleen zijn zeer dansbare en subtiele tunes, maar ziet ook een muziekliefhebber in hart en nieren bewegen op de beste tracks die de speakers uitknallen. Naast zijn DJ werk is hij ook vaak te vinden in de Soul Planet Studios waar hij produceert voor internationale opdrachtgevers, van remixes tot complete albums. Dit alles maakt hem niet alleen een DJ, maar ook artiest en producer. Combineer dit met kennis van vele stijlen en gevarieerde sets, en kom zelf beleven wat er met het publiek gebeurd als hij een avond muzikaal verzorgt.\r\n",

But for those who are not familiar with Dollkraut, it should be pointed out that most of his songs can't be labelled as house music. Forget style talk, it's all about his unique sound and feeling that's both nostalgic and futuristic.\r\n\r\nDollkraut also received a lot of attention for his stunning reworks of Brandt Brauer Frick and Paul Frick feat. Emika. He managed to create \"fake originals\": many people were convinced that his versions were the originals and the originals were the remixes...\r\n",

From that day he changed his style from early rave and techno to the minimalistic tech sounds, with a funky twist of house. In the year 2008 Don started a bookings & events company called COSMOCAD.\r\n\r\nNext to that he worked on a new project called Don Do’nuts, which is a dj set with live components, which is still in progress. In 2009/2010 he started organizing club nights and outdoor festivals. He worked with artists such as: Felix Kröcher, Chris Liebing, Michel de Hey, Egbert, Kombinat 100, André Galluzzi, Gabriël Ananda, Pan Pot and many more. Nowadays he is responsible for events like Der Wanderzirkus, Schoften & Schavuiten and Fridge.\r\n\r\nDon is an entertainer, crazy character and slave to the music.\r\n\r\nSince recent Don has colaborated with live musician Sander, better known as Proloog on sax.\r\n\r\nDon and Sander have been colleagues at heart for several years. Sander used to be very involved in the Ska and Jazz scene. His passion for the sax was evident in his performances at the various Jazz festivals he played, both in The Netherlands as well as abroad. Sander also performed with the most famous Ska band in the USA.\r\n\r\nAt the time that both men very busy with their own music, they decided one day to see if they could put their creative skills together. Their collaboration debuted at a summer festival, where they were graciously received by the audience, their friends, as well as professionals in the industry.\r\n\r\nSince then they have been performing together as an exclusive act. The meshing of ideas and improvisation in their summery sound is a tribute to how well the men click as a team.\r\n\r\nDon Lennon also has formed a dj duo with dj Wesdex and play together as \"Vegie\". \r\nThey create an intens warm musical feeling of deep tech and housy music.\r\n\r\nMore info wil follow soon.",

After being involved in a number of groundbreaking projects, dj/producer Edwin Oosterwal is taking things to the next level. With a critically acclaimed solo-début on his own Rejected imprint and gigs in some of Europe’s leading clubs, an international breakthrough is inevitable.\r\n\r\nEdwin started dj-ing in the East of Holland, where he was studying to be an engineer and first met his friend and future musical patner in crime Joris Voorn. Mixing all types of music for tough crowds, Edwin soon mastered the craft of dance floor wizardry. Deejaying remained a passion in those days, only to become the main focus in later years. Edwin’s engineering endeavours brought him to all corners of the world, picking up different musical influences along the way. His years in Sydney broadened and deepened his take on electronic music. Living in NYC helped further develop Edwin’s historical perception. \r\n\r\nEdwin returned to Dutch shores in 2005 a seasoned musical connoisseur. He soon hooked back up with Joris, who at the time was making a serious career out of spinning and producing. The two of them started Rejected – production outfit, dj-team and label. From the first release it was clear that Rejected had international appeal. For The People, Cliché and Let’s Go Juno ended up in all the right record bags. Moreover, as a label manager for Rejected and the more techno-oriented Green, Edwin also helped sign such pivotal releases as Pitto’s Feelin’ and 360’s Neon.\r\n\r\nAfter more than fifteen years of paying his dues and biding his time, Edwin finds an old dream fulfilled. Not only is he heading two of Holland’s leading electronic music labels. He is also touring the world with his own contemporary take on the sound he has been representing since the early nineties – as Rejected and by himself. Awakenings, Fabric and Panoramabar are only the beginning. The rest is set to follow suit.",

  "artist_bio": "Like so many music stories, this one begins in the early 80s, or 1983 to be precise...\"Like so many music stories, this one begins in the early 80s, or 1983 to be precise. That was the year that Jeroen Van Der Star now more commonly known as DJ TLR, played his first DJ gig. As he recalls: “Somehow I have always played records. I think my first time was when I was twelve spinning bargain bin Culture Club and Grandmaster Flash and Stevie Wonder 7\"es for my classmates on a single turntable with a microphone”\r\n\r\nIt was an inauspicious start to a long and colourful career. Following his high school days, Jeroen and his friends first played at jungle parties but soon began to come under the influence of The Hague’s squat parties. Organised mainly by the Acidplanet collective, these events brought together all the freaks residing in the Dutch administrative capital.\r\n\r\nElectronic music wasn’t the only soundtrack in TLR’ life and, as a child of the 80s and 90s, he lived through periods of radical cultural change.  “I'm lucky enough to have witnessed the early years of most of the major music genres up close - Hip Hop, House, Techno, Jungle and to an extent Electro, Disco, 80s Pop, Wave, but also Punk, Hardcore, Garage Rock and all the sub genres it spawned in the 90s,” he explains.\r\n\r\nWhile he dug the Bunker Records parties, he only connected on a musical level with the label as the decade neared its end. By then, he was spinning as DJ TLR - “you just pick something when it doesn't seem to matter and then you're stuck with it,” he says of the name - and the first international gigs and as he says himself, ‘remote chances of a professional career’ had started to materialize.\r\n\r\nThose possibilities soon became a reality as the 90s morphed into the 00s and the West Coast of Holland started to gain recognition for underground electronic artists like Legowelt, Orgue Electronique, Alden Tyrell and Rude 66. Around the same time, TLR set up the pre-social media Global Darkness web forum to connect with like-minded electro/jak-aholics around the globe and concurrently established his own label, Creme Organization.\r\n\r\nOriginally home to local artists like Danny Wolfers - under his various guises – and Orgue Electronique, the label has since welcomed producers from around the world, including Bangkok Impact, Alexander Robotnick, JTC and Willie Burns, while releasing acclaimed albums from D'Marc Cantu, Neville Watson and DJ Overdose.\r\n\r\nDespite his DJ background, TLR says that Crème wasn’t set up to release music that he would play out. “A lot of the early Creme stuff was not really about the clubs, we always were more in a freak zone, it never really worked for big floors, with some exceptions here and there,” he explains, adding that he admires DJs who are selectors as much as technical DJs, with Farley Jackmaster Funk, Ben Liebrand, DJ Hype, I-F, Guy Tavares and newer names like Traxx, Speculator, Ben UFO, Will Bankhead and Ron Morelli all cited as influential.\r\n\r\nThe same rationale that led him to set up Crème now underscores R-Zone, Crème’s sub-label. Inspired by the early part of the 90s, in particular the intersection of rave and hard-core with techno, this sub-label allows well-known producers to put out esoteric music anonymously.\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, TLR keeps one ear on the past and the other on the present. He recently put together an excellent Bunker retrospective mix - “there is such an immense body of work that you can cherry pick yourself into oblivion, so why not take advantage of that” - and regularly makes new mixes available via the Crème Soundcloud. These selections document his changing DJ style.\r\n\r\nOn the road most weekends, the best place to catch TLR’s grainy interpretation of electronic music is out among the freaks. “I don't have a favorite place to play really, because it’s always different, even in the same clubs - but I like places that are dark, have a booming sound system and a rowdy crowd” he says.\r\n\r\nSounds like the perfect combination for the crème de la crème of West Coast selectors.\"",

That night proved to be an eyeopener: the passion for techno had arrived. Frequent visits to techno parties across the country followed.\r\n\r\nInspired by the music he borrowed his first turntables. Quickly after that he had is own equipement together.After doing well for several years he teamed up with Ivo van der Zeyst (his partner in crime at the first party he ever visited). Named Locomotiv they played at parties in and around Amsterdam like the underground location of Amsterdam ‘de Bunker’, the TWSTd Queensday stage and at all the parties of the organisation Hooft: the parties at Villa Rust in je Hooft and a gig in Sweden.\r\n\r\nIn 2011 Drum Tone went solo. Full on, but always sufisticated: he always brings people to the next level with his deep, pumping techno sound. Recently he started to produce his own music so he can tribute, with his own ideas, to nowadays techno music.\r\n\r\nHear it, feel it.\r\n\r\nBookings: tim@injehooft.nl",

  "artist_bio": "Born in The Hague, the Netherlands, Remy was bitten by the music bug in the summer of 1990. A dark murky club, lustrous lights, that thumping base, and a strange but curiously intoxicating fusion of high, medium, and low frequencies was all it took for Remy to make a sudden change of career, and a decision he has never regretted making since. \r\nA unique blend of textures and waves of pure energy is what flows through your mind and body when listening to Remy. It is sheer pleasure. And for those who have not had the opportunity to hear his sound, you have certainly been missing half of your life. For a man with a calm and to some, even a shy demeanor, the power and respect he demands while he's behind the decks is total and consuming. \r\n\r\nBorn in The Hague, the Netherlands, Remy was bitten by the music bug in the summer of 1990. A dark murky club, lustrous lights, that thumping base, and a strange but curiously intoxicating fusion of high, medium, and low frequencies was all it took for Remy to make a sudden change of career, and a decision he has never regretted making since. \r\n\r\nHe bought his own DJ set after that summer. Eventually he gained residency at all Silly Symphonies events in Holland. The Amsterdam based club RoXY soon recognized his talent and introduced Remy to a larger crowd every Saturday night. Remy has since been found at John Digweed's Bedrock nights in London as well as those famous Twilo nights in New York aside from playing all over the world. He never ceases to amaze his fans and crowds with his impeccable choice of records and flawless, tight mixing. Receiving an award from the Dutch Awards as Best DJ consecutively for 2001 and 2002, proves exactly that. \r\n\r\n\"I like to play a variety of sounds from tech-house, to techno, To English progressive, to trance. For me, the most important aspect in a record as well as a DJ set is the flow of energy in the music. The real challenge is to play for a certain type of crowd, be it techno or progressive and have them enjoying another sound without realizing that style of music has changed.\" \r\n\r\nSince the summer of 90', Remy's passion for music has only intensified. Since then, he has launched a slew of record labels such as WONKA, 'Global Cuts' together with Belgian DJ/producer Sven van Hees, AREA CODE 070 (the phone area code of Remy's residence The Hague), and of course TASTE RECORDINGS. Similarly, he has released a number of singles that have received international recognition. To name a couple, 'Mess With Da Bull' was featured on Sasha & Digweed's 'Northern Exposure Expeditions' compilation, and 'Backstabber' (DJ Remy) can be found on the Renaissance-CD by Dave Seaman. Recent releases of Remy include 'Pumped Up' (DJ Remy) and 'Spotlight' (RR Workshop). He is currently working on the release of his first artist album.",

He made his appearance on the Roman underground club scene as a dj in 2009 (Brancaleone, Alpheus), varying electronic-oriented dj-sets to more techno ones. In this period he started with Pneich a new concept named Transmission, which was engaged in the realization of events that mixed underground techno with local visual arts. At the same time, he became interested in music production and realized his first album, 'Beyond My Shadow' (2012), with a resonance oriented to a rather electronic atmosphere than to the dance floor. In order to sharpen his production he decided to move to Rotterdam in the fall of 2012 to attend a course in Electronic Music Production at SAE Institute, out of which a new production derived, strictly orienting itself to recent evolutions in techno music, from dub to modern and dark techno.",

  "artist_bio": "Vortex' mixes are smooth and flawless. His interesting musical choice has a refreshing and energetic sound. He easily adjusts to any situation creating a satisfied audience. Because of his routine gained in the past years as a DJ, it is no problem for him to build up a party nicely or play an excellent set at peaktime hours.Born in 1975, Pim Verhaagen a.k.a. Vortex was interested in electronic music from the early age of 12, when he started collecting synthesizer tunes from artists like Jean Michel Jarre and Kraftwerk. On a holiday to Ibiza, halfway the nineties, he experienced house music for the first time. The feel and magic of this music caught him and a career as a bedroom DJ started. His professional career was launched quickly when a respected Dutch DJ connected to the Dance Valley organization noticed one of his mixes. His first performance for an audience was at the UK hardhouse oriented HQ party in club De Melkweg (Amsterdam) and this party became his first residency. \r\n\r\nDue to his distinguished style that differed from the rest of the DJ's who played there, he gathered a small group of fans around him really quickly. He was then invited to play at the well known annual Dance Valley festivals, because of his quality warm-up DJ sets and his second residency was a fact. From this point onwards Vortex started to build up a name and he was invited to play all over the country at the best Dutch clubs, parties and festivals with respected DJ’s. Towards the end of the nineties hardhouse became harder and harder which was the reason for Vortex to slowly change his style of music into a more sophisticated genre called progressive. He then became a resident at the legendary Deep label parties through which he was offered a gig at the Extrema festival in 2001. \r\n\r\n2000 was the year that Vortex became involved in the founding of Xpander; a website bringing upfront news, reviews, etc. referring to forward thinking dance music. Vortex coordinated the label and review section from scratch. Xpander works with a team of volunteers from all over the world and Vortex quickly gathered an international network of contacts around him. This offered him the opportunity to play outside Holland: Tokyo, New York and Ibiza are a few destinations to which he had been invited for DJ-ing. \r\n\r\nHis mix: Vortex' mixes are smooth and flawless. His interesting musical choice has a refreshing and energetic sound. He easily adjusts to any situation creating a satisfied audience. Because of his routine gained in the past years as a DJ, it is no problem for him to build up a party nicely or play an excellent set at peaktime hours. \r\n\r\nHis style: As a master of mixing warm and melodic deephouse with techhouse and (minimal) housy tunes, it's time for Vortex to show his skills for a wider audience in parts of the world where good quality underground house music is presented, played and... respected. Vortex respects new and talented producers in today's hectic and commercialized world of dance music. This inspires him to produce and play music in an innovative way. He realizes the need of listening to all kinds of music and performing artists. Being up-to-date is the only way to be a step ahead. \r\n\r\nHis gigs: Besides his performance in The Liquid Room in Tokyo, Vortex also played the decks at New York's Club Fun, he played several times on Ibiza, The Dance Valley, Extrema and Impulz festivals and every quality club in The Netherlands like De Melkweg (Amsterdam), Paradiso (Amsterdam), Panama (Amsterdam), Nighttown (Rotterdam), Mazzo (Amsterdam), Stalker (Haarlem), Doornroosje (Nijmegen), Cozmik (Rotterdam), LVC (Leiden), etc.",

Two years ago they met up, and ever since things have been a rough ride. When Chris accidentally put on his 3d glasses during the first studio session, he undoubtedly set a new fashion trend, but more importantly established Duotone’s best kept secret in pursuit of that extra dimension in music. \r\n\r\nAlthough studio sessions can be monotone for some, duotone is all about contrast and diversity, sometimes to devastating effect. Duotone is like a diesel engine. It takes a while to start up, but it’s almost impossible to stop. Chris is responsible for the smoke; as four packs during one session hardly leaves one unscathed. Auke in turn, has an overload of energy, hardly enjoyable during early mornings, but packing quite a punch when in dire need. \r\n\r\nThus far they have been on a neotrance, techno infused safari, stopping at labels such as Deep Focus and Hotkitchen, and more recently Satoshi Tommiie’s SAW Recordings together with Paris house legend DJ Yellow, reeling in raving reviews from the techno elite. \r\n\r\nTheir live set road tour last year, with Dave Clarke, was a taster for what is yet to come. A kazillion of releases and collaborations with the likes of Yellow, the infamous Applescal, Eelke Kleijn and a host of others, are about to be unleashed. Watch this space..\r\n\r\n",

They then started to get together to combine their ideas about creating music, resulting in their first joint vinyl release in 2006 on Media records Germany.\r\n\r\nSeveral releases followed (vinyl as well as digital) on Stolen Moments, Minimal Sound Noise and Instabil, and soon they decided to take their own sound on stage with a live-act.\r\n\r\nToday, having truly found their own techno sound, they take it on stage once again in a dynamic 2-man live-act, while at the same time maintaining a steady pace of releasing tracks (both as a duo as individually) by labels such as Hypnotic Room, Translucent and Gynoid Audio, Limited and Cromosom. \r\n\r\nIf you’re looking for deep, dark, dubby, moody beats, Pjotr G & Dubiosity deliver what they promise!\r\n",

Over the years, this pre-talent has been transformed into seamless and fierce DJ skills. Started out with watching DMC championchips, he refined his techniques and applied this in his performances. When finished his high-school the relocation to Rotterdam and now Amsterdam, he discovered house music in the record stores. He explored different genres when he deejayed a lot on Asian Parties. Meanwhile he won several deejay-contests (Amsterdam Student Festival) and got into the finals of the Diepstraten Dance Award. \r\n\r\nIt were icons such as Daft Punk, Julien Jabre, Mark Farina and Derrick Carter who inspired him playing house music. His experience makes him a very versatile artist. Not only he handles house music with strong signatures from New York, Chicago and Berlin: he could easily perform lounge and down and midtempo music in his deejay sets. \r\n\r\nInevitably Saturn has been encouraged & respected by icons from the industry. During the past decade he has DJ'ed extensively with beloved underground moments and peak-time boogie-flavoured sets. Internationally it has brought him to reknown places such as Ministry of Sound, Pacha [London], Face Club [China], Culture Club, Stereo Sushi [Belgium], Black Sheep, White Law Hotel [Miami WMC]. \r\n\r\nIn the Netherlands his deliverance in clubs and parties has built him a wide resumé, containing festivals, established clubs, beachclubs and underground bars/ nights, collaborating with national/ international artists and musicans. While promoting his own Nu Even Deephouse events in the Zeeland coast area, he creates strong vibrations at his hometown beaches throughout the year! In 2010, this will be the fifth annual season. \r\n\r\nWith all the movements, he is now cultivating his remix projects and productions.",

Other releases out on Armada Music, System Recordings and Monstercat shortly.Hi, we are Ducked Ape, a producer/dj duo from The Netherlands.\r\n\r\nMore personally, we are Sjoerd Huissoon and Tim van Doorne. We both love music, live in The Hague and create deep house and indie dance music together. \r\n\r\nWe started Ducked Ape in 2011. Since that moment, we signed with Heroic management and AT Publishing. That year we played at Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE), and gained the interest of Dennis Ruyer and Sander Kleinenberg with our first single and videoclip \"Le Dernier Soir\", and our remix of DI-RECT's hit-single \"Long Way Home\".\r\n\r\nOccasionally we create new tunes at the Red Bull Studios Amsterdam, and play all our new tracks at our residency at Heroic's club night \"WARENHAUS\", every Thursday at the Supermarkt in The Hague. Besides, we love to film ourselves during our \"Lazy Live Sessions\" where we record our dj-sets at various places and invite other guest dj's to join us in a lazy moment.\r\n\r\nRecently, our edit of Ludovico Einaudi's \"Una Mattina\" reached over 100K plays. Also, we released our single \"Come And Get It feat. Paolo Ravley\" on Armada Music, which is played frequently on Dutch national Radio 538 Dance Department. We are very happy we can spread love to more and more people with our music.\r\n\r\nCheck our gigs schedule for the dates of all our dj-sets.

While both his parents were in the ring making their acrobatic manoeuvres, behind the curtains he started listening and loving the sounds of an audience at a very young age. At ten years old his family started settling down in the Netherlands to provide him and his brothers a normal childhood. But the influences to wanting to become an artist himself later on, already had taken place.\r\n\r\nAltough his life had taken a huge turn, the passion for any kind of performing arts started to grow step by step. At a certain point, gradually, music made his entry. At the age of fifteen his career as a deejay started. Inspired by DMC video tapes he began playing in high school bands using the turntable as an instrument. One year later he got his first job as a resident playing saturday nights at the local discotheque mixing up soul, funk & hip-hop. Meanwhile in the summers, he worked with his brother throughout European nightlife with a variety of circus acts. But moving to Amsterdam to study just before his twentieth birthday his music journey really started to develop.\r\n\r\nAfter getting his degree in school he became part of the infamous duo MM&SD, putting himself on the map within the AMS nightlife playing bootleg disco while entertaining the crowd with their appearance. Slowly but steadily their reputation grew throughout the rest of the Netherlands as well performing at al the number one festivals. And now playing records for quite some time now, he started a new chapter with Django Gitano. Playing and producing soulfull deep house.",

In 2008 she left Brabant to settle herself in Haarlem. \r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the 90's, young Sophie got into the new sound of House music and was instantly caught. She started to collect vinyl and wanted to become a DJ. In the middle of the 90's she played many styles of dance music mainly on private parties. In the early 2000's Sophie took a short break in her carreer.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 Sophie came back and more then ever determined to become as DJ. It is her passion, her life. Nowadays she's playing CD's instead of vinyl and has developed her own style of sound. With this fully matured style Sophie is more fanatic than before. The underground sound from the 90's is the inspiration for her steady sound. Sophie translates the old vibe and atmosphere of it with the sounds of the present.\r\nDepending on the events and parties she's at, Sophie plays a (deep) House / Tech-House / Techno oriented sound. It is a warm mix of melodious, touching rhythm and a catchy groove. No hard house and mainstream hits, but complaisant quality underground sound.\r\n\r\nSophie performed at local clubs as well as Stalker, Sugar Factory, LVC and on the beach at Woodstock69. She also she played at City Radio Breda, Electronation Radio and XT3 Techno Radio, which was a real pleasure and resulted in many positive responses. In march 2010 Sophie won the Female DJ Contest in Amsterdam at club Escape.\r\nToday Sophie is more busy than before. In the near future she'd like to play at bigger parties and festivals and hope enjoy much people with hear sound.\r\n\r\nFor more info and bookings check;\r\nwww.djsophie.nl / sophie@djsophie.nl \r\nhttp://soundcloud.com/djsophie \r\nalso she is on facebook under the name; Sophie Riel van",

This\r\nturntable virtuoso started dj’ing at the age of 16 and now eleven years running, making his mark in\r\nboth the club and turntablism scene, he is nowhere near of stopping.\r\nBorn in South-Korea and later moving to Holland, Rockid learned to love music from an early age. In\r\n1996 he knew that turntables would be his instruments with which he could express his love of\r\nmusic with. To further develop his skills he entered the DMC DJ championships in 1998. You could\r\neasily say that he got this down and he went on to being the Dutch DMC champ for five years in a\r\nrow , representing Holland and making it all the way to the finals in New York, London & Paris.\r\nHolding an extensive list of titles to his name Rockid brought it all back the clubs to rock the dance\r\nfloors. Having deep roots in Hip Hop, Rockid has his own style, vision, taste and way of mixing dance\r\nmusic. His musical journey brought him to play practically every club in Holland, popular national\r\nfestivals like Mysteryland, FFWD dance parade, ADE and Dancevalley, and international festivals like\r\nGlastonbury and the Detroit Electronic Music Festival. With the undeniable raw street feel he brings\r\nto electronic dance music blending Electro, Baltimore breaks, Favela funk, Hiphop Bootytech, Jackin\r\n& Ghetto House he is well on his way to also make his mark in the dance scene.\r\nAs we are heading towards the end of 2008, after numerous mix tapes, Rockid is on the verge of\r\nreleasing his first official singles. As Rockid is excited to focus more on the production side of this\r\ngame and share it with the rest of the world, we can only expect from him.......well the unexpected!",

  "artist_bio": "Dubstep DJ/Producer and founding father of the bi-monthly BIG UP! parties in a local venue called Victorie, Alkmaar, NL.\r\n\r\nDZD2 started DJ-ing back in 1997, playing a variety of dnb/jungle/breakcore/hiphop/detroit electro/miami bass and turntableism. He developed his skills swiftly and smashed parties under his former moniker DJ ZoRQ. In 2002 he was struck with RSI so he had to quit his scratching and decided to go with drum n bass all the way.. He organized lots of parties (Battle of the Breakz and Raunchy Ruckus) in different venues in his local area and played some outside as well (UK & FR)..In 2008 he felt he got bored with drum n bass, the diversity and freshness had turned stale.. He didn't buy dnb records anymore and felt a bit lost....\r\n\r\nBy accident he came across dubstep which gave him the new energy he was looking for! Heavy Bass Music entered his life and now he playes the whole spectrum. He changed the name of his BOTB parties to: BIG UP! and changed his name to: DZD2. He is not about one subgenre only, his experience in DJ-ing gave him the ability to take you on a musical journey instead of just mindlessly smashing anthems, his mixing is impeccable, fast and vinyl only (unless he drops one of his own tracks).\r\nAs a producer he is growing fast, dubstep is like a second nature and his productions gained good response from the floor!\r\n\r\nSome names he had on the BIG UP! bill are: MENSAH, GOMES, BRUTUZZ, APHRODITE, BLACK SUN EMPIRE, THE QEMISTS, AKKACHAR, DEFORMER, TECHNICAL ITCH, NOISIA and there's more to come!\r\n\r\nfor bookings mail: dj.dzd2@gmail.com\r\n\r\n",

In 2004, while she played with Quazar on festivals like Free Your Mind, Dance Valley and Mysteryland, Dorine also got her big break as a DJ. That year she became resident in Mick Boskamp's radioshow 'Magazine' on ID&T Radio as well as on the Welcome to the future events in club NL. Since then she's played in almost all Amsterdam clubs, from Paradiso and Melkweg to Zyon, Powerzone, Twstd, Vaaghuyzen, Studio 80 and Kashmir Lounge as well as on festivals like Free Your Mind, Sweet Vibes and Rockit. Dorine Dorado (a name given to her by Hearttrob) is currently recording tracks for her first release, to be released sometime later this year, while as a dj she definitely found her niche. Recently she made a big impression with uncompromising and deep dj-sets on the 'Bla bla' party in the NDSM-bunker, the 'Rotzooii vs Welcome to the future'-event in Studio 80 and the Xmas edition of 'Voltt' in the Amsterdam Paradiso.",

  "artist_bio": "Fedde le Grand is the famous Dutch DJ and producer behind the catchy electrohouse number 'Put Your Hands Up For Detroit'.Fedde Le Grand\r\n\r\nEnjoying artistic freedom afforded only an elite few, Fedde Le Grand is a masterful pioneer of electronica, considered by countless fans and artists as one of the single most defining figures in house music. Whether as DJ or producer, Fedde’s influence can be felt throughout the electronic landscape; his creative beats, grooves, melodies and rhythms surround us.\r\n\r\nBack in 2006, it was the seminal electro track ‘Put Your Hands Up For Detroit’ that not only brought Le Grand to global attention, but breathed fresh life into a stagnant house scene. Dubbed by many as the “Saviour of House”, it soon became evident that the Dutchman was no one-trick pony. Amongst others, tracks like ‘Let Me Think About It’, ‘Control Room’, ‘Sparks’, his remixes of Coldplay’s ‘Paradise’ and EBTG’s ‘Missing’, ‘The Creeps’, ‘So Much Love’, ‘Metrum’, ‘Autosave’, ‘Back & Forth’, ‘RAW’ and lastly his amazing remix for Nikki Williams’ ‘Glowing’ have established him as one of the most exciting and consistent talents around, demonstrating his effortless ability to move seamlessly between huge mainstream success and edgier, underground sounds. His 2009 debut artist album ‘Output’ was released in an incredible 64 countries worldwide, establishing him as one of the foremost creative forces in electronic music, while 2011 saw him accomplish a record-breaking 5 Beatport #1 tracks – including his reworking of ‘Paradise’ which earned him an opening set for Chris Martin’s super-band in Madrid. Increasingly in demand for his remix skills, Fedde’s talents have been called upon by a host of musical superstars, including Madonna, Coldplay and Robbie Williams to Will.i.am, Moby and Fatboy Slim. \r\n\r\nNot only indulging in his own perfectionist musical tendencies, Fedde also nurtures new talent through his Flamingo imprint, using his years of hard-earned experience to push them towards superstardom. Nicky Romero, Deniz Koyu and Danny Avila are just some of the fledging talents that Fedde has already helped explode into the mainstream, and 2013 looks set to continue the trend with unknown artists set to breakthrough under Fedde’s guiding hand.\r\n\r\nOutside of the studio and around the globe hundreds of thousands have witnessed show-stopping live sets that explode with ingenuity and originality. Huge performances across continents are par for the course for Le Grand, with the likes of Coachella, Exit Festival, Global Gathering, Electric Zoo, Mysteryland, Tomorrowland, Electric Daisy Carnival, Future Music and many more firmly under his belt. His residency at London’s Ministry of Sound has become renowned as a world-class showcase of electro and house, continually selling out to roadblock crowds; his set at Ultra Music Festival 2012 was widely hailed as the best across the mammoth weekend, and to add a final much-lauded feather to his already crammed cap, he holds the coveted position as global headline resident for the jaw-dropping Sensation parties. \r\n\r\nIn 2012 Fedde announced the expansion of his critically-acclaimed Dark Light Sessions radio show from its birthplace in the US on broadcasting behemoth SiriusXM to stations across the planet, with countries as far spread as Brazil, Australia, Germany, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Russia and more now receiving his blistering 60 minute mix on a weekly basis, earning the Dutchman an increasing hold on major dance music markets around the world. \r\n\r\nYet through all the success – the international chart-topping heights and global DJ fame –  Fedde’s focus is simply fixed on making and playing great tracks. His dedication to music and his unwavering passion for the dancefloor continue to make him an intrinsic and dominant part of the ever-evolving electronic scene. A touchstone, an inspiration and a pioneer; he is definitive, he is essential, he is house music at its finest. He is Fedde Le Grand. \r\n",

With a bunch of hugely inspiring friends he started playing all kinds of music and experimenting with a whole bunch of electronic devises. Over the last 6 years this bunch of techno kids grew up to be the now renowned crew called Bar27.\r\n\r\nAs a resident DJ and one of the founders of the Bar27 collective he organizes and plays at their own club nights, events and stages at festivals like Mysteryland and Source.

  "artist_bio": "Eelke Kleijn is a rare talent. With work stretching across movie trailer scores, deep live shows and incredibly well formed production, he crosses a boundary from electronic producer and in to a true modern day composer. With peers and tastemakers standing up for this unmistakable imagination, the Rotterdam based music maker’s potential has no bounds.\r\n\r\nWith 2 artist albums delivered, an array of..‘Composition’ is the core of any electronic producers work - the creative process that forms a distinctive sound to them, and only them. In a landscape of talent and technology however, to be truly unique is more than ever a rare quality. Eelke Kleijn, Rotterdam-based music maker, is that exceptional example. A talent crossing the border from producer into modern day composer, he has honed a natural flair over a 10-year career but now is proving his moment. With peers and tastemakers standing up to take note of his original production, they have still only seen the half of his capacity. As the projects get bigger and better, excitement for the young Dutchman is reaching boiling point across the globe.\r\n\r\nThis raw talent was evident at the tender age of just 20 years old, as Eelke emerged on the scene with debut tracks ‘4.5 Billion Years / Knowledge Base’ on Segment Records. Deep, original tracks they were, but they also marked something so much more - the start of a decade long journey. Going on to work with some of the greatest imprints in dance music he garnered the support of Ultra to EMI, Global Underground to 3 Beat and Spinnin’ to Sudbeat and all before half a decade was up. Always one to have sole creativity of course, he learnt from these labels and it took just a few short years to set up his own venture, Outside The Box Music. Built from the ground up, OTB has gone on to release major artists from a variety of genres and not to mention Eelke’s own smashes, ‘Levensgeneiter, ‘Doordrammer’ and in 2012 ‘Eenvoud’.\r\n\r\nComposing is always at the fore of Eelke’s consciousness, but being the all round professional he is, his live shows still never take the backseat. Complete with the back catalogue of epic productions his sets are packed with anthemic floor fillers that please the crowds the world over. From Asia to South America and Australia to his home in the Netherlands, Eelke has graced the stages in the finest of venues. With dates upcoming in all four corners of the globe, Eelke is bringing his music truly worldwide to hoards of smiling faces with hands in the air.\r\n\r\nCreating records that strike a chord with music fans from all walks of life is what Eelke does best. Meticulously striving for beats and harmonies that lose the listener in a track is what he drove towards with signature tune, ‘Ein Tag Am Strand’. With the melody set years back, he developed and honed the production around it, waiting for the perfect moment to drop it to the world. As a deeper sound prevailed in all aspects of dance music in the summer of ‘13, it was the impeccable timing for it to be heard. Speaking to DMC World Magazine, Eelke detailed the simple yet pertinent reason behind putting out the track this year: “'Ein Tag' is all about feeling good. It's a happy record, one that will make you smile when you listen to it. Dance music sometimes takes itself too seriously. This track just plays with all of that, and on top of that it's catchy as hell!”\r\n\r\nLoved by Fatboy Slim, tipped by Pete Tong and on to 538’s Dance Smash the instrumental picked up rapid pace. Stepping in its shoes and building on the momentum, the vocal version of ‘Stand Up’ followed suit with the same incredible reaction. Combining the infectious tones of the original, Eelke seamlessly slotted in the vocals of rising star Tres:Or to produce a track worthy of radio gold – highlighted no less than being BBC Radio 1’s ‘Next Hype’ for Huw Stephens.\r\n\r\nBe it on the radio, in the studio or to a live crowd, Eelke Kleijn’s music is at home anywhere, and it doesn’t stop at just those three. With his productions on LA’s radar over the last few years, Hollywood came knocking to try his hand at syncing sounds to blockbuster trailers. Rattling through cinematic smashes like Parker, Wrath Of The Titans and This Means War he proved no job was too big for his compositions. Facing his biggest big screen test with Ron Howard’s Rush in September 2013, Kleijn produced his most stunning cut to date, which matched the epic teaser for one of the 2013’s hottest movies.\r\n\r\nEelke Kleijn constantly has his sights set on the biggest of endeavors. Whether it is own productions, Hollywood royalties or remixing the likes of Arcade Fire there is nothing his Midas touch cannot handle. A producer, a DJ, a cinematic synchronizer but most importantly a modern day composer, Eelke Kleijn is a rare breed of music maker, and the world has only scratched the service of his talents.",

  "artist_bio": "Envotion consists of three people, Hugo Alberts, Laurens Alberts and Stijn Halfens. \r\n\r\nEnvotion will be dedicated to making music without compromise. Hovering between the musical and the pure dancefloor oriented approach they will deliver music with more than one face. \r\n\r\nAs the past lies in producing (with releases on Sentient Records, Extrema Records, Plastic Fantastic and film music ) and DJ`ing (plays @ Paradiso, Panama, 3FM and Tribehouse) this trio will deliver during clubnights as well in the studio, both under the name of Envotion .Stijn\r\nWhen he was only thirteen years old, Envotion (Stijn) was inspired by house music through a couple of friends. He bought some turntables and got started. Through the years Stijn explored several styles as house, dub, trance and club. He got inspired by labels as Vendetta, Joshitoshi, Motorbass and Junior.  \r\n\r\nAs from 1999 Stijn focussed on his study \"Communication and Multimediadesign\". This study made his interest in producing music even bigger. That’s when he bought the tools to start creating his own music.\r\n\r\nOrganisations as Earth inspired Stijn during his search. The combination of (tech-) house and progressive were very appealing to him and it gave him the drive to produce this kind of music besides playing it.  \r\n\r\nAs with most DJ`s it is difficult to place Envotion (Stijn) in a genre. Crossing musical borders is what makes dj`ing exiting to Stijn.\r\n\r\nEnvotion already performed @ events like: Paradiso, Panama, Extrema outdoor, Impulz, DanceHill, Tribehouse, etc.\r\n\r\nHugo\r\nBack in 1987, Hugo started playing classical piano at the age of seven. \r\nIn 1994, he started working with MMEDIT, a ms-dos based music program.\r\nThis was actually what made him realise his passion for creating in\r\nstead of reproducing music. \r\n\r\nAs a consequence, in 1995 he decided to cancel piano lessons and devote\r\nmost of his time to writing and producing music. \r\n\r\nIn 1998, Hugo began studying Psychology. During this period, he not only\r\nspent time on learning about the human mind but he also got himself more\r\ninto audio and songwriting techniques. At this time, he and his brother\r\nstarted to expand their own studio. \r\nAfter four years, he succesfully completed his study and was asked to\r\nwork as a professional audio-engineer. During four months he worked on\r\nseveral commercial pop-productions. Although he enjoyed this \"full-time music\" experience,\r\nhe decided to quit when he received another job-offer in 2003. \r\n\r\nSince 2003, Hugo combines his job as psychologist with his passion for\r\nmusic. Inspired by a great diversity of musical genres, he avoids\r\nrestricting himself to one specific style.\r\nHis work ranges from lounge to progressive house, from film compositions\r\nto deep house.\r\n\r\nLaurens\r\nAt age of 12 Laurens started making music together with his brother. While \r\nexperimenting a lot with various musical genres he developed his own style \r\nand ideas about music. Beside his passion for composing, he also devoted a \r\nlot of time to the technical side of music making; sound programming was his \r\nway to create a unique vibe.\r\n\r\nIn 2002, Laurens started the study Computer Science & Knowledge Engineering. \r\nThis technical study increased his interest in sound programming even more. \r\nAs a consequence, he was often asked by other artists to give advice and \r\ncreate specific sounds and synths. Though, producing music remained his \r\nprimary goal.\r\n\r\nNowadays, Laurens is influenced by record labels like Defected, Junior and \r\nBedrock. However, his work is not restricted to one style. It varies from \r\nprogressive to funky house and is often a combination of both.\r\n\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Electronic music can be a frantic world. Countless names jostle for position on innumerable bills. More events take place in one day than anyone could hope to attend all year. Fads arrive with the inherent shelf life of yesterday’s headlines.Electronic music can be a frantic world. Countless names jostle for position on innumerable bills. More events take place in one day than anyone could hope to attend all year. Fads arrive with the inherent shelf life of yesterday’s headlines. \r\n\r\nYou have two chances to get noticed. Climb aboard the bandwagon, and adhere to whatever sound today’s tastemakers are pushing, or immerse yourself in the art form of DJing and production, focusing on crafting individualism from genres that, by nature, must conform in order to exist. Estroe chose the latter. \r\n\r\nBorn Esther Roozendaal in Holland circa 1972, a little over two and a half decades on she began taking the first steps towards a career in and around clubs, inspired by technique and technicalities, rather than glitz or glamour. As a nursing undergraduate in Amsterdam, her days spent learning contrasted a hectic five-night-a-week party diary, giving an early indication of the nocturnal profession that would follow. \r\n\r\nRegular trips to venues such as The Roxy and The It, listening to the likes of DJ Dimitri and Marcello, led to a friendship with a ‘flirtatious light-jockey’, and evenings spent watching him create atmosphere and mood with colour and visual patterns. Soon she was complaining about sluggish mixes, feeling frustrated when there was a lack of passion behind the decks, and beginning to understand how the tone could be set with melodies, drums, and basslines, rather than strobes. \r\n\r\nPutting needle to record pre-millennium, Dance Valley, Awakenings, Tresor, and FFWD soon beckoned. As too did a residency at infamous Dutch club Mazzo in 2002, where honours were shared with close friend Steve Rachmad, as Adam Beyer, Joel Mull and more headlined. Meanwhile, she was also involved in new talent night Set Off, and the experimental soiree Explicit Sounds alongside Steffi Klakson, betraying a desire to promote other artists still evident today, what with her role as judge in the Vinylized production contest, workshops at the Red Bull Music Academy, and the agency, www.estroe-advice.com, which provides training in everything from management to creating tunes. \r\n\r\nThey say the best producers started out as DJs, and this certainly rings true here. After dipping several toes into the release schedule via a host of EPs and singles- on labels such as Lessismore, Little-D, and Muzikism- 2007 saw Driven drop on Connaisseur Recordings, a track that found favour with the likes of John Digweed, along with Ellen Allien, who chose it for the Fabric.34 mix CD. Estroe’s long-awaited debut LP followed in 2009, Elemental Assets, via Connaisseur Recordings, receiving widespread critical acclaim, and featuring guest appearances from Miss Kittin and more. \r\n\r\nOf course that was then, this is now, things move fast, and in true Estroe style we must push forward. Even if that means almost forgetting to reference EPs with Vince Watson (2006’s Glasgow to Amsterdam) and Sebastian Davidson (Swabian Pancakes, 2009); sets at hotspots in her hometown, not least Club 11, Studio 80 and Gashouder; Detroit’s Movement Festival; releases on Proton Music, which led to a 2012 tour of the U.S. and Canada, and her being flown back out to North America for yet more dates after impressing the States. Oh, and the support she receives from dons Laurent Garnier, Dave Clarke, and Funk D’Void. \r\n\r\nIn 2013 Estroe resides in Rotterdam, and unveils her second LP, Comfort & Closure, on the label she now runs with Stefan ‘Terrace’ Robbers: EevoNext (descendent of the revered EevoLute Musique). A home to faces including Justin Berkovi, Art Bleek and Ian O’Donovan, the boss-woman’s own full length also nods to the imprint’s remit. A deeply textured exploration of ambience, techno, house, and electronica, it straddles dancefloors and home hi-fis, and represents both a turning point in the artist’s life and a celebration of what she has learnt up to this point. Of course on top of all this she still plays worldwide, and hosts a show on Proton Radio too. But what else do you expect from a multifarious figurehead such as this? \r\n\r\n\r\nMore info about past gigs and a full discography can be found at www.estroe.com",

However, no dance floor can hear it. The only witness to the magic he creates are the four walls of his loft until the Dutch techno legend Secret Cinema (Jeroen Verheij) finds him online.\r\nVerheij pulls Egbert out of his loft and gives him, at age 20, a stage to perform on and a record label. It turned out to be the start of an international victory tour.\r\nHaving hardly recovered from his first two releases in the Netherlands, Sven Väth calls from Frankfurt: ‘Can Egbert deliver a track for Cocoon, stat.’ Vreugdevuur becomes one of the most prominent releases of 2009 and after that things go fast. Really fast.\r\nThe loft quickly becomes history when Egbert closes the main stage of Time Warp, crushes Awakenings for no less than a dozen times in a couple years and graces Club Womb in Tokyo. Additionally, he is a frequent guest in Cape Town, Budapest, Ibiza, Melbourne and Singapore... Not bad for a guy who before his first release only flew in a plane once. But understand that wherever Egbert comes, all (let me repeat: ALL) hands will go up, and they will stay there.\r\n“Very proud of him to be the youngest Dutch techno-hero bringing quality music to dance floors across the globe” - Rocco Veenboer, Awakenings\r\nEgbert sets a new standard when he singlehandedly performs for 6 hours straight in a sold out club Melkweg in Amsterdam. The question is: what is someone who achieved so much in such a short period of time going to do next? No worries. Aside from the fact that he still has a countless amount of tracks waiting to see the world (thank you, loft), Egberts’ ambition and energy are limitless.\r\nThe entire world is his next stop.",

Starting with Tech influenced Breakbeats, he now mastered himself in creating a deep funky chunky Technogroove wich is very hard to compare to any other styles/genres. He truly has a style of his own, now started producing his own tracks and while being very comfortable behind the decks, he is a very pleasant person to work with.",

She showed her DJ personality fantastically with her fresh approach, introducing new and exciting tracks; making her one that is also very hard to leave the dancefloor for, even if you are that close to wetting yourself!..\"\r\n\r\nWords: Lila Black \r\nlink// http://uk.tilllate.com/en/news/formula-setting-new-standardsBorn in a small town in Holland, Eline became bored of bicycles, windmills and clogs, so was quickly seduced by pumping beats and heavy basslines. Thus begun her love affair with House and Techno music and eventually evolved into her experimenting with DJ-ing herself. At the young age of 16 Eline soon got noticed, and was catapulted behind the decks of one of Amsterdams biggest and most prestigious clubs, Marcanti Xtra Large. Now residing in London she has been playing various venues around the UK Tech House scene such as The Den & Centro; Home Bar; Avalon; The Egg; 54 and Platinum.",

  "artist_bio": "Fady Ferraye's sound is a deep affair, mysterious, sexy, dreamy electronic dance music, with a driving heavy tech-house beat and bass. It takes you over.DJ, producer, songwriter, label owner and event promoter Fady Ferraye has not had a normal upbringing for an artist. As a youngster growing up under the bombs of the Lebanese civil war, with access to his uncle’s vast record collection, he learned to shuttle his gigs from one shelter to another while staying in the mix. An unconventional start to a career that has heard him share his sound around the world. \r\nBased in Amsterdam for the past 7 years, his dance tracks (more than a hundred so far) have been released on labels around the Globe: Audio Therapy, Frisky, Baroque, Alterimage, Particles and Per-Vurt, to name a few. His works are regularly played by world celebrity DJs including Hernan Cattaneo, Nick Warren, Sasha, Dave Seaman, John Digweed and James Zabiela. Dimitri Andreas, Chris Fortier, Magitman, Pole Folder and Kiko are among the artists that have remixed Fady’s tracks. \r\nFady’s axis is formed by his two residencies: At legendary party scene Club NL in Amsterdam (since 2005), and at top-50 ranked club BO18 in Beirut (since 2000). From there he shuttles across Europe and the Middle East, unobtrusive, shunning the hoopla, peddling his hypnotic mix. \r\nHurly Burly is Fady’s current signature evening developed with his buddy DJ, television personality and music lover Johnny de Mol. Every second Friday of the month at Club NL since 2008, it is an unpredictable wild and moving musical evening at which any of their DJ friends come in and share the booth, like Sander Kleinenberg, Sasha, Nhar, Dimitri Nakov, Eelke Kleijn and many others. Beautiful people outside line up early just to be a part of the Hurly Burly.\r\nWhich, by the way, is also the name of Fady and Johnny’s monthly radio show on I D & T's new station 432 Radio.\r\nFady Ferraye also runs a monthly radio show, Goosebumped, on the global internet dance station Frisky Radio. Goosebumped has thousands of devoted followers and fans around the globe. \r\nThis man loves dance music. He will move your soul. The words leave off here. Take a listen. written by Gabe Marino (New York)",

Here's a short bio on top (:We won't bore you with a year by year history of how Eva Maria ended\r\nup moving the feet of house-lovers all over the world, alongside the\r\nbiggest names around and in clubs most DJ's can only dream of, as\r\nrumour and speculation are far more interesting than the truth... \r\n\r\nIn short the story is as follows. In 2004 she started struggling with\r\nrecords at home on her brand new secondhand turntables. Not her\r\nneighbours, but the local scene was applauding this fact. Inspired by\r\nBerlin and Frankfurt's music and clubs, Eva Maria focused more and\r\nmore on her DJ career alongside her party-skills.\r\n\r\nHighlights so far have included a Turkish beachtour, gigs on\r\nAwakenings (NL), Burning Man (Black Rock Desert/Nevada/USA), Arma 17\r\n(Moscow), Underground (Ibiza), Sunwaves (Mamaia), Cosmobar (London)\r\nand so on and on...  Cause of her excellent sets and her big German\r\nfanbase, clubs like Robert-Johnson (Frankfurt), Weekend and Watergate\r\n(both in Berlin) have invited her several times to play.\r\n\r\nAlso her infamous squat- and warehouse parties in Amsterdam are to\r\nthis day still talked about. Recently she decided to slow down with\r\nall those parties and spend more time in the studio. She is looking\r\nforward to her first release as well to some ultimate gigs in France,\r\nGermany, Turkey and her own beloved Holland of course. Wanna know\r\nmore? Check: evamaria.nl & wearee.nl",

As you can probably tell by now his taste in music is pretty versatile and he always finds a way to reflect this in his performances.  \r\n\r\nBeing no newcomer to the house scene, Efdé performs regularly in clubs around the Netherlands and Europe. He takes the stage either as a live act or he makes the dance-floors bounce with his energetic and ever so clever DJ sets. Efdé played at numerous major and very well known festivals and clubs like Voltt, Cargo, Source, Welcome to the Future, Studio 80, KaterHolzig and Trouw. \r\n\r\nAbsolute highlights for Efdé so far were opening for Loco Dice with a killer 4-hour set and performing at the legendary Awakenings Festival. So was his 8-hour marathon set at Studio going back to back with studio buddy Tom Ruijg (production duo TRFD), as well as playing together with him at the notorious Trouw New Years Day party ‘Trouwens’. \r\n\r\nAfter having had earlier releases on Piekup, Blabla records and Soweso Music, Efdé now feels it is time for the next step, which also includes a new musical direction. With a truckload of fresh energy and motivation there is nothing stopping Efdé from making 2014 his definite breakthrough year.",

(hmmmmz.... tnx Miguel! ;) :S )\r\nFrom that day on his softer alter-ego was Fastidioso.\r\nTogether with Danny aka Dr. Badvibes they play as Filthy Freakz\r\nIn the past they played @ for example, Latin Crush @ Club Chi, Amsterdam, and were residents @ Extravaganza @ Super Pool , Den Helder.\r\nNowadays he spins mostly solo.\r\nHis plans for the future are: getting better at producing and play a lot more \r\n",

Their skills combined resulted in a warm, electronic sound, with funk and jazz as key ingredients.\r\nThe duo knows how to take their sultry and catchy studio sound to the dance floor, accompanied by a lot of enthusiasm and passion.\r\n\r\nThe relatively young cooperation has led to performances during festivals such as Emporium, Obsession Outdoor, Matrixx at the Park and Smeerboel on the beach plus clubs like Studio 80, Doornroosje and AIR. The tracks, ‘Jazz Tango’, ‘Gotta Help’ (together with Kid Culture), ‘The Boat That Rocked’, ‘Café Latte’, ‘The Purist’ and ‘Men With Moustashes’ have opened the door to the abroad and their music is supported by internationally renowned artists Ricardo Villalobos, Loco Dice, Karotte and Luciano. Their remixes for infamous labels Yoshitoshi and Kling Klong plus the tracks as mentioned above, have placed a spotlight on the dynamic twosome within a short period of time!",

He has been in the game for over 10 years and he earned his stripes throughout these years.\r\n\r\nErik got his first mixer at the age of 14. He connected a Discman and a CD player to it and without even having a pitch, he was mixing for hours and hours. One year later, he bought 2 turntables and started spending all his money on records. He even got an extra newspaper round on top of his other one to be able to buy even more records! Later on, at the age of 17, he bought 2 Technics and it was on these decks, where he really became a skillful DJ.\r\n\r\nErik is a crowd favorite, not only because of his music, but also because of all his efforts to improve the scene. He has been hosting and organizing underground events and raves for a while now and in the mean time, Erik had several residencies (i.e. Chemistry, Fresh FM, the infamous Club Poema and more). He played all major clubs in The Netherlands and full-scale festivals like Soenda Festival, Gaasper Pleasure and ROCKIT Open Air. Besides that, he also played in Berlin, Copenhagen and London.\r\n\r\nHe gets his inspiration from music all over the world and he is not limited by any genres. It doesn’t matter if it’s hiphop, dub, reggae, house or techno. These are his influences and they characterise his sets: always a warm sound with raw bass lines.",

There, his infamous SWET nights caused long waiting lines at the door and it pushed Erick’s popularity to new heights. He frequently graced the decks at the main stages of large festivals such as ‘Dance Valley, ‘Sensation’ (international residency), ‘Mysteryland’, ‘Day At The Park’ and ‘Extrema Outdoor’. International clubs such as NOW & WOW Rotterdam, Amnesia Ibiza, Rex Paris and Catwalk Barcelona invited him repeatedly, knowing Erick would deliver a full house. \r\n\r\nWith an artistic brain and an insatiable lust for music he managed to gain success with international releases, top 10 chart positions, an impressive series of mix compilations and number 1 hit records. Now, a decade into the new century, he’s mostly known as DJ Erick E and he considers himself to be fortunate: Erick won the people’s vote and is leading the number one spot at ‘DJGuide.nl’ for the last 3 consecutive years.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, DJ performances had changed drastically and Eerdhuizen found himself longing for a different approach. A strong desire to return to a basis, founded at Club RoXY, kept growing. He craved for longer sets (‘all nighters’) and a more intimate playground, where he could perform a mix of ‘warm tech-house’ and ‘danceable techno’.\r\nThe introduction of E5H – meaning Erick E 5 Hours – gave him the chance to control the night from the first until the very last record played. He took the challenge and conquered a demanding crowd during his first E5H gigs at the ‘Amsterdam Sugar Factory, Bunker NDSM and Westerunie’. The E5H-tour visited smaller venues and popstages, playing ‘De Effenaar Eindhoven, Paard van Troje The Hague, Mezz Breda, Club Stalker Haarlem and LVC Leiden’ amongst others, successfully repeating it deep into 2011.  He played festivals such as Mysteryland, Lief and Into The Woods and was invited to perform at Undercurrent, Studio K, Pand 48, Westerunie and Studio 80.\r\nWhile setting course for the same direction in 2012, these performances also reflect his musical state of mind: Erick refined his ideas, created SMKSTF Records and put in a lot of studio hours to prepare for a string of new releases.\r\nWith less fuzz and more music, the first batch of Erick’s latest work is now officially available in a bundle, graciously titled:   ‘EERDHUIZEN - IN LOVE AGAIN’, with more energy, substance and unbridled passion on the way.\r\n\r\nSo tie your shoe laces and brace yourselves for energy, substance and unbridled passion: Erick Eerdhuizen is going back to basics!\r\n",

Besides his residency at the much acclaimed Trouw he has played venerated spots like Melkweg, Paradiso, Into the Woods, Lowlands, Studio 80, 5 Days Off, Mysteryland, Welcome To The Future, DGTL and so on…\r\n\r\n“When I make music and I play out, I have to open up my heart and be able to spread the same love that I get when I’m on the dancefloor,” he admits. “That warm feeling that hits my soul is the thing I aim for when producing my tracks or when I play in the club. Music is a highly emotive way of expressing myself, and when people recognize that I’m the happiest person on the planet.”\r\n\r\nElias released his debut EP on Tom Trago’s imprint Voyage Direct in november ’14 and there’s a whole lotta more music coming up! “People need to dance more, let themselves go” Elias says.

  "artist_bio": "Amsterdam based DJ / Producer Flow. Organiser & Booker for Club Krang parties in Amsterdam.\r\nMainly performs as Flowing, together with his partner Ingy. Please see http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj-page.aspx?id=4058DJ / Producer Flow has been into music as long as he can remember. It all started when he took piano lessons at the age of 8. He quit at age 13, but it was only three years later he heard a piano solo in a blues song and he was sold. He once again took place behind the piano, and taught himself to play the solos he heard on cds from some great blues, rock & roll, and jazz piano players like Johnny Johnson and Oscar Peterson.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Flow also taught himself how to play the bluesharp (harmonica) and he played in several bands. He performed on Jazz festivals, played in bars and even on Beal Street in Memphis.\r\n\r\nAll this time he never really listened to electronic music, but once he did, he was sold again. Still loving the raw and honest sound of the blues, he started making electronic music and soon performed as a DJ in some local bars and cafés. He was resident of some dj-cafés for two years before he moved to Amsterdam and switched styles: from funky clubhouse to minimal, techhouse, techno and house and... well, whatever rocks the dancefloor.\r\nTogether with DJ Ingy he is now also booker, promoter and resident of Club Krang, Amsterdam. Ingy and Flow also play together as a duo, called Flowing. Flowing will release their first EP, called \"the Bluesman who quit drinking\" in fall 2008.\r\n\r\nBooking agency: Piekup - www.piekup.nl",

  "artist_bio": "DJ Ingy and DJ Flow  - Flowing - play together as DJs and as a liveact (sometimes using real instruments as well as hardware and laptop). \r\n\r\nThey also run Vivid Records, their Berlin / Amsterdam based label.Flowing? Are you talking about Flow & Ingy from Amsterdam? That crazy, wild, energetic, nicely disturbed DJ couple, that's always dancing and partying with the crowd? \r\n\r\nHell yeah! \r\n\r\nIt was a magical moment in Amsterdam's club “Melkweg”, when a pretty blond girl wearing an out-of-place blouse met a drunk DJ called Flow. He poured her some vodka and kissed her in the neck. She tasted salty from all the dancing. They made out on the dance floor and rock-n-rolled all night...\r\n\r\nThe girl was named Ingy, and together they started organizing small, illegal underground parties. Flow however, was always trying to convince Ingy to start mixing as well. And finally, at a nice afterparty at his place in the winter of 2008, she was brave enough to take it on. She turned out to be very talented and to have great feeling for the music. They decided that from then on they should play together, and Flowing was born.\r\n\r\nTrue or false?\r\n\r\nIngy plays piano / keyboards, and she loves to sing. She has the voice of a 73 year old crooner who smoked 2 packs of cigarettes and drank a bottle of scotch every day of his life, so she's not your average Norah Jones. - TRUE\r\n\r\nFlow played piano and bluesharp in some jazz and blues bands and even performed live on Beale street in Memphis, Tennesee - home of the blues! - TRUE \r\n\r\nBoth having a musical background, Flow & Ingy felt like they should be doing more then just playing other peoples music. So they took on producing, and not without success. Flowing released their first EP \"The Bluesman\", with a Lauhaus remix, in June 2009 at Andre Croms brand label \"Vivid Recordings\". Played by Karotte, Derrick May, Simon Baker, Luna City Express, MEAT, and many more. It sold out in just a couple of weeks. Since July 2010, Flowing manages the Vivid label – TRUE \r\n\r\nIngy practised ballet for 12 years, so she knows her moves. One time, during a set, she jumped out of the DJ booth right on top of the huge woofer and danced with the crowd... she mixed in the next track from the wrong side of the booth and just continued dancing, and the people (especially the guys) loved it. - TRUE\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of May 2008, Flow & Ingy married and officially became Flowing. It was a beautiful day and an amazing “Berlin roaring 20's style” dinner and party in in the famous bar-restaurant-club 11 (RIP) in Amsterdam. – TRUE!\r\n\r\nAt the “Gouden Kabouter Awards 2010” (the Dutch “Oscars for the dance scene”) Flowing was nominated for best DJ duo and Ingy won the award for “Most Sexy DJ” -TRUE! \r\n\r\nFlowing adopted two party parrots, a boy and a girl, who always travel with them. The parrots are totally crazy, and dance to the music all night long. After a couple of vodka shots they scream of pleasure: WRAAH! - TRUE\r\n\r\nFlowing organizes the Club Krang parties in Amsterdam, with people like Julietta, Livio & Roby, Nick Curly, Polder, MEAT, Mike Huckaby, Andre Crom, Plattenpeter, Junction SM, and many many more. - TRUE\r\n\r\nAt their infamous afterparties, Flowing sometimes do crazy livesets in which they sing and use real instruments. No more information about this can be given, but if you ask the right people... you might get to know more or even see a video! - TRUE\r\n\r\nWith their typical groovy, deep but always funky sound, Flowing already rocked dancefloors all over Europe and beyond. At Thaibreak, Harry Klein in Munich, U60311 in Frankfurt, Paradiso in Amsterdam, Arena Club / Glasshaus, Club der Visionaere, Bar 25, Golden Gate, Horst and Tape in Berlin, Welcome to the Future Festival 2009, Summerwave Festival 2009.... and the list goes on. Ofcourse you can find them most often in their favourite club, Studio 80 in Amsterdam where they are residents of the “24 hour party people” parties. In 2010 they will continue creating dancefloor mayhem all over the globe – TRUE!\r\n\r\nFlowing on Myspace: http://www.myspace.com/flowingdjlive\r\n\r\nFlowing Resident Advisor: http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/flowing\r\n\r\nFlowing Soundcloud: http://soundcloud.com/flowing\r\n\r\nFlowing Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/go.with.the.flowing\r\n\r\nFlowing Bandpage: http://listn.to/flowing",

He lives for music 24 hours a day. Producing, recording, spinning, selling and above all, loving music is what keeps him busy. There is no past, only future and Gideon is setting the standard higher and higher with his ever-evolving productions.\r\n\r\nIn a few years he built up an impressive discography with over a 100 released tracks under his different alter egos Gideon, The Economist and Alexis Tyrel. Early 2008 he released some tracks on big international record labels such as Kanzleramt (Berlin) and Sino (Hong Kong) followed by a complete artist album on both labels. On Kanzleramt he released his “Need No Permission” album in October 2008. Now 2009 he is the driving force within a Dutch label collective called Homedistribution, under his new company he manages 14 labels.\r\n\r\nHis debut and conceptual album NoNameNoFaceNoNumber was already released on his own label Lessismorecordings in 2007, where he showed a new approach to dubby techno and sequential composition. Running Lessismorecordings and labels like Grayarea, Anticlub and Minimalplus is one of his favourite occupations.\r\n\r\nGideon Alexis Tyrel Hommes was born in 1980 in the city of technology where Philips made the first steps in electronic music composition. In 1990 Gideon had his first contact with underground electronic music and has been hooked ever since. Spinning records and producing have been keeping him busy for more than a decade. So we can easily say that, he is not only an innovative and a differentiating producer of electronic music who runs his own label, he is also an experienced and very skilled DJ. In other words he is the full package of a modern artist.\r\n\r\nThe DJ sets he plays under his own name Gideon are techno oriented and memorable for playing the new unreleased material and things to come from the several labels he runs and supports. He combines the expected with the unexpected, monotone grooves with melodic revelations, rawness with sophistication and modern minimalism with old school renaissance. Contradiction? He does not think so. Gideon gives you a new vision on the full techno spectrum; he incorporates his love for the old days with his vision on the things to come.\r\nHe already played impressive venues like: Bergain/Ostgut (Berlin), Tresor (Berlin), Flex (Vianna), Arm17 (Moscow), One (Mardid), Awakenings Festival (Holland), Extrema Outdoor Festival (Holland) and more\r\n\r\nwww.anticlub.com\r\nwww.homedistribution.nl\r\nwww.minimalplus.com\r\nwww.lessismorecordings.com",

Being a full-time producer since 1991 Ferry has developed into a true prodigy of the international dance scene.\r\n\r\nAfter initially producing some hardcore gabba tracks Ferry became more interested in clubhouse and trance. In 1996 Ferry achieved a position in the U.K. single chart at #46 with ‘Don’t be Afraid’ by Moonman, his first major and European breakthrough as a solo dance Artist, producer & composer.\r\n\r\nIn 1997 Ferry and his partner Robert Smit established the Tsunami dance label together with the Dutch based dance company Purple Eye Entertainment b.v.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration would prove to be an almost instant success and eventually resulted in the creation of one of the most influential dance labels around today. These three parties have set up in the meantime a new label called Polar State.\r\n\r\nIn February 1999 Ferry’s second solo project, system F, was released on the Tsunami imprint. The title ‘Out Of The Blue’ is a melodic and powerful twister and turned out to be one of the biggest trance track of 1999, achieved a top twenty position in the U.K. single chart and put Ferry on the world-wide dance map permanently.\r\n\r\nOther projects of Ferry Corsten are: “Carte Blanche” by Veracocha (produced together with Vincent de Moor) and in May 1999 the title “Gouryella” by the act Gouryella was released, an Artist-project Ferry produces together with the famous Dutch DJ Tiësto.

In his quest, he has gained not only respect in the music industry he has built around him but in similar musical genres as well.\r\n\r\nFerry had always been interested in music as a child.

He then embarked on a live act performance with a friend and won his first award \"De Grote Prijs van Nederland\" Holland in 1989.  He eventually released a record with a couple of friends when he was just sixteen years old and has evolved into releasing self-made productions. To this date, Ferry produces and engineers all his musical productions and compilations.\r\n\r\nAfter initially producing some underground club tracks Ferry became more interested in clubhouse and trance. In 1996 Ferry achieved his first chart position in the UK single chart at #46 with 'Don't be Afraid' by Moonman, his first major and European breakthrough as a solo dance Artist, producer and composer.\r\n\r\nSince Then, Ferry Corsten is the only electronic dance music artist to achieve the highest number of dance singles in the UK charts and currently has 10 gold singles in his studio.\r\n\r\nThrough the success of his production skills, he has also produced the Japanese Popstar, Ayumi Hamasaki's single \"Connected\" in her latest album, which has sold 4 million albums to date. (2003).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, he has been nominated and has a won numerous awards in the past few years. Ferry Corsten has been elected as 'Producer of the Year' during the Ericsson Muzik Awards in London (1999), leaving fellow-nominees like Puff Daddy and Rodney Jerkins behind him.

He is nominated in this year's (2004) Winter Miami Music Conference for best International Dj and Best Compilation (Ferry Corsten: Mixed Live) and Best National DJ and Best Video (Rock Your Body Rock) for the TMF (Dutch MTV) Awards in the Netherlands (2004).\r\n\r\nAside from producing, Ferry began compiling and mixing the Trance Nation (1999-2001) series together with Ministry of Sound which has sold over a million copies worldwide.\r\n\r\nIt was there and then when Ferry began hitting the streets (all over the world) with his record bag to spread his unique sound of trance music.  In the same year he entered the DJ charts in England (1999) and has been a consistent name on the list ever since.  He is currently listed at number 5 on UK's DJ magazine (2004) and number 4 on America's BPM magazine (2004). Since then, he's consistently traveled around the Europe, America, and Asia every year averaging about 130 performances around the globe with concentrations on America, Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\n2004 is a culmination of his work as a producing artist and dj. The launch of his artist album \"Ferry Corsten: Right of Way\" at the Heineken Musical Hall (Netherlands2003) where 4,500 clubbers came to be with Ferry in a special 8 hour set, in The Netherlands is a testament to his goal in combining his artistic skills as a producer and a DJ on an international scale.\r\nFrom this album, hit singles such as It's Time, Punk and Rock your Body Rock have been released. \"Rock Your Body Rock\" debuted on number 11 on the UK Charts (February 2004).  Remixes of this single were made by Moby and Renee Pilgrim.\r\n\r\nAside from the release of his artist album, 2004 has brought the release of compilations such as Dance Valley's 10th year anniversary and first of the series Euphoria Infinite.

He first emerged at the age of 17 with learned sets that were as influenced by classical music as they were jazz and science fiction. Now, years later, his profile is beginning to rise around Europe having played alongside influential DJs like Zip, Rhadoo and Onur Ozer at clubs like Studio 80 and Paradiso in the Netherlands, as well as at places like Salon Zur Wilden Renate and Club der Visionäre in Berlin.\r\n\r\nHis sets wave together intricate rhythms, plenty of mood and never fail to work a dancefloor. Unsurprisingly given that he is an Audio Engineer graduate, so too does Ferro produce his own music. So far coming on labels like Moscow Records, Tzinah and Karton, he is fast fomenting his own signature sound. It is a sound that comes caked in a vintage dust, sounding as though his beats have been maturing in a draw before being unleashed on the world.  \r\n\r\nThey are organic, warm and inviting, and it is Ferro’s lasting goal to make all of his music using genuine hardware and fully analogue tools.  So too does he hope to collaborate with similarly minded musicians in future, at the same time as forging ahead with his own unique sonic identity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor bookings:\r\n\r\ndaniel@meanwhile.nl",

In 1996 he started his first own record label called “Roxy’s”. This was named after the dance hall where he was the resident DJ at that time. In 1997 more labels were added, such as: “7Club” and “Play Records”. Besides having all these labels, ClubJock Fred Henderson continued doing gigs at many famous clubs, such as: “Barocca” and “Club Tropicana” in Rotterdam, “Escape” and “Crazyland” in Amsterdam. All these hot spot were whisked away by his beats. Around the year 2000 he started to focus all of his activities towards producing and releasing various dance and house tracks. Fred Henderson's productions were released on labels, such as: “R&S” in the UK, “Essential”, “Blue records”, “Untidy” , “Private” and “Outland”.

It was spotted and used by DJ’s such as: Pete Thong, Johan Gielen, Klubheads, Mark van Dale, Roog, Kev Hill, Peter Gelderblom, José, Peran and Jean who praised the track on his show on Radio538. Dennis Verheugd (also Radio 538) used the track for his infamous “Powermix”. ClubJock was invited to come over to DeepFm, FreshFM as well as 3FM (Dutch National Radio Stations), where he would get a full hour of airplay. He blew the roof off with his favourites and of course his own productions.

He has worked with Cubase and ILogic (Apple), Final Scratch, and several brand names of mixers and CD-decks, and all of this can always be controlled by one laptop. So: a technical bright spark!

After a remix on Positiva Records (UK), a brandnew EP on 90watts (NL) and lots of bookings he's ready to rock with his mix of deep/tech house.When DJ/Producer Franklin Reeves (1983) got notice of housemusic in 1993, he was immediately caught by the virus. \r\nInspired by the early days of house and the famous Roxy club Franklin decided it was time to control the decks himself. \r\n \r\nAfter his first gig in front of a big crowd (RedBull Full Moon Party) it all went upwards for him.\r\n \r\nSoon he played at parties like Dance Valley, Exrema, Mysterland and later at This is..(Sander Kleinenberg), Festival Lief and in clubs like Paradiso, Escape, Studio 80, Hotel Arena and Now&Wow. He also flew to Sweden (Jonkoping) and Turkey (Bodrum) to do more gigs.\r\n \r\nFranklin developed his style from funky house back then to a unique style of rolling deep/techhouse nowadays, as long as the groove is there! Always ready to please the crowd with the finest tunes.\r\n \r\nNowadays he is also producing his own music. And with success. Several tracks of him were played on national and international radio (Dance Department, BBC 1).\r\nA few years ago he met Jeroen van Meeteren and Bart Heideman from 90Watts Records and soon he developed his own techy style which fitted perfectly on this Amsterdam based label.\r\n \r\nAlways inspired by the early clubscene from the 90's he's making deep-house and tech-house which receive many good respones from DJ´s like Paul Hamill, Chris Boshell, Mr. Jones, Tim Andresen, Nick K, Dennis Ruyer, James Nidecker, Lin, Marcella and Angelo D'Onorio.\r\n \r\nThis year his tracks Crunch, Down the Drain and Futurism were released on 90Watts Records. A brand new EP is coming up for that same label and Franklin will also release tracks on Strom Recordings, the label of James Nidecker (NL)",

It was somewhere in 2010 that the two started off by making mixes of earlier work. Using this practice as an exploration of the possibilities of their combined skill set. While molding their sounds, they slowly drifted to place filled with organic sounds, sounds from real instruments, people talking in the brackground, a lost African choir and obviously the occasional empty beer bottle. Hit with a stick. Twisting these sounds in submission by using plain techno beats, raw bass lines and sometimes a hint of jazz. These combined soundscapes were the foundation for the sound they have now. The sound of Formel.",

After constantly proving their quality to the public and organizations they earned residency’s at some very popular Amsterdam based events as WTTF, Voidd and Minimaal Feestmaal. They also got invited for famous festivals as the Welcome to the future festival, playing next to artists like Luciano, the Mountain People and Luna City Express.\r\n\r\nNext to their musical performances they organize different events at popular clubs like Studio-80 and the Flexbar, based in Amsterdam. With the bookings of artists as Brother’s Vibe, Luna City Express, Seuil and Baaz they’re giving a housey touch to the Dutch party scene.\r\n\r\nBesides playing music and organizing events, their always busy with making different styles of music that totally satisfies their musical needs at that moment in a song. 2009 will be the year that their specific sound goes public, so expect music with a lot of different influences, based on different moods and thoughts of two young people, living in a world existing of music…\r\n",

Electronic circuits and noise making machines were their next project, until music production became a real possibility.\r\n\r\nDaniel started producing dance music under the name 3 Colours and has been using his own name for a few years now, while continuing to teach sound design in Amsterdam, and Hans makes music as Junktion; but their childhood days brought them to collaborating in the studio and the Fouk project was born.\r\n\r\nTheir first vinyl release as Fouk, on their new label Outplay was met with critical acclaim with brilliant reactions to ‘Stuff Your Dad Liked’ and ‘Cat Lady’. Following swiftly on, they produced a formidable remix for Lay-Far on the Swedish Local Talk Records.",

His music has a certain sense of value, often combining the organic with the sonical abstract. Having studied Sonology at the Royal Conservatory in The Hague for several years, he has been and still is experimenting with analog and digital studio techniques by making mutiple channels compositions. As Frank Hagemans, his real name, focus lies on concrete music, also seen as sound art.\r\n\r\nHaag's history takes us back to the south of Holland where he grew up with his two elder brothers and sister. Coming from a family that is very involved in classical and jazz music, harmony and funk is automatically embedded in his roots. Through his older siblings Motown and over-produced `80 bands like Toto became his favourite listenings. Michael Jackson impressions were a daily routine. As a bass player, he played various gigs around the south of holland in the midst of the 90's grunge movement. When not rehearsing with a band, Frank's musical curiosity continued.\r\nProbably as a result of being used to hearing so much acoustic and \"humanly\" composed music,  he became more and more consumed by the machine made and electronic sounds of house, techno and IDM. \r\n",

Being surrounded by the records he loved gave him an insight to the dance music industry as well as keen sense of how music moved people, and he quickly became a A&R manager; working at the heart of the burgeoning Dutch scene.\r\nThrough years of hard work DJ-ing and producing, Funkerman established himself internationally, and by 2004 he decided it was time to capitalise on his success, so he founded Flamingo Recordings, with fellow producer Raf and DJ/producer Fedde le Grand. \r\nIn the six years since, the label has gone from strength to strength, releasing some of the biggest house tracks of recent times, like Funkerman’s ‘Speed Up’ , Ida Corr’s ‘Let me think about it’, Fedde le Grand’s ‘Put Your Hands Up For Detroit’ and their collaboration on ‘3 Minutes To Explain’.\r\nFlamingo Recordings has of course also been the outlet for his own prolific discography. In 2005 Funkerman topped the Dutch club charts with ‘Rule the Night’ and ‘The One’, with the latter getting support from leading DJ’s worldwide and appearing on numerous compilations.\r\nThen in 2007 he made the Dutch Top 40, the Mega Single Top 100 and the Mega Top 50 in a collaboration with Fedde le Grand, under their F to the F alias, with ‘Wheels In Motion’. In the same year he also made the international charts with the massive ‘Speed Up’ featuring I/Fan, a track so popular it was released by another nine labels before eventually being signed by legendary UK label Defected Records.\r\nIn 2008 he again teamed up with Fedde again to release ‘3 Minutes To Explain’, as well as delivering several huge remixes for the likes of Ida Corr, Guru Josh and the Sugababes, as well as turning hits like Re-United’s \r\n\r\n\r\n‘Sun Is Shining’ and Jaimy & Kenny D’s ‘Keep On Touchin Me’ into new club anthems. And as further proof of his commercial success, ‘Speed Up’ was made available as a downloadable track on the Xbox 360 karaoke game, Lips.\r\nOff the back of an extensive North American and Australian tour, 2009 saw him release ‘Remember’ again featuring I-Fan, which dominated the download charts, as well as YouTube, thanks to the beautifully sinister animated video. He also invested in the ever-growing reputation of the label by starting the Flamingo Nights series of parties, which soon became an international benchmark for world-class production and quality guest mixes.\r\nThis year sees the long-awaited debut artist album from Funkerman, along with a production and DJ’ing schedule that perfectly displays his broad attitude to music, playing a diverse mix of the world’s best festivals and clubs, and working with artists varying from soul and hip-hop to underground house and electro. \r\nWhilst enjoying the many fruits of his labour, Funkerman’s aim is to keep on improving musically and, as always, to try and push electronic music to the next level.\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "From Nirvana’s grunge and punky rock from the Peppers; with Changes of Life thanks to Jeff Mills; to groovy grooves with long breaks and mean basslines.As a kid, Freddie's musical interests lay with Nirvana’s grunge and the more punky rock from the Peppers. Especially the groovy bass-lines played by Flea had a major impact on his emerging musical taste. When he grew older his tastes changed with him; from guitar riffs via hard style, to techno. From the moment he heard Changes of Life, an old school minimal record by Jeff Mills, he was hooked on techno and he hasn´t looked back since. He borrowed his first decks from a friend and started buying vinyl.\r\n\r\nSince then he has developed a nose for groovy new tracks. Combined with his technical skill, this allows him to constantly expand his horizon and let his inspiration guide him to new levels of groove. Though his sound is still evolving, there are certain traits that characterize his style. Rolling grooves, long breaks and mean bass lines. But whatever tag you put on his style, when you place him on stage, he will fill the room to the broom with a constant flow of energy and beats (not necessarily in that order).",

  "artist_bio": "With such a strong work ethic and a desire to broaden his scope across the world, you get the feeling that his aims for global domination are very much within his grasp. As is clear from his decision to veer away from the more hyperbolic sounds of his contemporaries though, he won’t be compromising his ethos to do so.Franky Rizardo’s hugely refreshing approach to house music has been paying dividends in a big way.\r\n\r\nHaving established himself as one of the biggest draws in Holland’s house music circuit with a style that works as well on big stages as it does in sweaty clubs, he’s now rapidly expanding his horizons across the world. Releases on OFF, Defected and Spinnin’ demonstrate an increasingly strong production career, while his Flow radio show and events are fast becoming a major part of the house music landscape across the world.\r\n\r\n“I think that playing a lot of different stages has taught me how to work with a large diversity of crowd, rather than doing one trick every show. I don’t want to be a one-trick pony. I just want to arrive and do my set specifically for that night.” It speaks volumes about his appeal and ambition that he’s as at home playing with long-time friend Hardwell as he is playing alongside house music legends like MK and Dennis Ferrer. \r\n\r\nA decision to dedicate himself to the modern deep house sound in recent times stemmed from a desire to stop his style from snowballing to the OTT builds and drops that his main stage and big room performances were pushing him towards. \"I was performing on the big stages and I thought, I’m really enjoying the big crowd, but I’m really not enjoying being pressured towards a certain sound. So I thought to myself - how can I bring my house sound to these crowds?\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, his Flow radio show on Holland’s national station SLAM!FM was one of the first in the country to push the deep house sound, slotting him in between Sander Van Doorn and Nicky Romero’s shows. Its success has now spawned a stage at festivals including Dance Valley and Free Your Mind, and Franky has big plans for his burgeoning brand. \"We have a lot of interest from a lot of big festivals, and we now have the radio show on Sirius XM in the US, and I’m really working together with the whole team to make this all happen. We are also creating a talent pool who will join Flow including an agency and a label.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of new music, things are looking incredibly healthy for Franky on the production front too. Since his OFF Recordings EP hit Beatport’s Deep House Top 25, he’s been working manically on a slew of new tracks - including four new tracks and 6 new remixes for his Deep Down & Defected compilation. He makes snappy house music, full of character and attitude and wrapped up in crisp, punchy production. His tracks find the perfect balance between underground groove and accessible hook, serving as a neat microcosm of his position in the DJing spectrum. \r\n\r\n“I think house is in a really healthy place” he says when probed on his overview of the scene at large. “The whole house sound is coming back. It creates a lot of room for producers to really make the music they love, and I see that more and more with my colleagues.\" \r\n\r\nIt’s a relief to hear that artists like Rizardo are committed to sticking to what they’re passionate about. If mainstream success follows, then so be it; but he’s not going to chase it at the cost of his integrity. \r\n\r\nAn insanely busy DJing schedule already sees him playing up to 70 gigs in the space of two months, covering a huge range of parties and venues. Frequent gigs in Ibiza (Hardwell asked Franky to play his nights at Ushuaia in recognition of house coming back into the spotlight) and closing the Defected stage at WEAREFSTVL are cited amongst his highlights. This bustling diary is testament to the passion and commitment he pours into his sets. For years he’s been re-editing other artists’ tracks to give himself a slew of exclusive material, and his love for his craft when he’s behind the decks is clear for all to see. \r\n\r\nWith such a strong work ethic and a desire to broaden his scope across the world, you get the feeling that his aims for global domination are very much within his grasp. As is clear from his decision to veer away from the more hyperbolic sounds of his contemporaries though, he won’t be compromising his ethos to do so. \r\n\r\nLook out for Franky Rizardo ‘Deep Down And Defected 7’, featuring his remixes of classics by Sandy Rivera, Pete Tong and Copyright, plus four exclusive new original productions.\r\n\r\nWords: Ben Gomori",

With a strong eye for detail, her deep grooves are surely going to make you move. Her first track 'Radioactive Elephants From Mars \"was immediately in the Beatport Top 100. Gabriela consistently delivers glorious techno mixes that demonstrate her excellent technical skills as well as her ability to engage the audience. There are gentle moments elegantly timed in the center, and exotic signatures laced throughout the entire mix. These traits balance well with the explosive peaks and climax that convincingly send you off into a night of amorous robots, majestic caverns, and colorful denizens. It is a landscape we will look forward to visiting again and again.",

  "artist_bio": "Francesco Pico’s name is often heard in the dance scene. He released and remixed numerous tracks for labels such as Global Underground, AudioTherapy, Urbantorque, Extrema, Briquerouge and his own label Magnitude Recordings. His tracks are played by Sasha, Jimmy v M, Laurant Garnier, just to name a few. As a dj, he worked throughout the country and is still regularly booked to play in clubs all over Holland an increasingly in other countries. Francesco can be heard frequently on Proton Radio, Fresh FM and on 3FM.Francesco Pico has always been fascinated by music with a story. The feeling at the end is determined by the beginning and the further structure of his music set. Separate sounds on themselves may sound insignificant, but put together in the right order they become so meaningful, it is capable of releasing your deepest emotions. A feeling that simply cannot be described. Just be patient and you will be rewarded. That’s the beauty of his music.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly why it is hard to talk about a certain Francesco Pico style. Everything goes as long as that certain emotional feeling is achieved. Francesco has a very recognisable groove and vibe, and he also has the ability to let the music roam freely, always trying to tell his story. In the end, Francesco is always capable of creating a danceable vibe. Place and setting are always a fact a deejay should be aware of. Francesco knows like no other how to adapt to these circumstances, and is continuously working hard to adjust his groove and style in order to give the crowd his distinctive thrilling and stimulating mix.\r\n\r\nFrancesco has been working in the dance scene since 1991. Before that, music has always been a significant part of his life. He gets his inspiration from artists like Mike Oldfield, Camel, Junkie XL, Sasha, Gorillaz, UNKLE, Danny Tenaglia, Remy, Chris Duckenfield and more. He already managed to make a name by releasing quite a lot of his own productions. He has also remixed numerous productions, so it is fair to say his work is quite impressive. His productions and remixes have been released by labels like: Global Underground, Audio Therapy, Urbantorque, Manual music, Extrema music, Odori (swag), Killbrique (David Duriez), Good:as, Onestar and his own label: Magnitude Recordings. His releases were admitted in the play list of many famous deejays, and reviews in several magazines were very positive on his work. In 2007, Francesco launched his very first artist album “Imagining Sounds”. Its first single “All by yourself” was a huge success. His biggest supporter of this track was dj Sasha. The world-renowned dj used “All by yourself” in his Essential mix, which was broadcasted in August from Ibiza’s “Amnesia”. The track has also been used as closing track on Jimmy van M’s “Balance 10.1” album.\r\n\r\nBut all this is not yet enough for Francesco. He still produces a lot and has been picked up by the world famous British label “Global Underground”. A few tracks and remixes have already been released on albums like GU:MIXED2 and Electric Calm 4 but also as single on the GU:Music label. Also Dave Seaman showed interest in Francesco and has asked him to make a remix for his label “Audio Therapy”.\r\n\r\nwww.francescopico.nl\r\n\r\nwww.myspace.com/francescopico1\r\n\r\nwww.earthbookings.nl\r\n\r\n",

Their releases and signature \"Bashups\" are regular features in live playlists and podcasts of the biggest and most influential Electronic Dance Music performers across the globe.\r\nWith founder, Sander van Dien at the production heart of the duo, and renown DJ and Producer Shane Halcon added to the equation, the combined forces behind the First State duo will be elevating the name to the next level. First State are famous for multiple chart-topping hits like \"Maze\" , \"Skies on Fire\", \"My Sanctuary\" and many more.\r\nTheir initial claim to fame was the track \"Falling\", that featured on Tiesto's \"In Search Of Sunrise\" compilation. This led to the duo making their debut performance ahead of Tiesto in Amsterdam in 2006, which subsequently led to a complete European tour that included a headlining set at Privilege in Ibiza, and another event that saw First State perform as the first ever DJ act at the O2 Arena in London. This set the duo up for a fast and steady rise in the Electronic Dance world.\r\nWith two hugely talented DJs and Producers at the helm, First State are an uniquely diverse and dynamic pair that are as at home in the studio as they are behind the decks. The past 2 years have been   groundbreaking for  First State as both artists progressed to new heights individually and collectively, with performances at significant events such as Miami Music Week, A State Of Trance 500 (Den Bosch) & 550 (Moscow), The Official Istanbul Formula 1 Grand Prix Pre-Party, The Gallery at Ministry Of Sound, Privilege Ibiza, Monday Bar Cruise, Kazantip, and lengthy tours to Asia, Southern Africa, Scandinavia and North America, and topping it off with a monthly residency at one of Ibiza’s most famous clubs, Es Paradis. \r\nWith an array of ammunition out of their Netherlands headquarters, which range from albums and compilations, to chart-topping hit singles and massive remixes and , to a weekly radio show spanning across a multitude of broadcast stations with tens of thousands of weekly listeners, there aren't many EDM fans that haven't heard the name \"FIRST STATE\".\r\nBookings: tom@integrityam.com  Press: ana@firststatemusic.com\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Since the late nineties Fokko started DJ'ing and producing music, and developed his own style that fits somewhere between techno, minimal and house. In 2008 his career as both dj and porducer took off, producing and remixing for labels like Outland Records, Strom Recordings, Suara, SK Supreme, Crazy Toys, Minimind, 68 Recordings and Monocline. His tracks are supported by artists like Paco Osuna, Marco Carola, Benny Rodrigues, Bart Skils, Dave Ellesmere, Joris Voorn, Edwin Oosterwal, Nuno dos Santos, Warren Fellow, Massi DL, Karotte, Valentino Kanzyani, Warren Fellow, Joseph Capriati, Ilario Alicante, 2000 and One and Adam Beyer. Doing his live-set and deejaying together with Koen Lebens brought him to perform at big events like Cocoon Goes Amsterdam and Dirty Dutch, while also playing the..Fokko Versloot was born in 1982 in Leiderdorp, one of the most notorious cities of the Dutch 'polder'. One year later, in 1983, his parents decided that their hometown, the suburban ghetto of Zoeterwoude, was too dangerous to raise their family and migrated to the far north. They settled in Sneek, Friesland, and stayed there more than seven successive years. By 1990 they had realized there was no other option than to return to the region where they originally came from and moved to Leiden, city of Rembrandt van Rijn, Jan Steen, Pablo Picasso and many other internationally respected troubadours. Fokko lived in the centre of Leiden-city for more than 15 years, next to an award-winning Chinese restaurant. Currently he is living in Rotterdam.\r\n\r\nSince the late nineties Fokko started DJ'ing and producing music, and developed his own style. Nowadays, his music ranges from electronic-inspired, soul-infused tech-house to floorpounding, funking techno and everything in between. More experienced and battle-hardened listeners will hear a twist of ambient gospel too. Influenced by various styles and artists, Fokko's musical vision can be described as both intelligent and deep as energetic and powerful.\r\n\r\nSince 2007 Fokko started to focus more and more on creating his own music. In april 2008 his first EP was released at the infamous Outland Records, based in Amsterdam. This EP contained the tracks 'Circus' (made together with Koen Lebens) and 'Repeat'. Both tracks received massive support and were played by artists like Paco Osuna, Marco Carola, Benny Rodrigues, Bart Skils, Dave Ellesmere, Joris Voorn, Edwin Oosterwal, Nuno dos Santos, Warren Fellow, Juan Sanchez, Massi DL and many more. In the summer of 2008 Fokko's remix of Koen Lebens - Napolitanzer was picked up by Karotte, Valentino Kanzyani (it was in his May chart), Warren Fellow, Joseph Capriati, James Nidecker, Adam Beyer and lots of other big names. At the end of 2008 various successful remixes were released. Currently, Fokko is working on various new productions, such as a new EP for Outland Records and a couple of remix-projects.

His album Producers Mind (2011) is a showcase of versatility and recent monster hits such as 'Halos' and 'I'm The Melodyman' are direct proof of his skills to both feel and surprise his fans. And while he normally makes his appearance high above the crowd, on just about every known mainstage, he is very much ‘one of the guys’.\r\n\r\nThis fueled thoughts for his 2012 campaign where he experiments with crowd fueled participation into his music, events and artist career. ‘For The People’ has that socialist charm while actually offering his fans and music enthusiast alike a chance to participate in his work as an artist and to even get something in return.\r\n\r\nFrontliner’s career has been marked with success since he started in 2006, when he (at that time known as ‘Abject’) and Headhunterz joined forces to create two instant hits; Scantraxx Rootz (2006) and End of my Existence (2006). From there he build on an impressive discography both as a solo artist and together with various fellow artists who were happy to work with his creative approach. ‘Spacer’ eventually became the most played hardstyle track of 2008 and can still be considered one of the most popular tracks in the genre today.\r\n\r\nIt didn't came as a big suprise that in the beginning of 2012 Frontliner launched his own recordlabel 'Keep It Up music' which with releases as Phaseriffic and Keep It Up proves to become a well known brand within the scene.\r\n\r\nAnthem wise Frontliner has become a popular name: ‘Save Exit Planet’ was the last In Qontrol anthem, ‘Call Of The Visionary’ the theme for Reverze in 2011, ‘Never Come Down’ is the title of the 2012 edition of Emporium Festival, 'Symbols' gave a new meaning to Q-base 2012 and his track with Max Enforcer ‘On The Go’ became an anthem on itself. And with al this firework in recent years the magic word for the future can be easily guessed:\r\n“music.”",

Partially by his musical background (trumpet and piano), he had an interest in how these house tracks came to be. This interest lead him to create a sound which is best specified as a euphoric blend of musicality and depth.\r\n \r\nWhat all started with simple producing programs such as Ejay and Music Maker has now become a ‘professional hobby’ with a summer 2009 release on Noir Music. The track ‘My friend is a cloud’ is a co-production of Sebastian Davidson and Freak Strano and has been a positive boost to more releases on the dutch \"Klopfgeist\" label (such as 'Buttefly Effect EP' and 'The Escape EP'). As one of Groningen’s regularly seen DJ’s, Freak Strano is now known for his melancholic sound which varies from deephouse to hints of progressive with a profound emphasis on organic sounds. \r\n\r\nSo, is Freek Wigbold a techno DJ trapped in a deep house DJ's body? Maybe so, but once you get over the initial shock of this melancholic producer playing such physical cuts, you've given into the jacking impulse enough to realize that Freak Strano's productions and his favorite tracks to spin are both deeply emotional and full on physical. One's just a bit better for partying—something that Freek knows well.",

He tries to maintain the old “vinyl feel” in his sets mixing long transitions and looping as little as possible while using a Maschine to add his own sound. Combine that with an external delay and you have more than just a regular “DJ set”.\r\n\r\nGloom also is one of the forces behind Compound Music, THE upcoming techno organisation in Amsterdam. Which as of September 2012 will host their techno parties at Studio80.\r\n\r\nWith recent gigs at Compound, Secret Garden Festival, Iamtechno, Chateau Techno, Lazy Sundays & Collective d'Amsterdam; Gloom has already made an impact in 2012.\r\n\r\nFirst release scheduled for 2013",

  "artist_bio": "KBM & Maxito are Grey Area. Two producers focussed on combining a variety of dance music in our harmonic, deep and driving performances and productions.\r\n\r\nFor all inquiries please email: mgmt@garniche.nlWe are very happy to present our new artist project, inspired by the grey areas in our lives, surroundings and music. However our lives before the start of our aspiring musical career have been a bit of a blur. We have tried to explain how our musical personalities have evolved but it has quite frankly been very confusing for us as well, we’re both not quite sure how it all happened. But let’s face it, asking the people who helped/inspired and influenced us will be your best bet on finding out the truth behind all of this. \r\n\r\nIt all started when Max was visiting a local barmitswa to gain inspiration for his Hebrew inspired instrumental Shofar album called “Hope You’re Old Enough to Blow My Horn or “Have You Ever Tasted a Horn’s End?”. Max was abducted by a middle-aged Jewish vegetarian hipster who dragged him to the now oh so fashionable area of Williamsburg Brooklyn in New York City, where she allegedly held him captive in a former nursery to produce her offspring.\r\n\r\nDuring that time Jay was working as a water slide tester for a local amusement park, which gave him the luminous idea to start a sanctuary for the so called “theme-park generation”. A generation of kids who are unfamiliar with the responsibilities involved when participating in modern day society.\r\nUnfortunately for Jay his subjects turned out to be more disciplined than he had initially anticipated which caused Jay himself to become a bit of a mischief. He quit his job and locked himself in London’s infamous ‘Fabric’ nightclub to see what all this fuss was about  We’re not quite sure what happened there and whether this was part of the reason why the famous nightclub had a bit of financial setback in 2010. Oh well, let’s continue.\r\n\r\nWhen Max finally managed to escape the hands of his female assailant, he jumped on a plane back to Europe. Rumors suggest he was invited on the private jet of a couple of legendary DJs in return for playing them a marathon ‘Sky Hi’ DJ set of 6 hours. He convinced them to fly to London’s Heathrow airport before they continued on to Ibiza (or was it Miami?) Anyway, this is where he found his mate Jay lying on one of the couches humming an amazing melody he probably picked up during his inspiring but most of all tiring clubbing days/weeks/months/years (who knows???). \r\n\r\nThe rest is history, in terms of tracing back those elements which gave the duo their success, it comes down to rather a catchy formula which they took from an educational YouTube-video of a certain producer who looked a lot like the resurrection of Freddy Mercury .They decided to experiment with this idea. After blending some drum-loops and bass-tunes with just the right amount of reverb and delay, the duo reached their desirable result and felt more than comfortable presenting their ingenious sculpted masterpieces to the public. Their epiphany seemed like an act of G.O.D.  \r\n\r\nDon’t we all love the Good Old Days.",

Recently he released his solo debut on the Greek Echovolt records as well.

  "artist_bio": "DJ, Producer, Labelmanager, Music Lover and only at the age of 22… Let us present to you: Hardwell! A boy who takes his love for house music very serious, is step by step and gradually becoming a leading figure amongst the younger generation of DJs. Though Hardwell could never have dreamed what laid ahead of him when starting his DJ career at the tender age of 13.DJ, Producer, Labelmanager, Music Lover and only at the age of 22… Let us present to you: Hardwell!\r\n\r\nA boy who takes his love for house music very serious, is step by step and gradually becoming a leading figure amongst the younger generation of DJs. Though Hardwell could never have dreamed what laid ahead of him when starting his DJ career at the tender age of 13.\r\n\r\nFor the last 2 years, Hardwell’s overall talent is recognised by the dance music industry as a new, exciting and refreshing take on a scene that continues to evolve and with an apparent everlasting shelf life! If you want to describe Hardwell’s identity and musical development in one phrase then it can be no other than that he’s now arrived in the “Big Room House” sound and has created his very unique trademark as a dj and producer.\r\n\r\nHis latest release, ‘Feel so High’ ft I-Fan, has been licensed to 10 countries, has had great support from the biggest names in the scene and comes with an amazing video! \r\n“Guess What”, a co-production with Chuckie,is likely to be one of the most played underground house records of the past two years and his “Show Me Love vs. Be” bootleg of Steve Angello and Laidback Luke’s track was one of the biggest dance hits of last year. \r\nIn 2009 he played at Mainstage, Dancevalley, the biggest festival in Holland where he was aso responsible fort hat years themesong “Twilight Zone”.\r\n\r\nDid we mention the remixes he did for some top DJs of the DJ Mag Top 100, such as Fedde Le Grand, Armin van Buuren, Tiesto, Bob Sinclar, Chris Lake, Funkerman, Laidback Luke, Sharam (Deep Dish), Steve Angello, Booty Luv and Hi_Tack? On top of this pronounced success stories, Hardwell has also topped the leading Dutch chart ‘Dance-Tunes.com’ a grand total of 6 times in the past 12 months. \r\nNot to forget, last summer he has also mixed one of the Privilege Ibiza Compilations next to Cosmic Gate. Also, Hardwell’s series of “Eclectic Beatz” belong to the best selling mix albums of the last few years. The final edition (#10) will be released April 2010! Need we go on?\r\n\r\nBehind the decks Hardwell never fails to deliver, his exceptional technical skills, variety of music and that added personal touch make him stand out, and he’s bringing it to the masses now, with performances all over the world! From Sydney to Miami, Amsterdam to London. \r\nThere’s a new kid on the block, and he’s here to stay.\r\n\r\nWith a new creative channel, his own record label Revealed Recordings, once again Hardwell appears to have the world at his feet",

While both have backgrounds making/composing music independently, their joint effort as Hemisphere allows them to collectively explore and experiment in a style that highlights both their strengths and interests in new and different ways.\r\n\r\nMisha Stephan, classically educated in music by his father since age 3 and having played in several bands throughout his youth, initially found his way into the electronic circuit in 2007. He later began fully producing music independently, as well as under the name Hollowman, which was signed and released by Deep Sense Records.  Misha's contributions to Hemisphere can often be heard in the melancholic, evolving melodies and synth elements of Hemisphere's sound.\r\n\r\nBram v.d. Boom started with his love for IDM music such as Aphex Twin, Autechre, etc. and has always had the computer as his primary instrument. He originally began producing music under his alias \"Minddigger\" in 1998 and is a fulltime lover of all sounds experimental and glitchy, elements commonly heard back in his contribution to Hemisphere as well. Later, for his own further development in the understanding of music, Bram also started to play bass-guitar, and is currently busy finishing up a degree in sound engineering.\r\n\r\nTogether, the two artists often help to add new creative dimensions to each other's work, while also practically reining each other in towards a more unified direction when needed. The combination results in an experimental, yet refined, musical collage that is fun to listen to and will easily have bodies flocking to the dance floor.",

He is always busy creating and initiating within multiple functions. He is a producer / DJ / promoter and concept developer.During the stage of growing to a be a man, he lived with parents who owned a bar and restaurant. His father still does. As a baby he thus has been growing between the coziness of entertainment. His father ran a nightclub, bar and several restaurants. He'd ride underneath the billiard with his tricycle or just before bedtime he would play on the CD player at the nightclub of his father.\r\n\r\nSince that time he felt passionated with music and how it connects people. Around his teens, he got his first turntables and mixer and started recording mixes through tapedecks. Short after that he build his own DJ booth with a friend.\r\n\r\nHe didn't evaluate much in the years after that until he started with breakdance and found out about this whole new subculture. He delved further into currents and influences and got to known a different kind of music. As an dancer he went into organizing dance events and making music. At these activities and meeting many new people, he discovered House music in its purest form. Fascinated by the Chicago and Detroit sounds he got inspired by Four to the floor music.\r\n\r\nIn terms of a musical spectrum he actually moves in all sort of directions. What important is to Yoeri is that it generates positivity, sincereness and soulfulness at all times. In Yoeri's opinion music should uplift you. You might recognize the positivity in his music....",

  "artist_bio": "DJ / Producer from Holland. Loves the dark sounds of Techno and Minimal Techno, but also likes a lot of other electronic music.Danielle M. N. Godiva aka GO!DIVA was born in Holland in 1980. She always had a passion for music. When house music got on her way she started to collect vinyl in 1992. A year later she went to her first big rave and started to produce hardcore with some friends. After a few years, DJs like Dave Clarke, Jeff Mills, Sven Vath, Richie Hawtin etc. got her back into techno music. \r\nIn 2001 she picked up producing again, with simple programs just for fun, so nothing serious. After 16 years of collecting vinyl and going to parties she got her first turntables at the end of 2007. In 2009 she started to play at parties/festivals and soon she realised that her passion for music was more than just a hobby and invested in some hardware and software to use and make music in a more professional way. \r\nGO!DIVA loves all kinds of electronic music, but mainly focus on techno. Her mixes are made with vinyl and Traktor (with timecoded vinyl). For producing she uses ableton, akai apc and vst`s. \r\n2010 started good for GO!DIVA. She made it into the finals of the Next Generation DJ contest. On february the 8th she had her first release `Be Patient` on Lot49 and more releases on Intertech Records, !Organism Records, Redbox Records, NBG-music and Brickwork are scheduled for later this year. On the 16th of february she started her own radioshow `GO!DIVA FM` on fnoob.com . \r\nHer favorit producers/dj`s are: Extrawelt, Popof, Umek, Trentemoller, Stephan Bodzin, Oliver Huntemann, Pan-Pot, Adam Beyer, The Advent & Industrialyzer, Joey Beltram, Pfirter, Virgil Enzinger, Sven Wittekind, Pig and Dan, Lutzenkirchen, Matthew Johnson, Alessio Mereu, Tomy Declerque, Secret Cinema, Julian Jeweil, Ortin Cam, Aphex twin, Prodigy, Mr Oizo and many more \r\n\r\nYou can find her on: \r\n\r\nhttp://soundcloud.com/go-diva\r\nwww.facebook.com/pages/dj-godiva/181817301366 \r\nwww.myspace.com/djgodiv \r\nhttp://twitter.com/djgodiva \r\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/go%21diva \r\nwww.fnoob.com",

That’s cool; the shock of the new is always an alluring and evocative sentiment within music. However, this isn’t the only method to employ when wanting to get noticed by the public. There’s also something to be said for developing your craft, biding your time, accumulating the knowledge needed to be a true sonic excavator. Whether by accident or design, Helt's musical emergence has been by the latter, far more scenic, path. As such, both his own productions and his experimental DJ sets are suffused with the very stuff of life: experience; depth and stuffed with music’s true elixer: Soul... \r\n\r\nFrom the beginning Helt's own musical output has revolved around more than just functional club music, regardless of whether it’s on the turntables or in the studio. Combining subtle arrangements that ride the deep vibes that lie between House and Techno, yet never forgetting the drive for the dance floor - that is what Helt's music is all about. Working together with other artists is also very important to Helt. In the summer of 2009 Helt released his first track with a collaboration called Amsterdam Sound Exchange. It was released worldwide by Dance4Life with the likes of Gui Boratto, Isis, Arjuna Schiks, Jesse Voorn and Sandrien (To name but a few). At the moment Helt has a residency @ the monthly Klein & Fijn the Code 21 in Amsterdam and works on his solo debut. Expect very deep house and techno with a very funky minimalistic approach and bits of Jazz, World-Music and Soul. \r\n",

Since their discovery by Ericke E, Groovenatics have not only established themselves as Sneakerz Muzik regulars, but have also proven to be a talented producer duo. Together they’re constantly searching for new sounds with one objective: to create and play authentic Dance music.\r\n\r\nThey may be young, but Groovenatics have already performed at some of the world’s leading Dance festivals including Dance Valley and Creamfields. You can also find them behind the decks at leading Dutch parties such as Sneakerz, Addicted and Housequake. And with remixes for the likes of Todd Terry, Baggi Begovic, Belocca & Soneec, Ron Carroll,  and Harrison Crump under their belt, Groovenatics prove they can hold their own in the world of Dance. These productions have been released on major labels such as Stealth Records, Leaders Of The New School (Toolroom), 1Trax (MN2S), Ultra, Vendetta Records, Rise and Spinnin Records.\r\n\r\nTracks ‘Can’t Get Enough’ with Quintino and ‘The Music’, a collaboration with Baggi Begovic, have helped to establish the Groovenatics sound in recent years. These productions have been picked up internationally and are strongly supported by House heavyweights including David Guetta, Axwell and Erick Morillo. In 2009 Groovenatics remix works were equally well-received, remixes for Leventina’s ‘Nightshift’ (Nikola & Groovenatics Remix) and Anthony’s ‘Why Can't We See’ (Groovenatics Remix) both made it into the Beatport charts. In the same year, Groovenatics compiled and mixed CD1 of the Sneakerz Winter Edition trilogy.\r\n\r\n2010 sees an abundance of new Groovenatics  material and several promising collaborations with artists like Quintino, Shermanology, Baggi Begovic and MC Yanto. Check out their remixes of Tom Jones – ‘Throw Back’ (Baggie Begovic & Groovenatics Remix) as well as Chris Kaeser’s ‘Back To The Rhythm’ (Groovenatics Remix). Groovenatics also continue to play at major events throughout the country, including their residencies at Housequake, Sneakerz Muzik and Kapsones (Club Vie).\r\n\r\nYou could say the Groovenatics story started back in 2007 with the release of ‘Lose Control’ on Dutch record label Sneakerz Muzik. Things certainly took off after that: They joined  international booking agency 1Management, home to artists like Fedde le Grand, Funkerman, and Baggi Begovic. Then came the release of “Bust A Move” in 2008, which fast became a well played record with many DJs. Their equally appealing summer track ”Joy” featuring Mitch Crown, followed and made its way onto several CD compilations and put the Groovenatics name on everyone’s lips.\r\n\r\nWith their strong productions and uplifting sets Groovenatics prove they have the whole package. They’re ready to go all the way, so expect even bigger things from these guys in the very near future!",

Guessbeats and Kidmalone started producing music at a very young age and transformed their style quickly into one belonging to the House scene.\r\n\r\nIn January 2014, the duo won a remix contest, organized by the Canadian label Turbo, which is owned by the world famous DJ Tiga. Not long after they released their song “Future Trunks” through Little Globe Records. During the summer of that same year.",

It al started when he was sixteen and got a job in a local bar where played tracks and taught himself to mix. After 3 years he bought his own decks. From that moment on Hayte Bouchier could be found on daily afternoon in the record shops in Amsterdam looking for the newest tracks. \r\n\r\nIn 2006 he first spun during club nights in Odeon Amsterdam. It was the first time he appeared for a larger audience. In the same year Hayte was cought by the upcoming music stream called minimal/techhouse. It was love at first sight, which made Hayte decide to fully embrace this subgenre of house music. \r\n\r\nAlso in 2006 together with two good friends they decided not to waste any time setup a club night called \"LinkeSoep\". This was the actual beginning of his passion for house music.\r\n\r\nAfter one year of doing production of Linke Soep, Piekup decided to enlarge the company, and Hayte was responsable for running the Bookings Agency called Piekup Bookings, at that time he arranged bookings for artist like: Marcus Meinhardt, Format B, Marco Resmann, Oliver Koletzki, Flowing, Andre Crom, Carlos Sanchez, Mathias Mesteno, and many more...\r\n\r\nBut that didn't finish his way into the scene, in 2010 he replaced the Agency for an new challange, It was time for Piekup's own recordlabel; Piekup Records! From scratch, Hayte Bouchier started the label, by collecting all details and businessplan. Together with Bert Jimmink they are running the label for an year now.

It was a split release with his mate, Piet van Dongen, and was the first step in producing music for the public. After releasing three records on Kompakt’s K2, he got in touch with the Manual Music family and felt right at home. This resulted in the grand performance of the Manual Orchestra in De Melkweg in Amsterdam. Around that time, Giorgos got his Masters degree in Management Science at the Radboud University Nijmegen. But music was his love, so he went for that.\r\n\r\nNow, Giorgos is releasing e.g. on Bedrock, Channels Music, Manual Music, Wolfskuil Records, Snejl and Outside The Box. He is always building on past experiences – trying to create a hybrid sound that is universal.\r\n\r\nGiorgos can be booked for Live and DJ performances.",

  "artist_bio": "GIRLS LOVE DJS \r\n\r\nGirls Love DJs is an international DJ act that guarantees a mindblowing set that will even have the most experienced partycrowds begging for more.  It’s not just an entertainment act: it’s actually a show that leads a legacy. \r\n\r\nWhat started out 10 years ago in the Supperclub as a small party slash get-together called GirlsLoveDJs, turned out to be exactly what Amsterdam nightlife was waiting for. The addictive energy from the crowd combined with the eclectic playfulness of the DJ’s created one of the craziest clubnights to ever hit The Netherlands… and it didn’t stop there.Nowadays we host clubs all over the country and even across the border with GirlsLoveDJs events in Stockholm, Dubai, London, Barcelona and many other cities around the globe. To top that off we also have our own massive stages at world-renowned festivals like Amsterdam Open Air, Q-Day Festival and Valhalla in the RAI. All of these events are (co-)produced by Enter Dexter, the creative production company behind many great things in life. Add that all up and see why we can truly say that we Party all day and Party all night!\r\n\r\nThe reason we threw a party in the first place was to create pumping clubnights and events with a wide variety of musical styles. Music became much more electronic over the years, and so did we, but the original concept is still intact – you can play almost any type of music as long as it’s sexy and basically impossible to stand still to. We can easily go from House and Electro to HipHop, Pop, Dubstep and back if all the tracks are right. This makes it very eclectic, but still very definable as one sound.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe vibe at our parties was so amazing, that we had no other choice than creating a DJ act that can bring the same celebration of life to clubs all around the world. It’s not just a DJ set, it’s a show with soul, history and a handpicked tracklist that has a fine mix of popular, recognizable and undeniable hits, accompanied with exclusive bootlegs, remixes and our own Girls Love DJs originals. We truly love what we do, and we keep trying to find the balanced combination between something outrageously original and interestingly commercial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Girls Love DJs act is a perfect collaboration of two notorious clublife animals and our former resident superstars from Amsterdam: Rob Zwart & Ron Simpson. They are always ready to tear the roof off so make sure you check out their sets, mixtapes, bootlegs and originals at the music page.\r\n\r\n \r\nAnd don’t forget: it’s not about us, it’s all about you!",

Proved himself over and over again with a distinctive style, and is often praised for a vary of unexpected twists in his sets.  His sets range from quality tech-house through minimal-house to straight fall-to-the-floor-techno. Gigs are an experience, he seems to have a sixth sense for dropping the right record at the right time.

By the end of 2010 they had their first works ready and In 2011 they released on platforms such as Ireland/Germany based Gobsmacked Records and UK based Transmissions.\r\n\r\nTheir first full album ‘Beethoven was deaf too!’ was released at US based Machine Box Records. After that they quickly made their way to other labels such as Rome’s The-Zone Records, where they released their well-received Duck & Cover EP, which included remixes from Austria’s Niereich, Italy’s Logotech and Germany based Cortechs. It was during the setup of this album that they got to know Niereich better, which proved to be a fruitful musical relationship. Shortly after, they released the Trans Lunar Injection EP together with him, which stayed in the Beatport top 100 techno for over a month. End 2011, Hackler & Kuch had their works released at big labels like Nachtstrom Schallplatten, TK Records, Construct Rhythm and The-Zone. The 2011 icon track Bombing Lessons on Torsten Kanzler’s TK records shook the underground techno scene and is still found in many sets\r\nacross the techno scene, including ones played at big events like Mayday.\r\n\r\nThe Fallout EP in 2012 with Niereich, which was released as a vinyl on Construct Rhythm, was quick to sell out and again was again played on big events such as Nature One, Toxicator and Mayday. The 2012 highlight was the set on Friday night main stage at Fusion Festival, a festival that is known all over the world as one of the best musical experiences within the electronic genre. End of 2012 Hackler & Kuch started their sell out Meltdown events, where they invited their friends like Industrialyzer, David Moleon and Axel Karakasis to play.\r\n\r\nNow in 2013, Hackler & Kuch are finishing a fresh EP for, Subfractal’s Frakture Audio and a big EP for Abstract, whom they recently joined forces with. Also Hackler & Kuch are joining forces again with Niereich and will present a double vinyl album in collaboration with Nachtstrom in the end of the year. To finish the album off, remixes are currently in the making by their friends A.Paul, Space Djz, Subfractal, Tex-Rec and Linus Quick. Make sure to keep an eye out for this project.",

Tech house became the basis of his sound, disco elements gradually become an integral part of his mixes, inspired by big names like Solomun, Maceo Plex, Odd Parents, Dashdot, Touchtalk, Blond:ish and etc. His sets are perfect harmony between Tech house, Deep house and Nu-Disco.         \r\n",

  "artist_bio": "There is an interesting duality to be found in their Homework guise: bringing back memories of childhood, restlessly waiting for that summer that never seems to arrive, unable to shake off the shackles of unfinished schoolwork… It combines both playfulness with serious business; nostalgia with immediacy. And so, to reference Kubrick's The Shining, the two could never be described as \"dull boys\".Bookings:\r\nWorldwide: jo@kimcoentertainment.com\r\nNetherlands: niels@meanwhile.nl\r\n\r\nAmsterdam-based duo Homework burst onto the electronic music scene in 2010 with a refreshing take on lush, Chicago-inspired house music, pricking up the ears of some of the most respected underground dance labels such as 20:20 Vision, Made To Play, and Berlin-based Exploited. Their Hudson Square EP – now a vinyl collectors item going for high prices on Discogs – garnered thumbs ups from both critics and peers and, seemingly overnight, turned them into internationally in-demand club djs. Within a year, after being catapulted into the limelight the duo found themselves playing all over the globe, box-checking revered clubs such as Berlin's Panoramabar, Paris' Social Club, The Standard in New York and Studio 80 in their hometown of Amsterdam; winning them a prestigious Dutch night life award, Gouden Kabouter for Best DJ Duo, in the process.\r\n\r\nOne defining feature of these two gentlemen it's that they are difficult to pigeonhole. Both in their productions as in their dj sets Homework always take an 'anything goes' approach. Their restless straddling of genres and inspirations, testament to years of working in well-known Amsterdam record store Concerto, might lead one to expect their kaleidoscopic oeuvre to be all over the place, but the inherent 'warmth' (or: 'umph' if you will) that permeates their music runs like a common thread through all their productions.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight it seems logical that, when in 2007 the duo decided to pursue a career in music, they chose the name Homework. There is an interesting duality to be found in their guise: bringing back memories of childhood, restlessly waiting for that summer that never seems to arrive, unable to shake off the shackles of unfinished schoolwork… It combines both playfulness with serious business; nostalgia with immediacy.

  "artist_bio": "lle Bitch, also known as Michael von L., crawled out of the Haarlem underground and is one of Holland’s most popular dj’s of this moment. His contagious enthusiasm and never ending attention for his fans has made him irreplaceable in the Dutch party scene.It was in 2002 when Ille Bitch first took place at the turntables. His flatmate, a dj known as Greg Martini, invited him to spin a record. It was a revelation for Ille, who soon started saving for his own equipment. In 2004 Ille had saved enough, he bought his first decks and launched his spinning career. He has been successful from the get go. With him a generation of ravers stood up and followed him to the best parties and supported him like he supported them. \r\n\r\nIt didn’t take long or the country was infected by the Ille-virus. He found his way to the dj-booths of clubs like Paradiso, 11, Lichtfabriek, Patronaat, Club Stalker, Poema, Tivoli, Effenaar, Club Rembrandt en LVC. There was no stopping when Ille Bitch and fellow-dj De Man Zonder Schaduw decided to spin together. At the same time Ille got residencies at Club Stalker, R3corder, Full Spectrum, Upstruct and Gasten zonder Grenzen. He spread his mix of house-electro-minimal-techno over the country and abroad like ink. \r\n\r\nDe Man Zonder Schaduw and Ille left a trail of satisfied dancers, lively party people and full clubs behind. After three years they decided to split up, leaving each other with the utmost respect as friends and colleagues. They said goodbye with a tour over the whole country. The last night took place in May 2008 and was a seven hour set in Club Stalker. \r\n\r\nBut no need to worry about Ille, he’s fine by himself. He is a well known artist in Holland, without a single release. But his recent his purchase of a laptop is the first step to producing. As a traditional vinylist Ille has made the step to digital. He tours the country with his midicontroller and laptop, using them to melt tracks of others to an exciting set. \r\n\r\nIlle will proceed his own dj-ing career and is starting to make his own production. No one knows what the future will bring, but knowing Ille it will be a great party.",

Not much later he started buying vinyl, and this time no vinyl with Dutch music!Nowadays the world is getting to know his music... For example by guestmixes in numerous broadcast on Radio 538 (the number 1 radiostation in The Netherlands), guestmixes in Dennis Ruyers Dance Department (March and June 2011) and Tiësto's Club Life (July 2010).\r\n\r\nHis productions (original tracks, remixes, bootlegs) played lots of times by the world's big time dj's. Artists like Sasha, John Digweed, Tiësto, Dave Seaman and Jody Wisternoff (Way Out West) are playing Jaaps productions over and over again and are dying to play his new stuff every time.\r\n\r\nThe styles/genres that Jaap plays, varies every gig, depending on the gig and crowd. Sometimes he plays very deep with deephouse and minimal, other times he treats the crowd with a more uplifting or raw sounding set. It all depends on the evening...",

The basic principle to this is a natural & funky rhythm.De muziekale achtergrond van House Intelligence heeft al een lang verleden als het gaat om elektronische muziek, eigenlijk al sinds begin jaren 80 toen de eerste digitale synthesizers en samplers zorgde voor een muzikale revolutie. \r\n\r\nVoor een lange tijd alleen op de achtergrond, in de studio of op de dansvloer, maar sinds een aantal jaar ook in de DJ Booth op diverse mooie locaties en festivals. Tevens dachten ze mee een aantal vernieuwende (club) concepten zoals o.a. IBZ Code, Modern Hippies en Irresistible. Op dit moment zijn ze bezig met een nieuwe concept waarover jullie vast nog veel meer zullen horen. \r\n\r\nDe DJ’s van House Intelligence willen maar een ding en dat is zorgen dat het publiek het naar z’n zin heeft. Gewapend met een zeer divers arsenaal van kwalitatieve tracks weten ze de dansvloer in beweging te krijgen. Moderne elektronische dans muziek van topkwaliteit en met een tijdloos karakter. Denk aan een gevarieerde mix van electronica, nu-disco, tech, afro, techno en house, funky, jazzy, uplifting en groovy. \r\n\r\nGeen dertien in een dozijn house hitjes, dubstep, dirty of alleen maar monotone techno. Het gaat om de totale beleving van een set. Het maken van unieke combinaties van verschillende stromingen van de hedendaagse house muziek zorgt er voor dat ze een eigen sound neer zetten.

Buying gear was the next step.\r\n\r\nIn 2002 the duo started to play behind the decks as bedroom DJ's and created the name Jacques Chips as a joke.\r\nThrough the years they've created their own individual style which makes their set unique when they play together. Their sound can be described as funky, raw, energetic and a little bit twisted.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, things became more serious when they did their first DJ act and decided to leave the name as it is.\r\nSince then, Jacques Chips has played aside with names like Secret Cinema , Michel de Hey, Benny Rodrigues, Bart Skills, Marco Bailey, Oscar Mulero, Dylan Drazen and DJ Rush.\r\nThey also played at Thailand's biggest Dance Festival called Culture One in Bangkok and at the biggest Dance Event of Holland in Amsterdam, Amsterdam Dance Event.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 they were the runner-up for the HEY! Your World DJ contest at the Bootleg DJ Cafe in Rotterdam.\r\nNow they are the residents of the legendary Techno party at \"De Boerderij\" in Zoetermeer: A.S.S.\r\n\r\nAfter a little break in 2010, the duo is making it's return in 2011.\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Ingy is part of Flowing. \r\nFlowing? Are you talking about Flow & Ingy from Amsterdam? That crazy, wild, energetic, nicely disturbed DJ couple, that's always dancing and partying with the crowd?\r\n\r\nHell yeah!Flowing? Are you talking about Flow & Ingy from Amsterdam? That crazy, wild, energetic, nicely disturbed DJ couple, that's always dancing and partying with the crowd?\r\n\r\nHell yeah!\r\n\r\nIt was a magical moment in Amsterdam's club “Melkweg”, when a pretty blond girl wearing an out-of-place blouse met a drunk DJ called Flow. He poured her some vodka and kissed her in the neck. She tasted salty from all the dancing. They made out on the dance floor and rock-n-rolled all night...\r\n\r\nThe girl was named Ingy, and together they started organizing small, illegal parties. Flow however, was always trying to convince Ingy to start mixing as well. And finally, at a nice afterparty at his place, she was brave enough to take it on. She turned out to be very talented and to have great feeling for the music. They decided that from then on they should always play together, and Flowing was born.\r\n\r\nTrue or false?\r\n\r\nIngy plays piano / keyboards, and she loves to sing. She has the voice of a 73 year old crooner who smoked 2 packs of cigarettes and drank a bottle of scotch every day of his life, so she's not your average Norah Jones. - TRUE\r\n\r\nFlow played piano and bluesharp in some jazz and blues bands and even performed live on Beale street in Memphis, Tennesee - home of the blues! - TRUE\r\n\r\nBoth having a musical background, Flow & Ingy felt like they should be doing more then just playing other peoples music, so they took on producing. Their first EP \"The Bluesman\", with a Lauhaus remix, was released on vinyl and digital format in June 2009, on Andre Croms brand new label called VIVID. Played by Karotte, Derrick May, Simon Baker, Luna City Express, MEAT, and many, many more it was a great success. The organ and piano you hear in the track were played and recorded live! - TRUE\r\n\r\nIngy practised ballet for 12 years, so she knows her moves. One time, during a set, she jumped out of the DJ booth right on top of the huge woofer and danced with the crowd... she mixed in the next track from the wrong side of the booth and just continued dancing, and the people (especially the guys) loved it. - TRUE\r\n\r\nFlow & Ingy got married and officially became Flowing on the 28th of May in 2008. It was a beautiful day and an amazing “Berlin roaring 20's style” dinner and party in in the famous bar-restaurant-club 11 (RIP) in Amsterdam. - TRUE\r\n\r\nFlowing adopted two party parrots, a boy and a girl, who always travel with them. The parrots are totally crazy, and dance to the music all night long. After a couple of vodka shots they scream of pleasure: WRAAH! - TRUE\r\n\r\nFlowing organizes the Club Krang parties in Amsterdam, with people like Julietta, Livio & Roby, Nick Curly, Polder, MEAT, Andre Crom, Junction SM, and many many more. - TRUE\r\n\r\nAt their infamous afterparties or at special gigs, Flow & Ingy sometime do crazy live stuff in which they sing and / or use real instruments. No more information about this can be given, but if you ask the right people... you might get to know more or even see a video! - TRUE\r\n\r\nFlowing already rocked dancefloors all over Europe and beyond... some highlights being: Thaibreak 2009, Harry Klein in Munich, Welcome to the Future festival 2009 (closing set), U60311 in Frankfurt, Club der Visionaire, East port festival, Sunday getaway @ Funkpark / Rechnencentrum and many more places in Berlin, Summerwave festival 2008 and 2009 @ Military base of Hassel / Eystrup, Paradiso, Studio 80, Flexbar in Amsterdam, Hotel Digital in Alzenau, Manga club in Jena, Diskosoff in Cologne plus many more, and they will continue creating dancefloor mayhem in the future - TRUE\r\n",

Stepping out of clich?s and trends they always try to put forth something original. Starting out as a breakbeat duo it became clear that they wanted to take on a different approach. Keeping in mind the strong and funky rhythms of breakbeat they successful walked into the lane of techhouse and progressive.\r\n\r\nGetting more and more noticed by people in the dance scene they decided to stick to it. 2005 was the year their first bigger gig came up which was at Extrema’s Solar Weekend. After that an appearance on Paaspop followed up, where they performed at the Extrema stage.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 their first production “Around Us” was released on Rene Amesz’s new label “25 Hertz”. Accompanied by an Amesz remix. Soon it got picked up by biggers like Pete Tong and John Digweed.\r\n\r\nIn 2007 Infinitize produced a remix for Rene’s original called “My Favourite Barbie”, also released on 25Hertz again getting lots of support from top dj’s.\r\n\r\nAfter that ExtremaMusic took them under their wings.",

Through his own family of labels –Lowendcommunity and Nightworx/NWX– he launches his own productions and musical tastes upon the scene. \r\n\r\nIvo Foreal a.k.a. one half of N.U.D.E., The Low End Theory, Terrace Junkies -was born in Kassel (Germany) in 1975. He moved to The Netherlands with his parents when he was just a little boy. Even back then Ivo was interested in all kinds of music. His father was involved in organising jazz music concerts, so he got to listen to alot of music already from young age. \r\n\r\nOn a later age Ivo finished his economical study and got a job.  In 1997 he started to DJ in a few small bars in Eindhoven (Holland) where he got the chance to play in front of small audiences and practicising the general dj skills. \r\n\r\nAfter r a few years Ivo became the resident DJ at a new club in Eindhoven: De Rechter. Club Risk, a promoter from Amsterdam, also asked Ivo to be the resident DJ for their new nights in De Rechter. \r\nIn 2002 he made a mix cd for Puschkin Residency, a promotional CD release sponsored by Puschkin Vodka. \r\n\r\nOver the folowing years he played with names like: Tania Vulcano (Circo Loco), Reche (Space Ibiza), Pako & Frederik (Global Underground), Sander Kleinenberg, Billy Nasty and many more to name. \r\n\r\nA few of the venues he played at are: Café d’Anvers (Antwerp, Belgium), Supperclub (Amsterdam), La Rocca (Lier, Belgium), De Rechter (Eindhoven), Blue Marlin (Ibiza), Poema (Utrecht), Humanite (Extrema, Eindhoven), De Danssalon (Eindhoven), Home (Budapest, Hungary). \r\n\r\nHis all time hero is already for many years Danny Tenaglia. This man is without a doubt his biggest example! Other Dj’s that inspired him in the last years are: Tania Vulcano, Locodice, Ricardo Villalobos, Pan Pot, Umek, Joel Mull and Chymera.\r\n\r\nIn 2010 Ivo and a  friend, Dimitri van Arnhem, started their label: Lowendcommunity. \r\nTheir first release was the 1st of october 2010 on Lowendcommunity. \r\nBefore the label started they got already full support on some of their upcoming releases from names like Laurent Garnier, Michel de Hey, Jeff Mills, Hermanez and many more.\r\nA sister label Nightworx/NWX was set up in 2011.\r\n\r\nFor info or bookings:\r\n\r\ninfo@night-worx.com\r\n\r\nlowendcommunity.com\r\n\r\ninfo@lowendcommunity.com",

Beach club Mecca was ones set up and property by Dinand Woesthoff, the singer of the famous Dutch band 'Kane'. The beach club was organized as lounge club with an inconceivable quantity of old worn-out sofa’s and cushions. The terrace with camouflage stretched nets and, in evening time in the middle of the lounge-part, the fire gets high. Mecca was known by his Piracy & underground style that was one of the first Beach clubs that could expose the Ibiza atmosphere in Holland. From the speakers you could hear heavy sounds of the latest underground music.\r\n\r\nIvan is a fan of Bootsy Collins playing funky baselines on his bass guitar & the funky beat of the P-FUNK. The Groovy sexy sound was his inspiration. The end of the 80’s –beginning of the 90’s he discovered ‘Acid House’ in the legendary club Roxy in Amsterdam (later called House Music). \r\n\r\nHow can you describe Ivan’s \"style\"? I only can say that it's not possible to put him in a typical place. Ivan got his own style. When he plays his deep sexy sounds, your body starts to move and put you in a high atmosphere. The music goes from African – Latin beats to sexy percussion sounds and up whipping Funky deep House. \r\nIvan know how 'to play' with the crowd. \r\n\r\nIvan was known since 1998 as DJ IVANMARK and formed “The Groove Selectors” and “Mecca Dj-Team” when he was discovered in 2002 by Phillip Morris at Mecca.\r\nSince then Phillip Morris booked him regularity for Dance Valley, Club Challenge and The Marlboro Masters. \r\n\r\nI asked Ivan, what are your goals in DJ-Land, or how do you see your near future. \r\nSuddenly there's a big 'smile' on his face and he says: \"The summers play at Ibiza and Bali in wintertime. Simply said, I want to go international”. \r\n\r\nDJ IVANMARK played as a club DJ at DJ-Café (Ibiza), Club Double Six and Club Bacio (Bali, Indonesia) Hotel Adriatico (Kroatie), Dance Valley, Marlboro Club Challenge, The Marlboro Masters, TWSTD (Amsterdam), Asta, Mecca, Silly Symphonies, Zeta, Havana, Beach Club Jelly Fish, Gabors, Whoosah (The Hague), Tampopo (Rotterdam), Woodstock, BLM9 (Bloomingdale) etc.\r\n\r\nBecause he did grow the last years it’s time for ‘the next level’. This year he will lance his 1st track.\r\nHis CD’s will be out soon. \r\n",

When he moved to Amsterdam at the age of 18 he was overwhelmed by the electronic dance scene. He began to develop his musical taste and his production skills.

The love for music was born. When he left the parental house, his music equipment went as well. Tirelessly, she continued practicing long hours at the piano, but deep inside she craved for the stronger beats. \r\n\r\nBarbara got captivated by the Amsterdam nightlife when she was 16 and with it she discovered Minimal and Techno. She loved its dark tones and raw beats, already played by her heroes Max Cooper, Kollektiv Turmstrasse and Extrawelt.\r\n\r\nLater on, Barbara was taught how to digitalise her sets by her close friend (and mentor) Joris. The first small gigs - mostly afterparty’s - came her way. \r\nIt was her performance two years later at an after party of Zeezout, that gave her a big head start, resulting in a position as Resident DJ at the bookings agency Zeezout. \r\n\r\nCurrently she is focused on producing her own music; music with a feeling.\r\n",

In the autumn of 2005 they both moved to Rotterdam to start their studies. But it also gave them lots of inspiration for the sound they are playing nowadays. The electronic music adventure just started.\r\n\r\nTheir dj-sets can not be described as one sound, it's a solid mix of deep/techy house, minimal and techno driven by grooving basslines and funky percussion rhythms.\r\n\r\nIn 2007 Hertz & Vibes reached the finals of the Amsterdam based TWSTD dj-contest at the famous dutch club 'De Melkweg'. Every year, the Dommelsch TWSTd DJ Contest involves 160 promising new DJ's who go head to head for more than 80 rounds. Reaching the finals in Hollands biggest and most respected dj-contest was again a confirmation for Hertz & Vibes to go on with their musical career.\r\n\r\nIn december 2007 they got the opportunity to host their own clubnight called 'Diepgang' at the Catwalk in Rotterdam. From the beginning it was a huge succes which resolved in a residency at this club untill February 2011. They invited names like Adam Beyer, Alan Fitzpatrick, Cari Lekebusch, Deetron, Joris Voorn, Joel Mull, Paul Ritch and Secret Cinema. Artists who were a great inspiration for Hertz & Vibes over the last years.The duo also came under the attention of Michel de Hey, and Hertz & Vibes became residents of the Hey! parties @ Catwalk. During this period they played next to Josh Wink, Paul Kalkbrenner Joseph Capriati, Sneak, 2000andOne and Alex Celler.\r\n\r\nBesides their residency in Catwalk Rotterdam Hertz & Vibes have been playing in venues like Studio80, Maassilo, Ahoy, Off Corso, Melkweg, Poema, FFWD Dance Parade, Free Your Mind Festival etc. and countries like Turkey, Belgium, Spain, Poland and Croatia.\r\n\r\nNowadays Hertz & Vibes are focusing on their musical productions. Together with dj and producer Arthur Leicher they started their own label, Moments Music (www.moments-music.eu). So stay tuned, because there is much more to come!\r\n\r\nMore info at www.hertzandvibes.com.\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Jasper Wognum is an Amsterdam based Producer and DJ.\r\nTogether with Lukas Pauka he forms House duo Raw Underground.Jasper started DJ-ing back in 1987. After a couple of years playing mainstream dance music he switched to House music in 1990. After gaining 10 years of experience at Amsterdam parties and clubs such as Roxy, Melkweg, Paradiso and Escape he teamed up with Peter Kriek (now 16bit Lolita’s) to form a duo called SNAFU, producing mainly progressive tech-house tracks. After a few demo’s they signed a record deal with Sadie Records and The Orange Dance Company. Funny fact: The duo accidentally won an Armin van Buuren Remix Contest in 2001. Although house music was the main genre, Jasper never stopped exploring other styles. He hosted a two-weekly night in Amsterdam, played tech-house tunes on many parties and traveled to Germany, France, Spain and the UK to play his records. In 2002 Jasper left the scene for a while to finish his study in Artificial Intelligence and get a daytime job. Productions and mixes appeared every now and then, but nothing serious.\r\n2012 saw the birth of Raw Underground, a new duo formed with producer Lukas Pauka. The duo found a shared passion for classic, soulful house music and started producing. The first and second track they made together were picked up by Amsterdam based record label Cosmic Disco.",

Highly influenced by Amsterdam stalwarts like Rush Hour and Delsin, but grounded in their love for the Motor City.\r\n\r\nIt gained them a residencty at the legendary (and late) club Trouw in Amsterdam, but also the support of the illustrious Concrete in Paris.

  "artist_bio": "Back in 1990, Jaimy was one of the first Dutch producers who succeeded in making a living with house music. He obtained his first record deal at the age of 19 and being adopted by Amsterdam’s Outland Records, just before their period of grandeur, Jaimy was responsible for much of the music coming from the Outland studios. He collaborated with many Dutch DJs, and produced multitudes of other dance floor smashes. Few of these successes were as big as the house classic ‘On The Discotrain’, his remix of ‘I Gotta Let You Go’ by Dominica, or his ‘Keep on Pumpin’ under the Thyone Girls moniker - which was licensed to the legendary Tribal America and reached #6 on Billboard.Back in 1990, Jaimy was one of the first Dutch producers who succeeded in making a living with house music. He obtained his first record deal at the age of 19 and being adopted by Amsterdam’s Outland Records, just before their period of grandeur, Jaimy was responsible for much of the music coming from the Outland studios. He collaborated with many Dutch DJs, and produced multitudes of other dance floor smashes. Few of these successes were as big as the house classic ‘On The Discotrain’, his remix of ‘I Gotta Let You Go’ by Dominica, or his ‘Keep on Pumpin’ under the Thyone Girls moniker - which was licensed to the legendary Tribal America and reached #6 on Billboard.\r\n\r\nSometime around 1998 he met his musical partner Kenny D. Production wise, Jaimy & Kenny D released most of their stuff with Black Hole Recordings, but also signed tracks and projects to United Recordings, Combined Forces and Paul Oakenfold’s Perfecto label. Their smash hit ‘Keep On Touchin Me’, got picked up and reworked by Erick Morillo’s Subliminal label and was signed to Skint Records/Loaded for a UK re-release. They’ve also remixed projects such as Halo Varga’s ‘Future’ on Hooj Tunes, DJ Taucher’s ‘Science Fiction’ on Additive Records, DJ Tiësto’s ‘Flight 643’, and Way Out West’s ‘Mind Circus’ on Black Hole Recordings.\r\n\r\n2001 saw the birth of Jaimy & Kenny D’s own label, Fatal Tracks, administered and distributed by Black Hole Recordings for two years. Among notable single releases like ‘Time’, ‘Music=Our Future’, and 'Like A Bitch' (the opening track on Sasha & Digweed's album 'Communicate'), Jaimy also put out the single CD compilation ‘Fatal Tracks vol. 1’ and the double CD compilation ‘Fatal Tracks vol. 2’, and the collaborative album with Kenny D, ‘Is There Any Other Way?’\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Jaimy took the independent route and set up his label Fatal Music. A year later, Drum Mode followed. Both labels represent the sounds of House that one can expect to hear when Jaimy steps behind the decks: soulful, vocal, funk, disco, dark, deep and dirty. The labels received strong support right away from Chus & Ceballos, Tom Stephan, Behrouz, Victor Calderone, and one and only Danny Tenaglia - who in 2006 called Jaimy his favorite producer. Jaimy repaid the complement with a sizzling remix of Danny’s track ‘Dibiza’ on Stereo.\r\n\r\nJaimy began offering his expert engineering services to his clients with the formation of his Fatal Mastering in 2009. He also had a breakout club hit that year with “Take Your Higher” featuring May-Britt and Michelle David. The Belocca remix has appeared on several compilations including Fedde Le Grand’s ‘Toolroom Knights’ DJ mix and ‘The Amazone Project’ by Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano on Spinnin. If that wasn’t enough, he formed a musical partnership with popular Dutch DJ/producer Jeroenski, working together regularly on numerous projects, and eventually Jaimy’s company began administering Jeroenski’s label Pescado Recordings.\r\n\r\nIt was a busy year for Jaimy in 2010, first there were major remixes for Alex Graham on Skint, Anane Vega and Oscar G on Nervous, Rulers Of The Deep on MUM and Celeda on Mile End. He launched his own musical concept called Freaking Out which consists of a bi-weekly radio mix/podcast, which is aired on Dance-Tunes Radio online and on Radio Nova FM in Bulgaria, and a digital compilation series on Fatal Music. Freaking Out Vol. 1 got released in 2010 and Vol. 2 in 2011. The concept reflects a half-decade of being on the go with his label, with a spirit that embodies his energetic house sound. A sound that touches many genres but that is aimed straight for the dance floor and to simply have people freak out!\r\n\r\nJaimy's style as a DJ is still as diverse as his productions after all of these years and he remains as fresh as ever. He has DJ-ed major events such as Sensation, Dance Valley, Inner City, along with a DJ tour of the clubs in Europe and abroad. He loves to combine all kinds of house genres. His sets are uplifting and pumping, sexy and funky. His weaponry of 100% exclusive tracks, unique sound, and the ability to blend many styles together distinguishes him. He is able to create unbelievable energy on the dance floor. Jaimy is an artist who lives to make people dance. A job he does very well: producing and DJ-ing!",

From fathers side came rock and jazz. Funk and soul Watts discovered by listening to his mothers records. \r\n\r\nAbout ten years ago Watts bought two turntables plus a mixer to start playing some music of is own. He discovered a great new love: techno.\r\n\r\nEspecially Swedish, Detroit and Chicago techno were amongst Watts' favorites. Carl Lekebusch, Derrick May, Adam Beyer were great sources of inspiration. But in the end it is Jeff Mills who really made him fall in love with the genre. Jeff's unique, but also old school way of mixing in combination with his energy and precision were for Watts the ingredients, which give extra dimension to electronic music.\r\n\r\nWhen James Watts had his first dj-gig he was at once hooked. Behind the decks Watts found a home were he is best able to express his emotions and creativity. Watts engages his public with his enthusiasm and love for music. Unfortunately, due to a heavy traffic accident in 2003, Watts' just found dj career was cut short. \r\n\r\nAfter years of rehabilitation and even having to learn to listen to music all over again, Watts' out take on music changed. The heavy 130-bpm techno was tuned down to a more relaxed 120/126 bpm. Although techno is still at the heart of it all, Watts now intertwines disco, Detroit and Chicago house with techno. Watts' interest is now in the groove and the rhythm of the sound instead of the genre.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2008, Watts makes his come back at the \"Maximaal Nijmegen\". It is his first performance after his accident 5 years earlier. For Watts it’s a confirmation that he feels most at home in a booth. A year later his career receives a new impulse when he hears in a live radio interview with Dave Clarke, White Noise radio, that he is the winner of the Dave Clarke Extreme Outdoor Contest. Dave Clarke invites him to open the stage of Extreme Outdoor 2009. As if that is not enough, on the same day Watts is asked to do a back-to-back set with Patch Park. \r\n\r\nAfter this restart of his career and acknowledgement of his talent, Watts decides to create his own venue were he can play his own sound. This becomes the SoulDrum nights in Club Merleyn in Nijmegen, were  a combination of warm house, disco and techno create an exceptional experience. Till this day, the SoulDrum nights are a success.\r\n\r\nWatts decides to move to Amsterdam at the end of 2009. Producing is now playing a significant part in his musical career. The possibilities in Amsterdam are an extra stimulant for Watts to invest in his own sound.\r\n\r\nBeginning of 2010 Dave Clarke invites Watts to play at one of Clarke's nights at the \"Effenaar\"  in Eindhoven. Furthermore, Clarke asks Watts to take care of the dj set during his ADE showcase in \" de Melkweg\" in Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nLooking towards the future, Watts will increasingly focus on producing music and organizing his own club nights. Furthermore, he wants to showcase SoulDrum outside Nijmegen as well and launch a new concept in Amsterdam to make the dance scene even livelier. Watts will not play less music due to all of these plans, because behind the decks he still feels most at home.",

Since he’s been at the top for several years with his band, Jamie felt is was time for a new challenge. And off course music had to be an important part of this challenge. The Hague ‘enfant terrible’ and friend Billy the Klit took him by the hand and introduced him at several nightclubs in Holland. At this point Jamie became a well known DJ at all notable Dutch parties such as Franchise, Nope is Dope and Hed Kandi. Soon Jamie was playing with DJ-hero Bad Boy Bill at the Rotterdam Maassilo. Alltough time went fast for the Dutch centipede his star is still rising.",

His technical skills are envied by many and his passion for music is something you experience just by being present at one of his gigs. \r\nA big name in the scene and one to remember. Known for his ambition, passion and natural talent! His technical skills are envied by many and his passion for music is something you experience just by being present at one of his gigs. \r\n\r\nJayden Alva was born in London but moved to Holland just months after his birth. Alva comes from a very musical family so it wasn’t something new being surrounded by different kinds of music. He was brought up listening to Rock and Pop and even classical music but after a few years his love for Electronic music became a fact. The beginning of his passion for Electronic music came after hearing a Dutch formation named 2 Unlimited, one of Hollands most successful music bands in the early nineties. After that he was hooked on the Electronic sound. \r\n\r\nHe started to learn DJ-ing when he was just a teenager and soon his friends found out that he wasn't an average kid who dreams of becoming a dj but one with talent, skills and a five star potential of becoming one of the greatest in the scene. His choice of tracks is something that makes him unique, these are not just tracks being played and mixed, but together they are a journey that takes you on a hell of a ride! He started listening to sets of Paul Oakenfold, Tiësto, Armin Van Buuren, Carl Cox and many others at a very young age just to learn the style of mixing by each individual artist. \r\n\r\nAfter playing in clubs and events in his home base the Netherlands his name started growing, not just in Holland but more importantly outside the border. Looking back at his passionate career it wasn't a surprise being booked for his first international tour. His first tour took him to Asia with a highlight of performing in Bali. Not surprisingly sold out weeks in advance! After his Asia tour, Europe and the Middle East followed where he played in cities such as Dubai, London, Amsterdam and Prague to name but a few. With his energetic house, progressive and trance sound it's impossible to put him in a box. Every set is a surprise and every track is one to remember. \r\n\r\nAccording to the respected Dj List Jayden Alva belongs to the top 1 percent of the best dj's in the world alongside Tiesto, Armin, Ferry Corsten, Above & Beyond and many other elite artists. A very big accomplishment but no surprise!\r\n\r\nJayden Alva is one of the few DJ’s who is officially sponsored by one of the fastest growing companies in Dubai named Sempurna, meaning ‘perfect’. As the company does business all over the world they needed a DJ who sounds as perfect as their name. His sound spreads like fire and there is not enough water to break it down!\r\n\r\nJayden Alva is a DJ born to shake the grounds under any club on this planet. His home is behind the decks and he has no intention of moving!",

  "artist_bio": "DJ and Producer.The origin of Jazz Rath’s music career lies somewhere between vivid recollections and nostalgia. It was the gift of a cassette tape, that sparked a need to investigate music. This analog sentiment from the walkman era contained a diverse combo, one that would remain the base of what he plays today. A mix of hip-hop, house, garage and forgotten so-good-so-bad tunes.\r\n\r\nFor two years he would practice in his bedroom, before he made his first club appearance by the age of 16. Today he’s a resident at Fat Kids Cake, De Nachtdivisie and Boobytrap Boys with various gigs throughout Amsterdam nightlife — the rest is history.",

  "artist_bio": "Tuneskin Recordings frontman Jeng Do produces electronic music from 1993. His producing love is deep emotional music with a techno drive. On his label nights \"Skindip\" and his Rotterdam residency \"Sacre Bleu\" he plays his unique dj- and live sets.Surrounded by improvised jazz from his earliest years, this Dutch producer played the flute at the age of 5 to learn notes and schemes and played classical piano from the age of six. Untill around the age of 14, when he got introduced to music software. His interests had already gone to hip hop, rock and the first house music and the ability to create a beat with melodious tunes himself was all he ever wanted; a producer was born. Creating complete tracks from the start, he remixed hip hop, created jazzy melodious chill music and experimental house music at first. From around '93 he came accross sets and tracks of the pioneers (Derrick May, Richie Hawtin, Dimitri, Remy, etc.) and his own sound gradually developed to electro and techno of the deep kind, along with the development of techno itself and its scenes.\r\n\r\nSpring '99 he moved from his hometown Alphen a/d Rijn to Amsterdam, where he organized several parties with friends in a venue he had set up, literally underground. His music kept developing and after a move to Rotterdam Spring '03 he focused more on spreading his music. Soon he was active in the Rotterdam scene, doing work for several projects and he started working on a live set. March '05 he did his first live set at Bootleg and more live gigs followed at other venues in and around Rotterdam. His live sets varied from chill sets to pounding techno sets, depending on venue, time and atmosphere, able to play a wide range of unique quality productions. Summer '06 he decided to set up Tuneskin, backed up with a fresh sound and name, Jeng Do. NYE '06/'07 he performed live as Jeng Do for the first time and the following years he played live sets on Sound Architecture (Off Corso, Catwalk), Amsterdam Dance Event (Supperclub), Solar Festival (Roermond), Planet Rose (Doornroosje), Awakenings (Maassilo) and many more techno orientated events. Summer '07 he was scouted to participate in Holland's biggest music contest \"Grote Prijs van Nederland\" and he reached the semi-finals. In '08 several digital releases appeared and February '09 the first Jeng Do solo vinyl release was there: Nine Five EP on Sound Architecture Records (SA007).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Tuneskin developed to be a platform for several quality and unique artists, like main resident dj Kadir Pelit. Tuneskin connected more and more with Catwalk Club Rotterdam, where July 30th '09 the first Tuneskin showcase took place. More showcases at Catwalk followed and November 14th '09 at Catwalk the official Tuneskin Label Special kicked off with its first edition: Skindip 001. Only a few weeks later the first Tuneskin release was there (Dec 1st '09), Woken. In the first months of '10 Broaden EP and Seven III EP appeared, followed by Father EP and Dream EP. Halfway the year, July 31st, the first anniversary of Tuneskin was celebrated at Catwalk with a splendid 2nd edition of Skindip. Oct 23rd a special Amsterdam Dance Event edition followed: Skindip 003.\r\n\r\nEarly '10 Jeng Do became manager of the struggling yet beloved club Catwalk. Not much later music mastermind Sandeep was brought in for the music programming and a successful team was born. Within months Catwalk was on a track of bringing a particular sound, suiting the good old and improved Catwalk vibe, with a dedicated crew attracting a deep house/techno loving audience from all over the country and abroad, filling the club two days and later three days a week. May 2010 the Catwalk Dj Contest started, organized by Tuneskin. Hosts Jeng Do and Sandeep went in search of true talent from May till October on quality nights. Boy wonder Sab Titos won the contest and became Catwalk resident.\r\n\r\n2011 started with an amazing Release Party in January at Catwalk for Jeng Do's Embrace EP. Soon after that, Gratitude EP appeared. Grateful for love and life and introducing Tuneskin vocalist Sherida. Unfortunately despite Catwalk's revival and gaining of international recognition, after a longtime judicial struggle with the landlord Catwalk had to leave the tunnel by the end of April. After having introduced Sab Titos on his label with \"Present Chord\" on Present EP, along with Jeng Do's track Nadehzda, he released Share EP in July. With Share EP he introduced yet another Catwalk resident and quality debut producer on his label: Jamie Lie A Kwie. For the time being he moved his release parties to Bootleg, the place where he did his first live set back in '05. July 9th the first of two release parties took place at Bootleg, supported by Catwalk. The vibe was amazing, the support fantastic. July 29th Tuneskin hooked up with Catwalk’s Afterling for a fresh party at Pakhuis in Rotterdam titled GUERILLA! and in September the second release party at Bootleg followed, yet another wonderful night, introducing yet another artist on his label, MC Elevated in \"Connect\" on Connect EP.\r\n\r\nThe activity in the Rotterdam scene producer-wise, dj-wise, club-wise and label-wise continues. Creating music, releasing music, supporting quality artists on his label and events and making a quality contribution to the Rotterdam scene, with always soul moving music as main focus. Stay tuned for releases on Tuneskin Recordings and fresh release parties and label specials in underground venues.\r\n\r\n[last updated: Sept '11]",

  "artist_bio": "JensbyJensby, the highly talented House, Deep House, Tech House DJ and producer from London has accomplished a great deal since exploding onto the scene 5 years ago. Jensby drew the attention of the spotlight early in his career thanks to his production and mixing skills which were discovered in 2010 by Sam Young / Vanilla Ace who is London’s number one DJ and was awarded the ‘Best DJ Award’ twice in 2007 and 2010. From this point on Jensby showed his ability to produce tracks which leave his fans and listeners wowed. During his live DJ sets Jensby’s technical ability of mixing records and his diligent record selection always makes the crowd go crazy. By being signed to the world’s biggest labels such as Armada Music, Cr2 Records and Ego Music it comes to no surprise that his tracks have been supported by DJs such as Tiesto, Armin Van Buuren, Chuckie, MYNC, Sam Young/Vanilla Ace, Dannic, Hardwell, Roger Sanchez and many more. \r\nJensby’s career properly started in 2009 when he regularly started to play his DJ sets on private events, in bars and clubs in London and Germany. By being inspired by his DJ sets it was only when he wanted to set himself apart from other DJs that he began experimenting with production and producing original tracks and remixes to add something special and unique to his sets. In 2010 at the age of 17 Jensby released his first EP on “Crossair Recordings” and “Celestial Recordings”. His track “Good Morning Kreuzberg” was supported by the house music pioneer Roger Sanchez. In 2011 Jensby started collaborating on several productions with Sam Young with whom he had already played DJ sets in London’s clubs together. The outcome of this collaboration was ‘Dancing (Jensby & Sam Young Remix)’ a remix for one of UK’s biggest ‘Garage’ legends Zed Bias. The remix quickly went viral, especially in the Deep House scene and got and still gets played frequently around the UK and in London’s Clubs. When the track was re-released in 2014 it gained 25,000 plays on Soundcloud in just two weeks. Jensby then went on to release multiple records such as ‘This is Miami’ which was supported by no other than Chuckie before catching the attention of the major labels.\r\nAt the age of 19 Jensby released his track “Foldback (Original Mix)” on one of UK's biggest dance music labels Cr2 Records. The track instantly grabbed the attention of many high profile DJs and was supported by Tiesto who played it in his sets in front of 20,000 people. Other supporters include Quintino, Dannic and Hardwell. A few months later “Timewarp (Original Mix)” the follow up production was picked up by Armin Van Buuren and signed to his label Armada Music / Trice. The listeners loved the track which is why it reached 20,000 plays on YouTube in just two weeks. Armada Music describes Jensby as: “This young, London-based talent rips up the floors and makes the bass hit in right where needed.” Following the success of the above mentioned tracks, Jensby was asked to remix “Anyday (Original Mix) - Dzeko & Torres” who are two of the most up and coming Artists in the EDM industry. The remix was released on Cr2 Records and has hence been featured on several Ibiza and EDM compilation CDs including tracks by artists such as Oliver Heldens, Morgan Page, Paul Oakenfold, Dirty South, Marco V, Dyro, Inpetto, Tommy Trash and many more. Following the success of “Anyday”, Jensby and Sam Young were approached by Ego Music, Italy’s most prestigious dance label to produce a remix for “Criminal - Vox Halo Feat. La Dolla”. The label loved the mix and released it right away together with the original track. In 2014 Jensby teamed up with Marciniak to produce a remix for the track “Refugee” by Oi Va Voi. The remix received an outstanding response and was voted as “one of the best tracks” on www.wavo.me, the fastest growing social music app on the web by its A&R team. Two days later it hit the No.1 Spot in the “Deep House Chart” and “Overall Top 50” which gave the track exposure to about 100,000 people. Currently Jensby is working on several remixes and collaborations with upcoming artists and notable artists in the Deep and Tech House scene. Over the years Jensby has played in clubs all around Europe as prestigious as e.g. “Pacha London” and on several private events with crowds ranging up to 2,000 people. His sets have been described as energetic, uplifting and dynamic which is due to his ability to read the crowd and to create an unique atmosphere wherever he plays. Jensby’s new Radio Show “Get Down Radio” which he launched in 2014 and is aired in London gets listened to across the UK and Europe. In April 2015 Jensby released his “Get Down EP” on Crossworld Records which gained support by no other than the House, Techno legends Richie Hawtin, Marco Carola and Paco Osuna. It is apparent that Jensby’s career is on a continuous rise and that the year 2015 looks more than promising for the young artist.",

It labels the work of two extremely dedicated dance producers, Jelle Hoogeveen and Roy Tosseram, who gave their career a promising lift-off in 2009 with the release of ‘Gold’ on Extrema Records. The track is a perfect reflection of the sound these guys represent, not just committed to one type of style, but combining several genres in the making of energetic clubtracks! \r\n\r\nLooking back at their youth, music has always been of strong influence on their life stories. Long before the DJ’ing part caught their interest, Jelle and Roy started out separately by studying music production on their own. At the age of only 9, Roy already mastered his first production skills on the early classic synthesizers, which let him to performing live on stage with dancers. On the other side, Jelle also made a start with electronic music at a young age, playing songs on his keyboard and in his teens by DJ’ing at local beach party’s. \r\n\r\nFor obvious, it was the music that brought Jelle and Roy together, not only as close friends but partners as well. In 2005 the two met each other at a dance party, and immediately found a connection of interest. It turned out the guys shared the same opinions about dance music and both were in search of new ways to become a part of the DJ-world. After spending some quality time in the studio, Jelle and Roy knew for certain that if they would take their chances for seizing their luck, it should be together as a team. \r\n\r\nOver the years, Jelle and Roy build a strong foundation for their DJ-career under the name Evil Apes. Inspired by the classic synthesizer sound from the early nineties, the duo started to produce tuneful house and trance music. Great studio techniques were skilled, but because both guys had to deal with other big responsibilities on the side, the real breakthrough wasn’t in sight yet. After a tough year in 2008, dealing with the loss of a close friend to an incurable disease, the time was right for a fresh new start. With the release of ‘Gold’, a warm trance production in dedication of their late friend Rutger, the Jasper Jinx project was born. Nowadays, Roy and Jelle still create their music with great passion, bringing uplifting ‘kick ass’ beats to shake up the big rooms!",

As such, he has recently been installed as resident there and has already warmed up for kingpins like Laurent Garnier and Michael Meyer, which is testament to his dexterous and flexible talents as a DJ. \r\n\r\nInfluential online magazine DJ Broadcast named the talented young DJ and producer as one to watch this year, and for good reason: the music set to be released on labels including Something Happening Somewhere is deep, paired down house with plenty of raw soul, analogue roughness and subtle synth work. Inspired by classy selectors including Move D and Gerd Janson and producers like Roman Flügel, rather than rushing out his first creations into the world, Tsepo has taken his time to really find his own sonic identity. Because of that they ooze real atmosphere and, alongside his considered DJ sets, are sure to win him many fans in the coming months.",

Apart from the by-no-means trifling matter of co-producing  house record – 51 Days’ ‘Paper Moon’ – he’s also been at the birth of the Trancesetters, the splendidly-named Tata Box Inhibitors, P.I.M.P., Loophole, Amfibian, Mindfunk and an ever-expanding list of inventively-spelt production credits. You’d wonder, looking at the fellow’s discography, whether he ever got any kip (we’ve been assured by his family that he does).\r\n\r\nJamez, for those that haven’t been paying attention, was part of a Dutch triumvirate – the other two being Dobre and DJ Zki – that helped transform European house music in the early 90s. Working closely with Dutch outfit Touché Records, they produced a series of consistently great singles of wildly differing styles ranging from the jazzy (Jamshed), deep (51 Days) and the acclaimed harder style of Tata Box Inhibitors and Trancesetters. While most UK DJ's looked to the US for new records, oddly, lots of American DJs – Danny Tenaglia being a particular fan – championed this new European style (Underworld’s Darren Emerson was also an early supporter of Touché’s releases).\r\n\r\nLike many a young European, Jamez was turned on to dance music via the burgeoning rap scene of the eighties, before hooking up with Dobre who, as luck would have it, had a small home-studio. Experiments in dance ensued. A meeting with DJ Zki at a radio station completed the Three Musketeers’ line-up. Early releases came out through fellow countryman Robin ‘Jaydee’ Albers’ First Impressions label, but it was through Touché Records – started with Dobre – that Jamez and his cohorts gained international recognition.\r\nBoth 51 Days’ mournful ‘Paper Moon’ and Trancesetters’ heavy-hitting ‘The Search’ were massive New York club hits. Plenty of others were staples in DJs’ boxes around the world, probably because Jamez has mastered the art of syncopated and punchy beats, mellifluous keyboards and catchy hooks. Soulful dance music, in other words. As a remixer, Jamez is no slouch, either, having turned in superb mixes of Paperclip People’s ‘The Climax’, X-Press 2’s strident ‘The Sound’, Humate's 'Choose Life' and a stunning rerub of Der Dritte Raum’s ‘Alienoid’, transforming it into a hypnotically textural house cut. The list goes on and on.\r\n\r\nAfter more than 100 releases on world class labels, numerous remixes and many appearances on compilations, he definetly put his mark down.\r\n\r\nAs a DJ he also did his part. Flying from one city to the other, keeping the crowds shouting for more. His mix of techno and tech house takes the listener on a journey through unknown territories, well known hights and deep smooth plains.\r\n\r\nAfter a well deserved sabbatical Jamez returned to the scene in 2008, where he hooked up with Soulboy. In the summer of 2009 Christian Smith (Smith & Selway) did a remix for Trancesetters 'The Search'. The track had big support from Hernan Cattaneo, James Zabiela, John Digweed and Adam Beyer. Together with Soulboy, they produced the track Surface Tension, which was in 2009 Kevin Saunderson's summers favourite and was frequently heard on Ibiza Global Radio. \r\nIn 2010 he started Repressure Recordings, together with Soulboy, Abdel and Gwen. The label became successful, releasing  beautiful EP's monthly. In 2012, he left Repressure, so he could re-start his label Rough Cut Records. This underground label that was brought to life in 1995, changed from vinyl to digital, but the sound remained. Raw, funky, soulful, distorted electronic music....",

Getting his hands on Richie Hawtin: Decks, EFX & 909 in the year 2000 there was no turning back.\r\n\r\nHe exchanged the Clubtrance records for Techno and started developing his own style. A style greatly influenced by a tribal techno sound from producers and innovators such as Ben Sims, Speedy J, Cristian Varela and James Ruskin.\r\n\r\nEarly in 2003 the transition to Minimal Techno & Clickhouse was made. A reaction ignited by pioneer Richie Hawtin, who paved the way for whoever was willing to listen. It was like falling in love with yet another style of music. Minimalistic House soon started to complement his already rapidly growing record collection.\r\n\r\nBy the end of that same year Jason started organizing his own parties in and around The Hague together with his musical companions, Pieter Ridder, William K. Djoko and Newton da Costa. In that time Jason and Newton were a B2B duo playing numerous parties through out Holland.\r\n\r\nSummer of ’04: it was time for a change. Jason decided, together with the three afore mentioned friends, to combine DJ’ing with live elements. It was the first stage of creating of their very own live-act: Jason & the Argonauts, taking up all available time and a lot of effort.\r\n\r\nWithin two years since their great investment, they’ve developed themselves into one of the key Minimal acts in the Netherlands. Next to their appearances at stages like Voltt, Mono, Phonocult, Rockit, Less=More the four also acquired a residency at the Magnetronik-nights held at Club Poema.\r\n\r\nAlthough heavily committed to the live-act, Jason is still discovering new ways to expressing himself through playing hisvinyls. Jason Shae’s DJ sets can be described as French Funk, Chicago House with a hint of Berlin stripped down house. Due to the use of Serato he can easily combine material from the boys of Jason & the Argonauts with records from other artists. \r\n",

It is by playing all these warm-up sets Jamie really began to understand how to enchant a crowd throughout the night and keep them interested, resulting in playing long sets exceeding closing hours.\r\n\r\nAt the moment Jamie is working on several projects including his own clubnight called ‘WAVES’ in which he carries out the same philosophy as in his own dj sets: not a continuous build-up until eventually all energy has been spilled, but sets that captivate the crowd full of highs and depths, wave after wave. \r\n\r\nFor the near future releases are expected on high quality underground labels such as Tzinah Records, Arupa and Moral Fiber.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jamielieakwie.nl \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/jamielieakwieofficial https://soundcloud.com/jamielieakwie",

  "artist_bio": "Nijmegen is the home base of Jayton, it is within the Nijmegen dance scene a welcome guest and not unknown. In six years, his style evolved into a deep and warm Chigaco and Detroithouse sound, with a touch of acid and dubtechno. He always tries to find his own way in the music and that is usually a bit deeper than what others go.Nijmegen is the home base of Jayton, it is within the Nijmegen dance scene a welcome guest and not unknown. In six years, his style evolved into a deep and warm Chigaco and Detroithouse sound, with a touch of acid and dubtechno. He always tries to find his own way in the music and that is usually a bit deeper than what others go.\r\n\r\nThe love for dance music began at the age of 10 when he heard for the first time heard the music from De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest and Tony Scott. At an age of 14 could the music not be hard enough and he discovered the Dutch hardcore scene. After his first festival as a visitor in 1996, he was completely sold and traveled across the country for parties, to end in 1999 at Sporthallen Zuid Amsterdam during Shocker his first techno party. Here he heard for the first time how great techno was thanks to acts like Remy and Green Velvet. Shortly afterwards he visited the Planet Rose evenings at Doornroosje in Nijmegen, where he still is a loyal visitor to.\r\n\r\nIn late 2001 he bought his first turntables and mixer to practice in his bedroom and started to collect vinyl. In the beginning it was especially hard techno provided by the speakers around him. Over time, he discovered the wonderful world of Detroittechno and focusing entirely on that. Since that time, his style goes deeper and warmer. In 2004 he is still mainly oriented to the Detroittechno but more from artist from Europe, as Vince Watson, Aril Brikha and Djinxx, they brought their exquisite melodies for him. Since 2007 he is going to play more music that feels good about the whole body, by deep and heavy bass lines. This is increasingly the direction he went in the house especially the sound of U.S.A. soil. The records that will be played by Jayton now days are from artists like DJ Jus-ed, Patrice Scott, Abe Duque, Blake Baxter, Lerosa etc.\r\n\r\nJayton's first performances were at parties that were organized by friends. In 2004 he participated in the Planet Rose DJ contest for the first time he played at a location that run its traces in the Dutch techno scene for many years and where he comes several years as a visitor. That is the dream of every novice dj, but it was for him a great disaster. The nerves and those “oh-so-fine master” of the djm 600 set a disaster. Fortunately he got a another change from Darko Esser to play on other Planet Rose evenings to prove his own talent and made it finally for the first time in 2006 at the mainstage. He stood there as warming-up for Isis and Djinx. Since that time, he has played at various other parties rotated in Nijmegen as Drift, Deeplay, Mood Elevator and Lust. His best action so far is the latest Planet Rose of the 2007 season where Michael Mayer became father and that Jayton with Monokreck back to back and Aril Brikha 2 hours Live had to replace him. What was that one hell of a night. Recently runs Jayton as resident on the monthly Progressive City at the Billabong in Nijmegen. He will be here once every two months on a Thursday evening to spread his musical preferences.",

A man with a mission, steered by the Gods, got together with all the hero’s of his time went on a life’s adventure to forfill his destiny. The myth is symbolic for brotherhood and cherishing a life’s dream in an eternal existence.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind four friends decided to honour this symbolic value and bring it back to life in the summer of 2004. A second Jason and the Argonauts (J&A) spawned for a shared pupose: creating a live-act en letting everyone know they’re there.\r\n\r\nIn 2005 they renewed their setup and changed this again and again many times. From playing with 3 laptops, a Machinedrum and FX for vocals they’ve now found themselves in a setup combining 4 laptops and a mic. Throughout the whole Holland they’ve played many and very diverse venues & locations. Abroad partypeople in Belgium, (Northern) Ireland and Germany have danced to their grooves at different clubs & festivals.\r\n\r\nProduction wise this project brings out the best in all of the bandmembers. Both soloreleases aswell as elaborate collaborations have brought some fine releases. As J&A you will find several netreleases en two nice rmx’s which have been received very well by both dutch and international artists.\r\n\r\nTo get a good understanding of what they sound like during a performance the guys recommend yu to come and see for yourself: “Our live-act is best experienced live. It combines sounds and some showelements with live interaction with the crowd, thriving it to a peak with loads of energy. Not to vague of a concept like you see a lot these days but concrete deep-going beats brought with a lot of fun/pleasure. Entertainment, if you will.”\r\n\r\nOne thing’s for certain: Jason and the Argonauts is an act that guarantees an energyboost for everybody, stimulating both visual and auditory senses!!\r\n\r\nJason and the Argonauts consists of:\r\nJason Shae, Pete Bandit, Newton da Costa and William Kouam Djoko\r\n\r\nCollaborations formed in J&A:\r\nBandit&Shae (DJ)\r\nLe Chien Perdu (Live) [Karat, CATWASH)\r\nWilliam Kouam Djoko (Live&DJ) [ThirtyOneTwenty, Quagmire]",

Even before he’s a DJ, he already bought lots of (House) records, searched for new music and could always be found at the clubs.\r\n\r\nWatching his good friends Real El Canario and Melly Mel spin and produce, Jay-B was getting more and more inspired and motivated to get into the scene. They taught him how to spin and a new talent was born. Influenced by both House (Melly Mel) and Hiphop (Real el Canario), Jay-B doesn’t want to stick to one style. He rather keeps his sets as varied as possible.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, when the owner of Hotel Arena asked him to DJ in the restaurant, his career started off. It wouldn’t take long before people discovered his talent.\r\nSoon after his first performance at Hotel Arena he’s been asked to become the resident DJ of the famous ‘Sappig’ nights in the Sinners.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Jay-B has already rocked every high-quality-club in Amsterdam. He played his eclectic sets of House, R&B, Classics and Hip-Hop at venues as diverse as Panama, The Zebra, Sinners, The Mansion, Hotel Arena, Club Rain and Escape. By now Jay-B had become one of the most in-demand DJs in Amsterdam and is getting more and more popular in the rest of Holland. Jay-B is the resident DJ of one of the hottest clubs in Amsterdam: The Zebra. Besides that, he is also the resident of Sappig, Rich, Samsobeats and his own concept Eclectic Fantastic. Jay-B knows exactly how to tear up the dancefloors and sets the clubs on fire with his playful and energetic dj sets. There is much more to be expected from this new talent!\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "It's not just the individual records that matter. It's the moment they meet in a DJ-set. That fleeting, one of a kind space in between. When something almost impossible to grasp forms, just for a short while. Only to vanish again, remaining in the minds of those around.It’s this feeling that drew Amsterdam-based DJ and producer Jeff Rushin to techno and what has kept him there since. In a career that now spans over two decades, he’s played throughout Europe, hitting smaller clubs, major venues and global festivals alike. Always looking to experiment with a wide range of sounds, a Rushin-set aims is warm, energetic and different every time.\r\n\r\nAs a producer, Jeff is faithful to techno’s rhythmic machine-roots while also allowing emotion and atmosphere to slip through. His records are made for the dancefloor as well as the mind. He has dropped releases on a number of imprints including Weekend Circuit, his own On and On Records and the infamous Mote Evolver, his tracks getting picked up by numerous international DJ’s.\r\n\r\nTo top it all off, Jeff’s also the driving, creative mind behind the respected On and On events, which have become engrained within Amsterdam’s busy nightlife scene. Eager to play, in search of those unique moments once more.",

One of the first of its kind in the Netherlands, Highland Beats has inspired many labels and artists over the years. \r\n\r\nJan’s DJ career started off in the underground techno scene. Together with some friends he organised parties in crazy industrial locations like old abandoned farm houses, fields, tunnels and warehouses. \r\n\r\nJan’s musical taste differed from what most people were playing and he soon made a name for himself due to his musical diversity and refreshingly different sets. \r\n\r\nThe popularity of Highland Beats fuelled his success and his first international bookings soon followed. \r\n\r\nIn 2003 Jan released his first co-production. This led to a storm of remix requests and he has since (co-)produced on many prolific labels. \r\n\r\nThe main reason that Jan has remained a sought after DJ is that he doesn’t let any trend dictate what he plays while still evolving and progressing. \r\n\r\nAfter 40 releases on Highland Beats and several releases on sub labels HBLTD, Body:Art:Form and Klirfactor Jan decided to start up a new, fresh project to reflect the sound he is playing at the moment. \r\n\r\n2008 saw the launch of Eterno Records, a joint project with partner Jenny Rose. \r\n\r\nJan Liefhebber has performed in Austria, Belgium, Brasil, Croatia, Turkey, France, the UK, USA, Ireland, Italy, Slovenia, Germany, Malta, Japan, Spain, Switzerland, Poland and Russia at some of the world’s most prolific events. \r\n\r\n",

Memories got great response from names like Josh Wink, Onsulade and Laurent Garnier.\r\n\r\nNowadays Jarno is working hard to get his production skills on a higher level and making new tracks and remixes for different labels. Beside this he’s involved in the development of an interactive dancefloor laser installation, together with Patrice Bäumel and Nuno dos Santos.",

  "cover_photo": "",
  "artist_bio": "After developing a more focused interest in house and techno, Joris invested in the versatile MC-303 Groovebox and began to experiment with synth sounds and drumloops.Joris Voorn is a record producer and Dj from Rotterdam, Netherlands. Raised in a musical family, music naturally became an intrinsic part of Voorn's life from an early age. Electronic music first caught his attention in the mid-90's, and he started DJ'ing in 1997. \r\n\r\nBy the end of 2000 Joris began building a small studio to produce his own music, which led to his first release\r\ncalled 'muted trax pt.1' on Keynote. His first EP was massive success, filling the record boxes of Carl Craig,\r\nLaurent Garnier, DJ Rush and Technasia. In 2003 'Lost memories Pt.1' was released on Technasia's SINO label\r\nand was followed by 'Lost memories Pt.2' containing the anthem 'Incident' which was heard on dancefloors\r\naround the world.\r\n\r\nAfter the success of 'Incident', Voorn released his debut cd album called 'Future History' on the Sino label.\r\nEncompassing 3 years of ideas and inspiration, the cd contains 20 diverse tracks, a seamless soundscape that\r\nrepresents his arrival as one of the most relevant techno producers of this time.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2005 Joris Voorn's new personal outlet called 'green' saw the light of day. 'A dedicated mind'\r\nwas released as the first EP, which garnered success globally. He also completed his debut DJ mix CD for the\r\nFuse club in Belgium. After Dave Clarke, DJ Hell and Technasia, Fuse presented Joris Voorn to mix part 4 of their\r\ninternational resident's dj mix albums. The mix contained over 40 tracks of timeless techno music mixed with the\r\nhelp of Ableton Live for its endless mixing and editing possibilities.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 the sophomore release under Voorn's Green label, named 'MPX_309', was a crossover techno work that\r\nwas played out by techno, minimal, house and trance DJs. During the same year Voorn created his second\r\nalbum, released worldwide in June 2007. This new piece of work called 'From a deep place' featured many\r\ndifferent styles of electronic music, ranging from atmospheric interludes to broken beats, house and deep soulful\r\ntechno.\r\n\r\nThe focus point of the 'From a deep place' CD has been the listener rather than the dancer and was received\r\nenthusiastically by the electronic music community. Some of the works were edited to more dj friendly tracks for\r\nthe vinyl release of the album. During the summer of 2007 Joris has been touring with his new live performance in\r\nsupport of his album release.\r\n\r\nMore recently, Joris has been focusing on collaborative efforts producing remixes for respected and diverse artists\r\nsuch as Robert Babicz, Nic Fanciulli, Slam, Steve Angello, Sebo K and Jerome Sydenham. The 'Dark Flower\r\nMagnolia Mix' for Robert Babicz turned out to be another summer anthem in electronic dance music, and was a\r\nfavourite of DJ's like Sven Vath, Dubfire, Pete Tong and John Digweed among many others.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, following the success of his resident advisor podcast, Joris was invited to produce episode 14 of the\r\nBalance DJ mix CD series from Australia. Following in the footsteps of James Holden and Lee Burridge, Joris\r\nconstructed a layered and seamless mix of electronic dance music on a double CD. An epic mix in the very best\r\nsense of the word, Balance 014 achieves the rare feat of combining variety and consistency, making it perfect for\r\ntrainspotters and dancers alike. The tracks change quickly and quietly, but the groove stays. An accompanying\r\nworld tour will follow where Joris will bring the essence of this studio project to the stage, using all different\r\nelements of the mix into a full range club experience.\r\n\r\nHaving established himself as a leading producer and DJ, Joris will be embarking on a new project called 'A green\r\nnight'. Inspired by his surroundings, which is never limited to the dancefloor, Joris and his team will be creating a\r\nnight in several festivals and clubs, exploring the possibilities of combining music and visual arts. This year the\r\nproject will be developed, tested and finetuned in selected clubs.\r\n\r\nAs a DJ and live performer Joris Voorn has joined an elite group of international DJ's whose musical talent has\r\nacquired global appeal. He has performed across Europe, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Singapore, Austsralia,\r\nRussia, Brazil, Colombia, Israel, Detroit, Chicago and New York.\r\n\r\nRejected:\r\nTogether with friend Edwin Oosterwal the 'Rejected' record label was established at the end of 2006. Their first\r\nEP as Rejected featured the two tracks 'SL3' and 'Cliché' and became an instant success and was played out by\r\nalmost every self-respecting DJ around the globe. With Rejected, Joris is working on a more club oriented\r\ncontemporary sound instead of deep electronic music excursions.\r\n\r\nIn mid 2007 their second EP was released, featuring a crossover techhouse track called 'Let's go juno' and a\r\ndriving minimal track called 'Lost'. Both tracks appealed to a wide audience and established Rejected's name\r\neven more.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 the two key tracks 'Let's go juno' and 'Cliché' were successfully remixed by dutch artists District One and\r\nPolder on one EP.\r\n\r\nThis year, the Rejected label has some great projects in the pipeline, to start off with a disco infected house track\r\nby the Dutch rising star Pitto.",

After buying his first house and techno records in 1987, it didn't take long until Jilt van Moorst (aka Robotfunk) started DJing and producing his own music, leading to his first live performance in 1991.\r\n\r\nPurely by accident he rolled into his first VJ gig at a party in Berlin in 1994. Jilt decided visuals could make an interesting addition to his live show, but remained dissatisfied with the limited possibilities of integrating visuals to with the music in a coherent way.\r\n\r\nThe next years he kept doing audiovisual and purely visual sets to discover how far you could go with the music-visual integration. After being involved with the development of various VJ softwares he set out to write the tool he needed in his own performances to make visuals respond to the music, leading to the release of Flowmotion in 2001, which has since then been used by VJs and audiovisual artitsts worldwide.\r\n\r\nMusically always looking to explore boundaries and experiment, yet remaining very danceable.",

As a result, Joran consecutively signed EP’s to Richie’s Minus and Dubfire’s SCI+TEC. This all happened shortly after Joran’s track ‘Untitled 2’ was signed to Minus12 and appeared on Richie Hawtin’s MixMag cover mount compilation.\r\n\r\nBoth Hawtin & Dubfire open their sets with Joran’s instant classic ‘Faded’ on a regular basis and the list of well-established dj’s and producers (whom he considers to be his peers) that support him continues to grow. He keeps on sharing his music with people like Joris Voorn and many others, who all recognize his talent immediately.\r\n\r\nBut it’s not only because of his efforts in the studio Joran van Pol is the one to watch. Also when it comes to dj’ing, Joran van Pol shows us time and time again he knows his stuff. Whether he is performing at Awakenings or in an intimate club in Paris, Joran always knows the right records to pull out of his bag to get the dance-floor going in exactly the direction he wants it to: ecstatic and longing for more when he plays the last track.\r\nSurely all this praise and attention for Joran van Pol is not without reason. Extraordinary talent when it comes to dj’ing, astonishing production skills and perhaps most importantly, his positive attitude are all things Joran has got going for him. Exactly these qualities are probably why he finds himself taken under the wings of Dubfire and Richie Hawtin. It won’t be long now until Joran van Pol takes the electronic music scene by storm himself.\r\nIt is safe to say 2013 will be Joran van Pol’s definite breakthrough year, so don’t let Joran out of your sight if you want to join him on his adventure.",

It was his opportunity to show his true talent in front of 1400 people, which succeeded. This resulted into many performances in clubs such as ‘Off-Corso’, ‘Outland’ (now Eclipse), ‘Club Zonder Concessies’ and more.\r\n\r\nNow, Johnny Flores is on an adventure as he moved to Miami to continue his DJ career and gain international experience. He already gained trust of Miami Based record label ‘Yaris Records’, which released his to Miami dedicated production ‘Deep 305’. Johnny Flores is driven to also succeed in Miami and conquer the hearts of the Miami crowd and clubs. But with his talent, time is the only thing keeping him from doing so.\r\n\r\nHe’s young, he’s talented and he’s creative: he’s Johnny Flores!",

This is the first thing you notice when you see the two of them performing. Friendship and fun is the key element in their gigs. The two of them have witnessed too many dj’s that take themselves too seriously behind the decks. You will always hear this duo say that interaction with the people in the audience is critical to a good set. It makes an evening fun and therefore more memorable.\r\n\r\nThis doesn’t mean that the people that see them play have to trade in good music to get a little bit of a show. Jop and Jordi want to give you both. Over the years they spent many  nights staying up and discussing music. They are tuned in to each other’s preferences concerning dance music. Of course they don’t listen to exactly the same stuff. But their tastes have definitely grown towards each other. Both have learned to adapt, finding a perfect middle ground. This way, the listener gets the best of two worlds, the best of their musical tastes combined. Some people call it house, others speak of techno. Jop and Jordi don’t care if it’s called Industrial Psy Bubblin, they only distinguish the good music from the bad.\r\n\r\nThis year, the two of them have started producing music together as well. Both are very optimistic about the results and they hope to send their music your way as soon as possible. Come see them at their gigs. Make friends with them and ask them for a shot of vodka: they always carry a bottle or more with them behind the decks.",

  "artist_bio": "MC, DJ, Organizer summerdanceforever (Festival Paradiso)/Juste-debout Netherlands (Paradiso), NightOwls (Residence SugarFactory)John Agesilas is one of the founders of jazz-fusion, as both a dancer and choreographer.\r\nJohn Agesilas was born in 1970 in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, and came to Amsterdam, the Netherlands in 1986. With a Ghanaian mother and a French father, the drums of African music, the sound of jazz, and the flow of disco and funk were all prevalent throughout his childhood. However, it was not until he discovered the culture of hip hop and its pioneering break dancing that John became a dancer, at the age of 13. By the time he was 18 years old, John had become one of the founding members of the jazz dance group AJDJazz and later became a member of the ‘Southern Roots Jazz Dancers’, a collective of jazz dancers who are still performing all over Europe today.\r\n\r\nJohn’s ambitions have no limits and his impeccable talent got him to choreograph and tour internationally with major artists such as the Pointer Sisters, Jocelyn Brown, Sister Sledge, Metropole Orchestra, New Cool Collective and Donna Summer, just to name a few. Aside from a broad roster of artists with whom John performed, he also holds an extensive resume that includes all major Dutch music festivals, TV shows, commercials, clubs, fashion shows, magazines and noteworthy gigs such as choreographing Amsterdam Arena’s Bollywood opening performance. In light of the above, it is obvious that John has given a remarkable contribution to the world of dance on both the Dutch and international dance scene.\r\nFurther expanding his career, John was also able to create opportunities in the corporate world, becoming one of the leading choreographers to produce fashion shows for brands such as Nike, Adidas, Vivienne Westwood, Evisu, Bjorn Borg and Paul Smith. He was also one of the first dancers in his genre to introduce a ground breaking jazz dance act to the theatre. Produced in collaboration with Mojo Theatres, John debuted his self-directed and produced jazz act ‘Intrepertationzz’, a theatre show of different urban dance styles on jazz music. The show went from being a performance at Amsterdam’s characteristic nightclub Panama into a full sized ensemble, of eighteen members including a live band, who went touring around Europe.\r\n\r\nWith devotion and dedication to dance, John is one of the few people who has been able to recognise career potential with dance and music in other industries, which by traditional standards could be considered unconventional. It is therefore not strange that he found his way into the music industry, excelling as a renowned MC and becoming one of the founding members of ‘Risk Sound System’ (RSS), a three man DJ collective with a goal to promote and preserve ‘real’ house music and deep soulful house culture worldwide. With RSS, John has collaborated with like-minded DJs and producers such as Kenny Dope, Kerry Chandler, At Jazz, Mr V, and Louis Vega. Producing two number one house hits: ‘The Sound Is Yours’ remix (Kerry Chandler) and ‘Grow’ featuring At Jazz, reaching number 13 in Africa’s House Music top 100. Their success has also led the RSS collective to become a collaborating partner of the Dutch music festival ADE (Amsterdam Dance Event), as DJs and bookers.\r\n\r\nAlthough still teaching at Amsterdam’s School for the Performing Arts AHK/5 O’Clock and Ballet Academy Lucia Marthas, John always searched for other ways to contribute to the world of dance. It was persistence, hard work and passion for his art form that led John to contracting with the world’s biggest dance battle event: ‘Juste Debout’. John became the franchise holder and organizer for the Netherlands in 2009 and the host of not just the Dutch edition but also the French finals in Paris. ‘Juste Debout’ further spurred his career as a businessman, becoming one of Holland’s most relevant promoters as he spawned off his own dance festival ‘Summer Dance FOREVER’, of which he is artistic director and host. With a simple yet unique formula to the battle culture, where finalists battle against judges, his festival also cultivated and rejuvenated the level of dancers in the Netherlands.\r\nJohn has a distinct vision for the future of dance and his philosophy with FOREVER is unblemished. It’s about bringing back the social aspect to the dance floor and battling culture, the way John experienced it years ago. With FOREVER he aims to put house culture back on the map and reintroduce the importance and relevance of DJs, who are the foundation of dance culture. It are the DJs who are largely responsible for the success of his FOREVER events. “We often forget where things started or loose awareness on how this culture is a tool for social change. I want to bring back this awareness and show that hip hop culture is just as relevant in the theatre as it is in the streets”.\r\n\r\nLooking back at 30 years of accomplishments one could say that with FOREVER John is in some way coming full circle, as he takes it back to where it all began. Concluding that hip hop didn’t change his life, it started it!",

Idiosyncratic and completely caught up in the waves of the underground electronic music techno music. Jesse Ten is forever in rapture of different sounds, rhythms, and depths. Seeking forever a balance between the base and the extraordinary. This is what categorizes him the most by often looking for a way to educate the crowd with sounds and tracks that aren’t very familiar to the bigger mass.",

Some call him a music maniac.\r\n\r\nMaybe it’s because he has his tentacles in so many different areas of the music industry; Having his own radio show ‘Adapt to this!’ on several radio stations world-wide, hosting his own festival “Trix in the Mix” twice a year in his home town Den Bosch, dj-ing, producing and running his labels Adapt Recordings and Cutbrook.Half Danish, half Dutch, but always 100% dedicated... Some call him a music maniac.\r\n\r\nMaybe it’s because he has his tentacles in so many different areas of the music industry; Having his own radio show ‘Adapt to this!’ on several radio stations world-wide, hosting his own festival “Trix in the Mix” twice a year in his home town Den Bosch, dj-ing, producing and running his labels Adapt Recordings and Cutbrook. \r\n\r\nStill doesn’t ring a bell? Let us further introduce Jorgensen:\r\n\r\nHe got struck with the Dance virus in the early 90’s and immediately started organizing club nights. \r\nFrom there it was just a small effort to step behind the decks himself, where he quickly established himself as a well respected DJ spinning memorable sets. In the studio Jorgensen is equally as passionate. \r\n\r\nHis first release “Untitled” got picked up straight away by Toolroom Records. Ever since he has been producing and remixing for labels such as: Spinnin, Toolroom, Purple Music, Caballero and his own label Adapt of course. With over 200 releases on Beatport and multiple compilations, he is even more dedicated than the day he started!\r\n\r\nHis skills are not limited to producing. He is also a highly skilled DJ, performing for crowds all over the world. Clubs, festivals, no crowd is safe for the energy he unleashes. He has a way of connecting with the audience and taking them on an intense journey through cutting edge grooves, with only one goal: crowd satisfaction! \r\n\r\nJorgensen has raised the bar yet again for 2012 with his own label Adapt Recordings. He wants to take a new yet revived approach to electronic dance music as a DJ and producer. He recently quoted: \r\n\r\n“ We receive so many outstanding productions each day, that me and the Adapt Team decided to do more releases on a monthly basis, with quality house music from the respected names and new kids pulling the wagon for a new generation! I wanted to create a label that embraced the spirit of electronic dance music in the late 80’s. An era in which music wasn’t pigeon-holed constantly and DJ’s were versatile and eclectic. And so far we did goooooood! ”\r\n\r\nIn 2012 Adapt Recordings will provide you with even more outstanding releases by: Filthy Rich, Belocca, Darko de Jan, Mike Newman, RiddimJunkies, Frashad Kay and more exciting, promising and established names in the world of tech house…",

It didn’t took him a long time to make his dream come true. He started in a small studio of a friend in Amsterdam. He played a little, mixed a little and finally he accomplished a spark and made a sound to bring up the heat. First he showed his friends, in that same little studio, that he didn’t need much to let them feel his love for producing music. After that, he participates in a few DJ-contests. Here, he realised that being on stage and see how the crowed was touch by his sounds, gave him the ultimate feeling of happiness. He was so enthusiastic about music and especially making music that he signed up for the SAE electronic music production (EMP) and after that he did the course of Audio Engineering in AVA studio’s Hilversum.  ?His first Remix New York immediately got released on the label PM deep(NL). \r\nRecently he has play at different places on the world like:\r\nOutland ( Rotterdam-NL),Lucky (Rijssen-NL),The Rain (Amsterdam-NL),NDSM Stubnitz (Amsterdam-NL),Club Storm (Utrecht-NL),Club Rozes (Amsterdam-NL),Club Vroeger (Bloemendal-NL),Podium (Cali-Colombia),Club Oz (Cali-Colombia),Privilege(Cali-Colombia),Port Forum (Barcelona-Spain),Festival 2010,(Esparreguera - Spain),Montmagastrik Festival (Arteza -Spain),The Pub (Esterri- Spain),The Hort (Olesa-Spain)...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

By now he has become a key figure in Dutch nightlife, a trusted provider of acclaimed sets, having played nearly every club and festival imaginable.\r\n\r\n2015, however, is Joey’s international breakthrough year, by taking the leap that every DJ secretly dreams of: his first big gigs in Ibiza. It is also the year where a ten years worth of gigs both in his home country as well as abroad, experience in curating and hosting top-quality events and an ever-growing appetite for the studio are now culminating into Joey’s greatest chapter yet. And it’s only just begun.\r\n\r\nHis early beginnings are known to many of his close friends and loyal fans: putting his skill to the test at Rotterdam’s famous warehouse parties. Quickly gathering experience in Rotterdam’s nightlife, Daniel would later be adopted by one of Holland’s most forefront nightclubs, Toffler. At Toffler, he would later also become a resident, putting enough trust in Joey’s capabilities to grant him an all-nighter twice a year, and has been doing so for four years now. During these marathon sets - sometimes even lasting ten hours - in Rotterdam’s neon-laden dance temple, Joey would come to truly understand what it is that fuels him as a DJ and how he can take complete control of a crowd.\r\n\r\n“I’m a sucker for the low-end, dubby tech spectrum of dance music. That’s why bass always plays a key role in my sets”, Joey says of his musical tastes. Just add the driving percussion elements, especially the subtle hi-hat and snare elements to that and you get an idea of what you’re in for when you have Joey Daniel playing in front of you.\r\n\r\nToffler is also the main venue where his 300MPH parties take place; a successful series of events still in existence today, aimed at bringing some of the finest craftsmen in house and techno to his hometown, curating nights directed at highlighting big names such as Loco Dice. Not before long, though, he decided it was time to set out for his conquest of Amsterdam, resulting in a more than welcome addition to the city’s sprawling nightlife roster: DSTRCT. The crowd in the Dutch capital immediately welcomed the warehouse-themed event with a near sold-out first edition. Aside from his Rotterdam adventures and his own parties, Joey is also recognised for his legendary performances at Awakenings, Time Warp Holland, Mysteryland, Welcome To The Future, Pollerwiesen Festival across the border with Germany, Extrema Outdoor in Belgium and a gig at the much acclaimed Elrow Barcelona.\r\n\r\nJoey is also getting the hang of the studio and record production more and more. His first release, “You Know My Streez” in 2012, dropped on Material, was an instant hit, reaching the top 10 Beatport charts and extensive playtime by none other than Loco Dice. Another release, “Pantys All Over The Place”, followed in 2013 and was released on Memoria and gained massive support from Loco Dice and Matthias Tanzmann.\r\n\r\nThis summer Joey is coming out with a range of new studio material. One single has been dropped with good friend Rub A Dub called “Jungle Stabbin”, on a Various Artists EP of one of Joey’s favourite labels, D-Floor (run by Leon, Pirupa and NiCe7’s). Another collab single with Rub A Dub is coming up on a VA of upcoming Parisian imprint InMotion, followed by a full collab EP by Joey and Rub A Dub on that same label. Next to this, there’s also a solo single of him, “Crossing Borders”, to be released on the upcoming Summer Sampler on NoExcuse, Rub A Dub’s own label. If that weren’t enough, Joey has got a multitude of solo EPs coming up on various labels – more info on that is following soon..\r\n\r\nIt didn’t come as a surprise though, that Joey was soon to fully focus on his DJ career again – specifically his international aspirations. Regarding this, 2015 has already been an incredible year for him, with bookings that took him across the globe. Like playing at sunrise during one of the most spellbinding after parties during The BPM Festival in Mexico last January, or his upcoming gig at Berlin’s revered Watergate club. More importantly though, it is the year Joey is granted the possibility to prove himself in Ibiza.\r\n\r\nAfter playing various high-profile after- and villa parties on the White Isle back in the 2014 season, Joey got picked up by Music On. This brought forth one of Joey’s most defining moments: playing at Music On in a packed Amnesia, next to life long idols of his like Joseph Capriati, Hector, Stacey Pullen and of course head honcho Marco Carola himself. A moment engraved in his memory forever, where all he had worked for finally came together.\r\n\r\nSince then he’s been taken up by the Music On family and booking agency, Orbeat Bookings, actively supporting Joey’s DJ career from now on. This has immediately led to many great bookings, like playing the popular Music On radio show at Ibiza Global Radio, its official pre party at Café Del Mar and the official after party with Joseph Capriati at the magical outdoor venue Cova Santa. Next to that, other gigs followed at Space Ibiza during the celebrated Elrow parties and one at the Love The Underground label night at Tox, Destino.",

He’s talking about techno’s most engaging new talent, Joop Junior, and of course he is a man who knows. As such it’s no surprise the Minus boss has snapped up the Dutchman when Joop was only 21, and released two of his tracks on the label’s New Horizons compilation in 2012, as well as the Sonus.1 EP in 2013.\r\n\r\nHis Itanimulli EP, on Dubfire’s equally influential SCI+TEC label, followed that landmark release.  The reason? Joop Junior’s music is all carefully sculpted from scratch, with every sound synthesized by the Hague man with gorgeous synthetic textures, uplifting rhythms and plenty of the elegance associated with the best minimal has to offer.  It’s moody and atmospheric music that transports you to another realm entirely and earlier releases have been supported by the likes of Adam Beyer, Umek and John Digweed.\r\n\r\nIn the club Joop Junior deals exclusive in live shows. They help him transmit his message in the most personal way possible and see him working sounds into his own unique and exceptional sonic tapestries. He plays at esteemed places like London’s EGG, Air in Amsterdam plus festivals like Awakenings and Metropolis as well as many other cities around the world, sometimes alongside the Minus and SCI+TEC bosses that have been quick to showcase their man to the world.  Now he is here, he has plenty to say and an ever-larger audience of people who are desperate to listen in.",

  "artist_bio": "DJ, event organizer, label owner, bookings agent, artist management and music lover.Experienced is the word that comes to mind when you think about Jerry. He bought his first 12” at the age of 13. By then it was the end of the disco era and the beginning of electronic dance music in general. Experimenting with 1 turntable and a cassette player he was soon making his first mixes in his bedroom for the next couple of years.\r\n\r\nLater in the eighties he started djing in local clubs and soon was building a name for himself with the help of handing out monthly mix tapes to everybody which he called “The Groove Collection”. At this time his style was already different from most other dj’s. True underground music is what he played and he soon discovered the new sound that was coming from the UK after hearing the first Renaissance album mixed by Sasha & John Digweed. In the nineties he played for several famous Dutch organizations like Extrema, Earth and had gigs in Ibiza, Belgium and Asia.\r\n\r\nAfter djing for over 10 years he launched a website/forum called “The Groove Collection” (forum.groovecollection.nl), named after the mixtapes and later on cd’s that thousands of people had enjoyed over the years. It soon became a huge success with loads of members talking about forward thinking electronic underground dance music. On this site you can find cd- and vinyl-reviews, partypictures and members can win guestlists, cd’s and hardware. Soon The Groovecollection parties followed in Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 Jerry started some records labels (Groovecollection Records Black, Red and Originals) together with Peter van Hal (Extrema, Deep, Focus) so he could show his excellent taste in dance music again. Soon other labels came on board. Now with his own “Groovecollection Records”, “Deep”, “Focus”, Eelke Kleijn’s “Outside The Box Music”, Kosmas Epsilon’s “Epsilon Trax”, Randall Jones’ “Mynt Music” and more to follow like labels from Logiztik Sounds, Olav Basoski and Sebastian Davidson\r\n\r\nIn 2011 he started another company. The only thing missing at The Groove Collection was a dj agency. Groovecollection Bookings is an international operating bookings agency for dj’s/producers (www.groovecollectionbookings.com).\r\n\r\nFor several years Jerry is a resident dj at the famous Club NL in the center of Amsterdam. Together with Paul Sparkes he organizes a very successful monthly event called Floorplay (www.floorplay.nl).",

RAM ?RAMsterdam' or Andain's ?Beautiful Things' are just two highlights among a series of successful remixes.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 Jorn van Deynhoven met the Dutch artist RAM. Both noticed that they had the same idea and philosophy of music and so they decided to produce a single together. RAMsterdam was the first result. When the single was licensed to Armada Music the course was set for the candidate of “Tune of the year 2009”. With success. RAMsterdam entered Pos. 08 at the A State of Trance ?Tune of the Year'-Show.\r\n\r\nFor more than 12 weeks RAMsterdam has been on top of all important worldwide sales shops and so part of many popular DJ playlists.\r\n\r\nWorld's No1. DJ Armin van Buuren even nominated Jorn's composition Ramsterdam as biggest tune and mentioned him also as ?New Talent of Trance' on his ?Universal Religion Chapter 4' CD-Booklet.\r\n\r\nAlready in the same year Jorn van Deynhoven decided to spend more time on his DJ career starting his own radio show “Spotlight” on Afterhours.fm as well as diverse guest mixes on shows like:\r\n\r\n• A State of Trance #450\r\n\r\n• Tiesto's ClubLife #096\r\n\r\n• Vonyc Sessions / Vonyc Radio\r\n\r\n• Solaris International (formally Deep Blue Radio)\r\n\r\n• Dave Pearce Radio\r\n\r\n• Captured Radio\r\n\r\n• Sunshine-Live Germany\r\n\r\n• Kiss.FM Ukraine",

Now living and spinning in Amsterdam he's ready to take you on a journey of adventurous and almost fantasy like deep house, paving it’s own path with some melodic techno bends to check in to reality from time to time.From when Joris Bay was a teenager he was already interested in house music. But after partying in the summer of 2009 in Spain he then came back to Holland. Going back to the same old clubs, with the same old DJ’s he thought: I can definitely do this better. That being said he started mixing himself. Which quickly lead to a local gig. After a gig with almost no audience but with a professional DJ set and loud speakers he fell in love. That was the moment that clarified to work hard for a DJ set himself.\r\n\r\nWith finally having one he went to Berlin, the techno capital of the world, to be living there for 6 months. Living and clubbing in Berlin made him discover and fall in love with a deeper sound. This deeper sound in combination with his Dutch roots result in a unique way! This sound has led Joris Bay to play at places like Sausalitos(Berlin), Studio K(Amsterdam), Beachclub Indigo(Scheveningen), L.A.N.X.(Amsterdam) and Andere Koek(Schagen). The main goal for Joris at his gigs is to bring the vibe of summer in Berlin to The Netherlands!",

There he witnessed the local scene grow to staggering heights, as he himself steadily developed from a local hero to the internationally acclaimed artist he is today. From the moment Chaptal first arrived in Holland’s capital, he worked very hard at becoming a professional producer. Mixing bands and dj’s at night as an audio engineer, he used his days to further perfect his own musical style and technique.\r\nChaptal first rose to fame as a member of the Dutch outfit Le Clic. Touring around the country with them, he gained a lot of useful stage experience. These days Chaptal is known as one of Holland’s most agile techno performers – solo as well as together with like minded musicians. This is evident when playing with Kabale und Liebe, Quazar, Boris Werner, David Labeij and Lauhaus under the Amsterdam 661 moniker. Showcasing some of the finest in contemporary techno from the Dutch capital, they’ve had some amazing appearances at places in – and outside of the Netherlands.\r\nWhen Remote Area signed Chaptal as a solo artist, connoisseurs abroad started to get acquainted with his captivating grooves. ’Moldy Beans/Wonderland’ (2006) and its follow up ’Am I Loco Lima’ (2007) set the blueprint for Chaptal’s signature sound, which hovers pleasantly between the rhythmic techno of his Amsterdam contemporaries and the housey roots of his Daft Punkian fatherland. With his first collaboration ’Freedom Fries’ (2007, produced with fellow New Schooler Lauhaus) Chaptal manifested his dexterity as a studio collaborator.\r\nBut Chaptal’s definite breakthrough was established with his critically acclaimed debut album ’Tokens’ (2008), a collection of dancefloor-oriented grooves that took the techno scene by storm. ”Once in a while a techno album comes along that gets the balance just right”, Mixmag put it, praising Tokens as ”a veritable box of delights for the DJ’s”. The techno express rumbles on, as ’Mamdaye’ (2009) shoots to the top twenty of best sold records on Beatport. Or should we say house train.\r\nIn 2010 Julien hit the top of the charts again with his Pump EP which resonated through dance floors around the planet and brought him an new wave of recognition , be it in Colombia, South Africa, or The USA, where he toured extensively in 2011.\r\nHis Latest releases on 2020vision and Intacto Records have received massive DJ support and are now being played, not only by Pete Tong on Radio 1, but surely also on a dance floor near you.\r\nWith more releases planned to hit the international club systems expect to see and hear more from world citizen, Julien Chaptal.",

At that time experimenting with different styles and setups with mild success it wasn't until early 2012 when the artist Karmon was born. Having experienced various flows of electronic music he now set out to develop his own style and with great success.Drumming on all kinds of household equipment and jamming on the guitar until his fingers hurt, it was pretty clear that a path into music was set. When and how was not yet clear at that time.\r\n\r\nIt was in 2003 that Karmon came into contact with electronic music through his older brother. At that time experimenting with different styles and setups with mild success, it wasn’t until early 2012 when the artist now known as Karmon was born. Having experienced various flows of electronic music he now set out to develop his own style and with great success. In a matter of months top chart productions were coming out of the Karmon studio. Starting out with his debut release “Turning Point” on Sintope Digital and then followed up with “Wowshit” on Diynamic.\r\nAll this talent surely could not go by unnoticed, in the summer of 2012, Solomun had already been playing Karmon's tracks and soon after asked him to join their agency (DIY).\r\n\r\nThe studio remained Karmon’s comfort zone where he could experiment and design new sounds, and 2013 represented a ripening of his signature style as a producer, with appearances on Exploited and 2 EPs out on Sintope Digital.Besides the assiduous work in the studio, taking his productions to the dance floor established him as a recognisable DJ with a worldwide fanbase. His sets always represent a composition and are imprinted with his melodic sound, making an impression with track selection and flow.\r\n\r\n2014 was a year of transition for Karmon from a highly specific sound, that most artists develop after a long time, taking it to a minimalistic approach. The progression came gradually, experimenting in his sets and metamorphosing into a mature artist. The focus shifted to a heavy touring schedule, playing on 4 continents, gathering experience from the dance floor and getting closer to the crowd. DJ-ing brought a new perspective and a fresh sound into his productions and materialised into the “Composit” EP on Diynamic, a collaborative partnership with friends and label mates NTFO.\r\n\r\n2015 finds Karmon splitting time between the studio and touring, with a new remix out on Stil vor Talent and new materials awaiting release and appearances on high profile festivals like Extrema Outdoor and Welcome to the Future.",

  "artist_bio": "Almost 20 years ago Liron van Daalen was inspired to become a DJ after his cousin explained to him that the mixtapes he adored were created by one person seamlessly mixing one record into another. That revelation set off a chain of events that has seen him adopt the alias Kabale Und Liebe and rise up to become one of Holland's most exciting and reputable electronic music artists.

That revelation set off a chain of events that has seen him adopt the alias Kabale Und Liebe and rise up to become one of Holland's most exciting and reputable electronic music artists. He is a successful DJ and producer, co-owner of the irrepressible Soweso record label and constantly striving for the highest level of quality throughout everything he does. 2014 marks an important phase in Liron's career as he prepares to unveil his debut album, Realitivity, which delves deeper into his musical persona and sees the Dutchman go back to basics...\r\n\r\nLiron's story began when he was 12 years of age, listening to the anarchic sounds of hardcore and gabba, he was fascinated with the world of electronic music from the get go. He picked up a part-time job and eventually saved enough money to buy some decks. With no one to learn from, he taught himself how to mix and those first naïve steps to learning how to DJ are the cornerstone of his entire career. \r\n\r\nAfter a chance meeting with his idol DJ Rob at a huge rave in Rotterdam (at the age of 14) he cheekily asked if he could jump on the decks. Amazingly, DJ Rob gave him 20 minutes to do his thing in front of 3,000 people. After that there was no going back... Consistent appearances at many of Holland's most respected clubs throughout his teens gave him solid grounding in the art of DJing, and by his early twenties he'd got to work in the studio. By 2007, just a few years after he had started producing, he released Mumbling Yeah, which was named 'Track Of the Year' by Resident Advisor and helped establish him as a great producer. Over the years Kabale und Liebe has maintained the high quality of that early release, with his music signed to labels such as Rush Hour, Souvenir, Rejected and the mighty Strictly Rhythm. \r\n\r\nThe next logical step in Kabale und Liebe's career is the release of his debut album 'Realitivity', which heralds a change in direction for the Dutch master. Switching from software-based music programming to exclusively working on hardware has given him a new lease of life, creating a renewed sense of excitement about music and inspiring him to work on the biggest project of his career so far. Realitivity is based on the notion that everybody's reality is relative to their own personal interpretation. In the context of the album, the music on offer is subjective, built around electronic foundations but avoiding genre specifics. Essentially, the album represents Liron's diverse personal tastes and is an exercise in working beyond the confines of genre labels. The productions are raw and typically groovy, the result of numerous jam sessions in the studio – recorded in one take and run through his analogue mixing desk. Listeners are advised to expect a refreshingly human feel to all of the tracks and a few surprises...\r\n\r\nBeyond the album, Liron continues to tour relentlessly, feeding his desire to keep on sharing the music he loves. A return to spinning vinyl has helped to inject a healthy dose of dynamism back into his sets, some of his old tricks have been brought back into play, reinforcing his love for the craft. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile Soweso remains Liron's pride and joy. Launched in 2009 with fellow Dutchman Lauhaus, the highly-respected label represents the very finest in house and techno music. \r\n\r\nIt's been a long time since the young Liron first encountered electronic music, but the hunger for it remains just as strong now as it was for that 12-year-old boy. Rest assured, music will be Kabale und Liebe's enduring passion for eternity...",

  "artist_bio": "What's made JUNKIE XL one of Europe's premiere Techno outfits is their seamless abililty to create Dance music with a Rock feel. Unlike some Electronic acts who add little scraps of guitar or Rock bands who incorporate simple samples, Amsterdam's JUNKIE XL, with their phat beats, Hip Hop flow and monster riffage, not only blur the lines of live music and samples - they've literally set the standard for all to follow. What's made JUNKIE XL one of Europe's premiere Techno outfits is their seamless abililty to create Dance music with a Rock feel. Unlike some Electronic acts who add little scraps of guitar or Rock bands who incorporate simple samples, Amsterdam's JUNKIE XL, with their phat beats, Hip Hop flow and monster riffage, not only blur the lines of live music and samples - they've literally set the standard for all to follow. \r\n\r\nJUNKIE XL's powerful debut album, 1997's SATURDAY TEENAGE KICK, garnered rave reviews from the likes of SPIN (U.S.) , DETAILS (U.S.) , SPEX (Germany), MUZIK (U.K.): \"S.T.K. isn't an underground album, it's pop, but you won't be able to ignore it because this lot are going to be huge\" and more and successful tours with THE PRODIGY, GRAVITY KILLS and PITCHSHIFTER. The heart and soul of JUNKIE XL is Tom Holkenborg, best known for his remix work with ROADRUNNER bands like FEAR FACTORY (Remanufacture) and SOULFLY. For 1999, JUNKIE XL unleashed it's forceful follow-up, BIG SOUNDS OF THE DRAGS, a deep cerebral fantasia of '70s Guitar Rock, physical breakbeats, classic orchestration, and of course, Tom's dense, complex studio production. This is a record he worked on for over a year - and all the hard work has paid off. \"During the evolution of making tracks, I felt the need to add some warm sounds to the album,\" Tom explains. \"That meant more programming and more live instruments. It adds more depth to the music. I tried to find more variety between the tracks but also within the tracks. I wanted slower songs with a laid back feeling, combined with the fact that some of the aggressive songs on this album are even more aggressive than ones on the first album. It took me a long time to figure out how to do that.\"\r\n\r\nThe title BIG SOUNDS OF THE DRAGS is based upon touring across the Atlantic and taking in that particularly American sport of drag racing. \"I really like drag racing cars because they sound big, yet they're so... funny,\" Holkenborg offers. \"They look funny, and they only drive a couple of hundred yards. They're so vulnerable, at a certain high speed always ready to crash and burn. On this album, one side has this big sound, and on the other, there's some beautiful moments. I found this record in America of the sound of Drag racing cars from the '60s, and I felt a connection with this record.\" The drag racing theme is brought home on this package by longtime JUNKIE XL collaborators Rod Chong & Sharon Matarazzo  (MEDIAKILL) and their futuristic/organic cover art. But while visuals are nice, it's the music that matters most, right? Highlights of 'THE DRAGS' include the straight-up breakbeat science of \"Action Radius\", the ambient drug drone of \"Zerotonine\" and \"Next Plateau\" with its mellow Hip Hop grooves with reversed/reverbed guitar and vocals. Perhaps the best cut, the one that most embodies the JUNKIE XL attitude, is \"Power of Big Slacks\", a huge-sounding Punk anthem with heavy Dance rhythms and mad crazy Pop hooks. \"I've been listening to a lot of Pop albums lately, especially from the '60s - stuff from The Byrds and the Beatles and Pink Floyd - and you'll hear so many sounds on those records that you just don't hear anymore in the '90s. I'm a big fan of albums by Pavement and a Scottish band called Mogwai, and what I really like is that there's so much warmth in there. And that's what I've tried to do, in my own way.\" Face it, JUNKIE XL is takin' it to anotha level. Will you? ",

His music has spread over the techno scene quickly in the last 2 years. With his track “Prospect”, he really caught the ears of the bigger artists and things moved quickly ever since.\r\n\r\nBorn and raised in the north of the Netherlands, Keith grew up consuming music - his parents filled the house with tracks from New Order, the Dire Straits, and Donna Summer - and as a teenager, he spent hours exploring new artists in record stores.\r\nIn 2008, Keith burst onto the scene playing and producing house and electro music. \r\n\r\nLater, inspired by Surgeon, Juan Atkins, Ben Klock, Chris Liebling, Adam Beyer and Ben Sims, he discovered his true passion and style: techno. His techno tracks have since been played by DVS1, Maceo Plex, Adam Beyer, Rødhåd, Marcel Fengler, Chris Liebing, Joel Mull, Invite, Klaudia Gawlas, and many others.\r\n\r\nBased in Amsterdam, Keith plays and makes underground techno with a catchy twist. No flat-line techno, but no big room techno either. The deep beats combined with effective melodies and groovy rhythms, assures that his tracks are in many tracklists. You might know him from his track “Prospect”, “Untold” or “Analysis”. All released on his home label “Affin”. More releases to come in the upcoming months, so stay tuned!",

  "artist_bio": "Kapibara consists of three members, two playing the decks. They produce and play Deep House / Techno and includes influences of wildlife.In the summer of 2012 a lost technician sends out an S.O.S. signal in the middle of the Amazone near the Rio Araguaia. Two rangers went to the rescue and saved the helpless man from this beautiful but hazardous environment. From that moment, Kapibara (Hystricomorpha) was born. After making sounds for a while , mostly without recording anything, they decided that it was time to take the next step and produce some tracks. In March 2013 their first projects were shown the light of day. Their sounds floats somewhere between deephouse and techno strongly influenced by wildlife and blended into their organic electronical tones. Feeling and emotion converged into a pallet of natural grooves, guided by drums that are deeply rooted in the Amazon wilderness.\r\nOver the course of the past two years the trio has spent a lot of time perfecting their amazon infused jungle sounds in the studio which hans't gone unnoticed: after being aligned with Claydrum for a couple of years they decided it was time to spread their wings and became residents at the already infamous Labyrinth club in Antwerp earlier this year. Since then they've played in clubs like café d' Anvers, Forty Five, Labyrinth & Panama, Festivals like Solar, XO Outdoor & Laundry Day and shared stages with icons like Tale of Us, Solomun and Joris Voorn. Always leaving the crowd in a state of infinite high or deeper consciousness.\r\nIn 2015 they already dropped several gems like their Tuatara EP on Dear Deer Records and the earlier Arapaima EP on Labyrinth music. With lots of promissing things in the pipeline Kapibara is definitely one of those names you want to keep your eyes on.",

  "artist_bio": "Kamara are a Dutch Techno live-act that have been making waves way beyond their hometown of Arnhem in 2015. From their first forays into making music under various guises, Kamara were formed in 2010 and have been steadily building their way up through the echelons of the electronic underground.This past year the guys have unleashed material on A-list labels such Tronic Music, Sudbeat, Bush, Natura Viva and Proton, picking up remixes along the way from legendary artists such as Carl Cox, Oliver Lieb, Tom Hades, Daniel Nitsch / The Glitz.\r\n\r\nOf course records on these kinds of labels don’t go unnoticed. Their material has been played and championed by a wide range of their peer artists such as Nicole Moudaber, Christian Smith, Sian, Sasha, Technasia and Laurent Garnier, proving that labels and DJ’s alike are buying into the Kamara sound.\r\n\r\nTheir sound palette is wide ranging within the techno sphere. From heavy repetitive techno with ethnic undertones, to a more melodic yet driving tech house sound, their musical path comes from the inspiration they get from the many different musical cultures they incorporate into their tracks. These worldly influences are distinctively heard in their sets, which are underpinned by the universal sound of electronic music.\r\n\r\nAnd because life isn’t all about making and playing music Kamara also invest a lot of time into their successful party Metamorphosa. This party create a space where the musical identity of Kamara gets a wider exposure and it offers a great opportunity to collaborate and perform with other artists.\r\n\r\nPerformances have been made at other leading events around the globe too, with festival and club appearances at Fusion Festival (DE) , Midi Festival (CN), Kommt Zusammen (DE), Ying Yang (Great Wall, China) Free Your Mind Festival (NL), Lantern (CH), Panama (NL) and The Mansion (CH).\r\n\r\nKamara have put themselves on a fast track to success with the right balance of hard work and talent. With more material getting interest from established labels, and the foundations they have already put down at Tronic, Bush and Sudbeat, you know Kamara are an act you will be hearing a lot more from.",

Keeping the 1's and 2's rolling with funky bass driven house and sexy techno with a nu-disco after taste is a simple interpretation of their output.\r\n\r\nKERK!KERK! is Robert Mulder and Juri Mirales, a pair of highly energized and loveably enthusiastic DJs and producers who have quickly risen to the top of the pile. Having first met in snowy French alps in 2008, the duo started working together in earnest in 2010 and since then have been tight friends and close collaborators with a great reputation in the Dutch capital. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to work in the studio, Kerk! - meaning Church! (amen) - infuse their producitons with influences from notorious countrymen like Boris Wener, Lauhaus, Tom Trago and Kabale Und Liebe as well as with hip hop, funk, soul and more classical house tropes.  The resulting remixes have come on labels like Movements, OFF Recordings and a sub-label of Gem, with clean grooves, odd basslines and spaced out synth sounds charactering every one.\r\n\r\n“We're straight forward guys, rooted in the Amsterdam scene but always down for a chill and some nice tunes” say the pair who have residencies at WKND (Studio 80) and Backstage (Chicago Social Club) whilst playing further afield at places like Berlin’s Katerholzig and Salon zur Wilde Renate, Amsterdam’s Melkweg, AIR and many others including ID&T's Valhalla Festival and Edit Festival.\r\n\r\nBoth in their mid-twenties, KERK! have many more musical projects up their sleeves for this year, including a debut solo EP and more work with Dutch DJ collective Barre Tijden. This, then, is just the beginning for this unique new school pairing.",

He offered them two spots on the Gem Samplers on his imprint Gem Records to introduce themselves to the outside world. Their next releases on GEM and Chameleon Records are due in the beginning of 2013.\r\n\r\n“…We waited to come out with \"our\" sound. A track needs to tell it's own story and that may take some time. Besides that, we also need to understand what we're doing musically.”\r\n\r\n Performance-wise; KDGH will not always give you the casual DJ performance. They also try to expand the visual and sonic experience by jamming along with tracks with drum-computers and external effects. \r\n\r\n\"…You can really interact with the audience. A little snare roll here and a white noise groove there. Whatever supports the track that's played and brings the dance floor to life…\"\r\n\r\nContact & Bookings: \r\ninfo@kaapdegoedehoop.net",

  "name": "Kajan Chow",
  "profile_photo": "http://www.residentadvisor.net/images/profiles/kajanchow.jpg",
  "cover_photo": "",
  "artist_bio": "Kajan Chow is a musical chameleon for more than a decade. His versatility in handling and designing dj-sessions brought him to respectable places as Ministry of Sound, Pacha, Cafe d’Anvers, along with appearances in Poland, Bulgaria, Tel-Aviv, Miami, and China. He prefers to include changeableness in his sets; Contagious house grooves and techno are inextricable elements for him. However, don’t be surprised if you hear him play chill-out and jazz-rhythms in one of his down/mid-tempo dj-sessions. As Kajan established himself as a friendly- and open-minded spirit towards music, he is moving forward within the contemporary electronic- and sonic- landscape.Kajan Chow’s interest in deejaying emerged around 1999. When he turned 15, his Parisian uncle saw Kajan’s curiosity for vinyl-records, and so uncle promised to bring an ‘old turntable’ so that Kajan could practice. This turned out to be the Technics SL 1200 Mk2 model, initiating Kajan’s drive for collecting records. As DJ Saturn (his artist name until 2010) he played local bars and disco’s around his hometown Breskens, a fisherman’s town along the coast of the Zeeland Province (Netherlands). In the early days, Kajan played Hiphop, House, Disco, 80ties and 90ties music. Holiday‐trips to China created Kajan’s understanding that his family holds artistic talent, as one uncle played the Erhu (Chinese violin), and another uncle appeared in several Chinese theater shows.\r\n\r\n2000 ‐ 2003: After graduating from high school, he relocated to Rotterdam to study Business Administration. He was invited to tour and play across the Netherlands, at the still emerging Asian Parties. These tours crossed all major cities in the Netherlands, Belgium, and UK. Highlights from this period was playing at Ministry of Sound in (August 2003, London), Nighttown, Now & Wow (Rotterdam), Danssalon (Eindhoven), to name a few. His weekly stroll to the record stores in Rotterdam influenced Kajan with decent house music, as he also frequently drove to Belgium and visited clubs where US-­house icons (such as Derrick Carter, Mark Farina, Gene Farris, JT Donaldson, Sneak etc.) had their followers.\r\n\r\n2004 -­ 2006: Kajan got awarded ‘BEST DJ’ (2005, Hooikoorts), and ‘RUNNER‐UP’ at the (2004) Mezz Johan Diepstraten Dance Award. Members of the judging panel agreed that Kajan’s set was a ‘feast for the ears’, as his eclectic style was compared to 2Many DJ’s. Kajan always kept his versatility as his sets nowadays range from contagious house grooves, jazz rhythms, complex deep‐house and intelligent techno, to disco, funk, and electronica. Kajan plays again in London, at Ministry of Sound (2004) and Pacha (2005). In 2005, he relocated to Amsterdam and got awarded as ‘BEST DJ’ at the Amsterdam Student Festival (2006). As much he enjoyed the work and passion behind the decks, he co­‐founded (w/ Deene) his own night called ‘NU EVEN DEEPHOUSE (NED)’ in 2005. Furthermore, he was curator for ‘Natural High’, bringing respected headliners such as Phil Weeks, Gene Farris, Jamanta Crew, Homero Espinosa, Swirl People, Massimo daCosta, and many more. Natural High were the first annual beach‐parties in the Zeeland Coast‐area.\r\n￼\r\n￼￼2007 ­‐ 2010: He joined SoulSessions Agency (between 2006 -­ 2009) and found his place among a respectful deep house/ soulful house roster, alongside many international dj / artists. During this period he played monthly residencies across the Netherlands and Belgium, often working together with musicians. In 2009, Kajan’s sound started to lean towards the darker edges of the electronic spectrum, so the use of ‘Kajan Chow’ as artist name became evident. In late 2009, Kajan relocated NED to Beachhouse 25, a magical place at the beach in his hometown Breskens. It turned out to be a solid foundation for Kajan’s creative entrepreneurship, bringing international and national dj’s to the beaches of Breskens, such as Charles Webster, Remy, VCO Rox, Ladybird from Paris, Chappell, Matthew Styles and so on. During this period he also deejayed at the Miami Winter Music Conference (2007 to 2010), and started to perform at Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE). In 2010 he releases his first original track ‘End Of Season’ on Bounce House Records (US), after his first remix as DJ Saturn on Oded Nir’s ‘Jack Attack’ (Suntree Records) received airplay on KISS FM (Australia). Several months later, Kajan’s rework on Oded Nir ft. King Dread James joined the ’Midnight Snacker EP’ alongside remixes by JT Donaldson, The Timewriter and Lewis Ferrier on Suntree Records. In 2010, Kajan saw the five-­year mark of NED becoming a fact, and therefore he set-­up a series of celebration parties, while late 2010 also brought him to tour in Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n2011 ‐ 2013: In early 2011 Kajan played his first time gig in Shanghai, at Shiva Lounge. Beachhouse 25 moved to a new location in 2010, when Nu Even Deephouse celebrated its 5 year anniversary. The new location allowed NED to involve wider forms of arts, setting­‐up events that capture the feeling of summer to the fullest. Consequently the creation of ‘La Saison’, a new annual night, emerged in Spring 2011. Kajan also picked up doing his long deejay sets, playing for example at restaurants as Michelin­‐star awarded Pure C Resto-­Bar. In 2012, Kajan Chow’s remix on Tom K’s ‘Lack of Oxygen’ became the pick of the release and received support from Charles Webster, Spiritchaser, Dave Mayer and many more. Another tour in China crossed cities such as Huizhou, Dongguan and Shenzhen in early 2012, and playing for the first time in Tel-Aviv (August). In 2013, he is a regular guest-dj for Groove to Chill for 10 years now, playing at their infamous factory-parties. His understanding in concepts gave him the chance to compile and mix ‘T Zwin Autumn Grooves’ – CD compilation (Suntree Records). Lastly, Kajan continues to be a representative for electronic music culture by establishing CONNECT (2013), which has a deeper focus on techno music.\r\n\r\n2014 – present:\r\nwww.kajanchow.com",

Their repertoire spans from house to techno and be it Supperclub or all-night raves, KassAssie is like a fish in the water.

  "artist_bio": "Kadir Pelit, a guy who grew up in Holland with Turkish roots. A highly driven DJ who aimes to cutting people loose from the masses with his music. Mixing minimal house that flows naturally to techhouse and soulfoul techno is the best way to describe his sound. Kadir Pelit played already on several parties, each time telling people beautiful electronic stories.\r\nKadir Pelit is also the founder of Undertone, Undertone is a new concept launched in 2010. Look out for Undertone for coming events! \r\n..Kadir Pelit is a guy who grew up in Holland with Turkish roots. He first met his love for music at a very young age. As a nine-year old kid, vacationing in Turkey, he figured out you could have compilation tapes made at a certain store. From that moment on, it was impossible to get him away from there. When he arrived back in Rotterdam, he had collected a treasure trove full of new music. Repeating the same cycle every year.\r\nFrom Tina Turner to Michael Jackson 80’s music. And always keeping a special place in his heart for his Turkish roots and its music. Something he never wants to forget.\r\n \r\nIn later life, he found more inspiration from artists like Michel de Hey, Derrick May, Ronald Molendijk, Benny Rodrigues (a good friend of his), Remy, Dave Clarke, Steve Bug, Aphex Twin and many more. Long before getting his own turntables, these names inspired him to start collecting records. And soon his collection grew considerable in size.\r\nNot long hereafter he found what he was looking for (or it found him?). Two Technics turntables a friend of him spotted at a pawnshop. Feeling so strongly about the need for Kadir to have his own decks. This friend didn’t hesitate to buy them, and even carried them straight to Kadir’s house (who was at work at the time). \r\nMany music lovers, including Kadir, owe this man much gratitude. Making sure this talent didn’t stay unchallenged.\r\n \r\nSince then, Kadir has evolved into a highly driven DJ, who aims to cut people loose with his music. ‘A mix of minimal house that flows naturally into tech-house and soulful techno’, is the best way to describe his sound. \r\nKadir Pelit has played at most top locations in Rotterdam and far beyond, each time telling the people a beautiful electronic story. Earning his first experience at infamous clubnights like/in Sound Architecture, Nighttown and Off Corso. After that expanding to Herr Zimmerman and Gasten Zonder Grenzen, which was when things really started to roll. Eventually leading to gigs at Solar Festival, a residency at club Catwalk (300MPH/DIK) and frequent appearances at Tuneskin events.\r\n \r\nThis all naturally evolved into him starting up his own concept, Undertone, which launched in 2010. Starting with a dream, putting it into practice with endless passion and drive. Presenting his crowd with the best line-ups Kadir can think of. No concessions and doing what he loves most: Creating beautiful musical nights!\r\n \r\nExpect much more from Kadir and Undertone.",

  "artist_bio": "The Dude Rezzie hinted at something amazing in the \"New Encounters\" section of his last post on Weird Magic. Jssst is a minimal techno freaker from Amsterdam. HisSoundcloud is full of (mostly) downloadable material. Jssst dives into the dark and brooding side of trance-inducing dance music, drugging the listener/dancer with deep mechanical bludgeonings on repeat. Hard to place exactly what my favorite jams are here, sort of like it's hard to choose a favorite Raga from Charanjit Singh's Ten Ragas To a Disco Beat - Jssst's cuts are all so euphoric and uplifting it's hard to care about one stopping when there's another right behind it.              Jeff Goldblum Life.Jssst (Pronounce: Just) is a music addict based in Amsterdam. \r\nInvolved with music from a very young age, he started listening to Electronic Music at the age of fourteen. House Music was coming up and a great outlet for the young generation. After some while, he bought turn tables and learned to mix.\r\n\r\nAround the year 2000, he moved to Amsterdam to study Econometrics. It's a mix of Economics and Mathematics. Two different disciplines are combined to create something new. It's a brilliant way to produce new stuff as it works for music as well. Always looking for new ways to make tracks or to mix tracks for a DJ set. This approach reflects Jssst.\r\n\r\nWhile he was studying, he wanted  to know more about music; he started to learn to play the guitar. \r\nThe positive experience from playing an instrument made him curious to learn to play the piano as well.\r\nHe started writing his own tracks on the acoustic instruments. In the end the Personal Computer won when he started producing Electronic Music. Driven by an inner motivation to create each day something new. He's a productive guy. His style is uncatchable, but catchy! Genre isn't a word in his vocabulary. It's about flavor, passion and quality. \r\n\r\nAfter finishing his study, he decided to chose for his passion. He decided to dedicate his life to music, no matter what. \r\n\r\nHe owns three digital record labels. And yeah, he's playing as well. He's doing some gigs, mainly in Amsterdam.  But with his internet activity he's connecting with the world.",

It was around that time he finds another hidden talent within himself, song writing.\r\n\r\nAt the age of fifteen, a friend gave him a simple music production program fruityloops, they started to make some sounds just for fun. Kasper soon realised this was something he wanted to pursue more seriously, Cubase offered a more serious approach and Kasper was to go from there.\r\n\r\nKasper met someone else who shared the same interests, together they worked in the studio for many hours, producing Minimal & Techno. Kasper instantly noticed the thirst for production was to strong to ignore, so he spent a lot of his time doing nothing more than producing, and spinning in the months ahead.\r\n\r\n2007 he bought his very first CD-players. He combine playing/producing techno and playing the drums until he achieved his goal in 2008 when his first remix and his own track ‘Audio 11' was released on Sunset to Sunrise Recordings. You can find some of his work under an alias called ‘Dudda’.\r\n\r\n2008 he started to DJ at some local bars. He changed his music taste mainly from trance to techno and now only produces under Kasper V.\r\n\r\n2009 he started his own label called MuziKnights then Beat Sessions was born on CityBeat Radio.",

Jurwin Abbo lives for his music.\r\n\r\nFor a long time only friends and people close new that here was somebody with a unique talent. This wasn’t without reason. “I think it’s most important that you take your time and get things right. I have to be able to stand behind my music for the full 100% , Jurwin explains.” Like always this quest for sheer perfection did not come easy. Things started ten years ago when at the age of 17 Jurwin took on the challenge and difficult task of crafting quality electronic music.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe learned everything there was to know about software. His Amersfoort apartment fills with laughter when Jurwin thinks back of those days. “For a long timed I tried every piece of music software I could get my hands on and experimented with different styles. It was important for me that I could produce every aspect of the tracks myself.” The last couple off years things gradually started to fall into place and all the effort has resulted in a producer and live performer with a truly unique sound.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis sound is best described as a combination of beat driven takes around warm melodies, blissed atmospherics & analogue (sub) bass - always jacking, mostly tripping and always around the foundations of his first love: techno. It’s a powerfull yet delicate sound that is sure to get people moving but never dull and static like many of the loop based ableton productions that are being released at the moment.",

It all started when Kid Culture got his first set of turntables at the age of 12 and started spinning funk and jazz records from his parents vast vinyl collection. It didn’t take long before the Kid got infected – as a lot of Amsterdam DJ’s at the time – with the hip hop virus.  The big turning point came in 1988 – the second summer of love – when Amsterdam got its first taste of Chicago house and Detroit techno. Kid Culture instantly got hooked and his musical heroes up to today were the same culprits responsible for introducing these new sounds to Amsterdam way back then: Roxy’s (RIP) resident DJ Dimitri, Detroit legend Derrick May and the French master Laurent Garnier.\r\nBy the mid nineties Kid Culture already had residencies at iconic clubs such as Paradiso and Mazzo (RIP). It didn’t take long before he got booked for one the first editions of Awakenings at Amsterdam’s Gasworks, the Borealis festival (FR) and oddly enough several times at the renowned jazz festival of Montreux (CH), which really underlines Kid Cultures broad musical scope.  By the turn of the century Kid Culture was producing his own material. Already being a highly skilled DJ the following decade he would dedicate lots of his time and energy to master the craft and become the prolific producer he is today.\r\n\r\n2011 was the year when things really took of for Kid Culture. In Holland you’re considered one of the big Don’s once you get booked for Awakenings Festival, Soenda Indoor, Solar, Static at the Beach and Extrema Festival and your records get spinned by jocks of the likes of Steve Lawler, Laurent Garnier, Carl Craig and Pete Tong. His big break abroad was the direct result of the full support his first release on Suara ‘It’s green on the other side’ (2010) and ‘So addictive’ on Remote Area (2011) got from Ricardo Villalobos and Luciano. The heavy rotation of these two tracks landed Kid Culture on the bill of Spanish label Suara’s showcase at Barcelona’s Sonar Festival. To top things of Kid Culture got booked at Berlin’s Tresor. Another Kid’s dream that came true.\r\n\r\nBy 2012 Kid Culture was an established DJ and producer and together with his stage and studio partner René Engel he has been rocking dance floors nationwide weekend after weekend. His longtime friendship with Engel amounted into the highly acclaimed ’Visions’ EP on the Sincopat label in 2012. Resident Advisor gave a raving revue and rated Kid Culture into the same league where musical connoisseurs such as John Talbot and Kalabrese reside.\r\nKid Culture got lots of airplay and support on Dance Department – Hollands no.1 EDM radio show – for his Bob Marley remix of ‘Exodus’. Kid Cultures ever ongoing ride of musical awesomeness accumulated into opening for Paul Kalkbrenner at Extrema Outdoor 2012 and 2020 Vision Ralph Lawson firmly claiming the ‘Exodus’ remix to be the pinnacle of his sets at Ibiza’s hallmark club Pacha.\r\n\r\nAnd Kid Culture’s future looks even brighter with the release of his debut solo album set for the summer of 2013 and the collaboration with the We Are E agency. So, look out for Mr. Culture and always remember: today’s kids are tomorrow’s citizens.",

Peak moment for 2011 clearly was hitting the number one spot in the deep/tech house chart on trackitdown together with Flavourables. “What I See” from the Ensemble EP on Manchester Underground Music received great responses and reviews and was a definite crowd pleaser. \r\nWith a future sight on some great releases and having found love and a home at Kreativ Productions, L’Atelier is on top of their game. L’Atelier’s DJ sets at multiple, different venues throughout the country made them one of the new homecoming talents from Amsterdam. What sets L'Atelier apart is their sense of flow.

In that period it was all Hip Hop for him but soon he also found that House music had a great attraction to him, especially the early days of House from Detroit and Chicago. After four years of exploring all different aspects of House music, his interest in the older music styles such as Funk and Soul started growing...\r\n\r\nVery quickly James Brown, Al Green, Patrice Rushen and Funkadelic became regulars in his choice of music. When he turned his hobby into work in 1999, he was already mixing different styles of music together. Since his first residency in nightclub Panama he became a regular DJ at events in big and small clubs in Amsterdam (Paradiso, Jimmy Woo, De Kring, Studio K), The Hague ('t Paard), Rotterdam (Off Corso) and Utrecht (Tivoli).\r\n\r\nThe last four years his DJ'ing has evolved to playing the whole range of electronic music. Lars doesn’t submit to genre but dedicates himself to good music in general. His energetic sets are well known for their progressive and up to date nature. Combined with a forward vision, he is rapidly becoming an international respected DJ and producer. This year will be the year of several releases and the birth of new projects with different artists.\r\n\r\nNext to DJ'ing and producing, Lars Vegas hosts several clubnights such as Longplay (House), BLOCKPARTY (Indie-Dance) and METRO (Deephouse & Nu-Disco). In 2007 he also founded FewKidsOnTheBlock; a creative collective that stands for a strong network of Amsterdams brightest creative minds. Events, nightmarketing, DJ programming, remix projects, producers and graphical designers, all rolled into one.\r\n\r\nLars’ selfmade future is looking brighter by the year and it won't be long before he, his tracks and his clubnights will be an established part of the international nightlife...",

Although he turned out to be pretty talented, he never really mastered any instrument, untill...\r\n\r\nIn 2006, he met the guys from \"CLiKK\". A small minimal/house-organisation born purely out of their enthousiasm for the music. These guys infected Lager with the virus and would prove to be a big help and inspiration. Other inspirations come in the form of djs such as Sandeep, Pushkarev and Gorje Hewek.\r\n\r\nAfter a period of expirimenting with different mixing techniques and subgenres, Lager seems to have found his sound in warm, deep, and smooth tech-house with a distinctive deep drive. \"When I'm browsing for records, I'm looking for that sound that makes me want to get off my chair and jump behind my decks. I need to feel a warmth from the very first beat I hear.\"\r\n\r\nIn 2010 he entered the \"Catwalk DJ-contest\" in club Catwalk in Rotterdam after being selected out of over 150 demos and made it to the semi-finals. Not making it all the way, but with enough positive feedback to motivate him to keep on spreading his warm sounds. \r\n\r\nThese warm sounds can be heard more and more in Rotterdams' scene since he is now a member of the well known organisation \"Undertone\". Playing along side dj's like; Sandeep, Kadir Pelit, Gabriel Ananda at clubs such as; Catwalk, Perron, Toffler and Pand48.\r\n\r\n2012 has been a great year for Lager, and 2013 is already beating it with the biggest edition of Undertone so far (playing along side Sebo K, and Rodriguez Junior) and his first international gig on the 22nd of Februari (Kiev, Ukraine).",

  "artist_bio": "Born and raised in Amsterdam, Lauhaus has been active in the Dutch and international dance scene for over a decade. With his sound ranging from house to techno, Lauhaus has always shown his diversity in his sets as well as in his productions. Apart from his activities as a dj/producer, Lauhaus is running two labels together with his longtime friend Kabale und Liebe: Soweso Records and We Dig. Music.After many legendary nights in Studio 80, Lauhaus was invited to become a resident DJ at the infamous Amsterdam based club. Since 2011 Lauhaus and Kabale und Liebe have been hosting their Soweso label nights at this venue with great success.\r\n\r\nAs a producer, Lauhaus has been active on many fronts in the past years. Besides his releases on his own labels Soweso and We Dig. Music, he released on many established international labels. After many well received releases on Amsterdam labels Remote Area and Intacto, Lauhaus's breakthrough release was the track \"Back to Ipanema\" on Frankfurt's legendary Cocoon Recordings. This gave him worldwide exposure and established his name in the international scene. His most recent output called \"Hiphouse\", a collaboration with Kabale und Liebe on Joris Voorn's label Rejected, reached the 19th place on Resident Advisor’s ‘Most charted tracks of 2012’.\r\n\r\nNext to these successes, Lauhaus has been active on labels like Get Physical, Sushitech, ViVa Music, Circus Company, Bangbang! and Fasten Musique, just to name a few. Before establishing himself as a solo artist, Lauhaus formed the Polder project together with David Labeij in 2006. As Polder they released their album \"Poldermodel\" on Shinedoe’s Intacto label in 2008. \r\n\r\nBesides playing all the major venues and festivals in his native country the Netherlands, Lauhaus has been touring the globe playing in clubs like Watergate (Berlin), Electric Pickle (Miami), Sankeys (Ibiza & Manchester), Arma 17 (Moscow), Space (Ibiza), D-Edge (Sao Paolo), Rex (Paris) and Eleven (Tokyo).\r\n\r\nDISCOGRAPHY:\r\n\r\nRELEASES:\r\n\r\nLAUHAUS\r\nBangbang! | Lauhaus - Baobab\r\nWe Dig.

  "artist_bio": "Since the Dutch producers trio Kraak & Smaak released their first album 'Boogie Angst' in the UK, the Netherlands, the USA and Japan in 2005, the boys' live band has grown into a steady and well-respected force in today's international club and festival scene.Initially the live band is put together solely as a one-off promotional tool for their first album. But with that premiering show in Amsterdam, with its energetic mix of funk, disco and house, plus a heavy dosis of rock 'n roll attitude, it impressed people so much that they quickly decide to embark on a follow up by organizing a first club tour in the Netherlands.\r\n\tTheir set-up, combining the fat club sound of their releases with live musicians and male and female vocalists, turns out to be a totally unheard of musical phenomenon in the Dutch club and festival circuit at the time, leading to invitations to play at Holland's biggest festival, Pinkpop, and support slots for UK superstar dance act Faithless in enormodomes in the Netherlands and Belgium. \r\n\tWith the first international successes release-wise, fed by album licences, television and movie syncs in the USA and growing club- and radio support in more and more countries, the band land their first big European festival, Sziget in Hungary. A short breath later K&S find themselves in Australia for a full tour and introduce themselves to the American audience through playing shows on renowned festivals as SXSW, Coachella, Miami's WMC and New York's CMJ. \r\n\tThe second album 'Plastic People' drops in 2008, and off that album, the hit single 'Squeeze Me', makes for an even more rapid rise of Kraak & Smaak internationally: the acclaimed UK dance magazine IDJ labels K&S as a “Must see live act”, together with big guns as the Chemical Brothers, Moby and The Prodigy. The band subsequently performs at the 'holy grail of festivals' Glastonbury in the UK, Lowlands in the Netherlands and again Europe's biggest festival, Sziget. During a five-week live tour across the USA they perform at Jimmy Kimmel's late night show on ABC television and further explicit support comes from US Celebrity blogger Perez Hilton, who describes K&S as ‘Amy Winehouse meets Moby’). Even Kanye West declares himself a fan. And to top things off, the European Border Breakers Award (EBBA) is won, together with none other than Adele. \r\n\r\n\tThe next years, the upward trend of K&S is continued and solidified with the albums 'Electric Hustle' (2011) and 'Chrome Waves' (2013). Again live tours are mapped and carried out in the USA, as are a second visit to UK's Glastonbury festival and shows at Detroit Movement, Sziget and Exit. First steps are taken too in Latin-America and Asia.  \r\n\tAt this point in time, the Kraak & Smaak has grown into a renowned international crossover live act that will tear apart many a club or festival, whether a dance, jazz , rock or pop one. So no faceless laptop act that seems so abundant nowadays in the dance scene, but an accessible yet uncompromising, full-fledged live band with drums, bass guitar, keys, dj and a male and female vocalist, matched up with their distinctive clubsound and their rock band stage attitude.",

Jan Dulles, and ‘On Top Of The World’ - Ft. Anders Wigelius.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the momentum has been building for the Kid for some time - from his globe-straddling track ‘Pants down spanking’, and ‘Contagious’, remixing for artists like Sean Paul & Kelly Rowland in 2012, to the anthemic remix of ‘Punk’ of Ferry Corsten back in 2003.\r\nAs for his new musical arsenal - it’s receiving massive feedback from big boys like Tiësto, Calvin Harris, Afrojack, Quintino and R3hab - smashing clubs into tiny pieces wherever they are dropped.\r\n \r\nNext to Kid’s big love for modern club tracks, a whole different side has been showing in the last couple of months. Euphoric sounding dance/pop tracks containing catchy vocals ready to conquer the charts worldwide are a fact. Collaborations with vocalists like Dutch superstar Jan Dulles are taking the Kid Vicious sound to a next level.  \r\n\r\nPlaying all over the planet makes Kid Vicious one of the established DJs of this moment. Countries like UK, Scotland, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Switzerland, Tunisia, Germany, Poland, Israel, Canada, Spain, USA and many more are already known with his enigmatic DJ set’s.\r\n\r\nEven though that Kid Vicious has been absent for a short while whilst concentrating on other projects his name has never faded from the club land memory. The Kid’s hunger for success is stronger than ever and with an armoury of upcoming tunes up his sleeve, the monthly Global Mode Podcast, and a worldwide touring schedule the Kid is more than ready to conquer the world once again!\r\n\r\nMore info www.djkidvicious.com   www.soundcloud.com/kidvicious    www.facebook.com/iamkidvicious\r\n",

If you’ve ever heard LarryKoek play, you would know that they combine Deep House with guitar riffs, piano chords and funky baselines, to create a sound that makes people happy and dance for hours.\r\n\r\nWith several big gigs under their belt, such as ‘’Liebe Zur Musik’’ (CH), ''Lunacy'' (ES), ‘’Club Dieper’’ (NL), ‘’Collegebal’’ (BE) and Secret Festival (NL) LarryKoek is making headway in the Melodic House scene. Their remix of Hungry’s “Dotan” brought a lot of attention on to them from their producer counterparts, to fans a like, receiving support from Gamper & Dadoni, Sam Feldt, Kav Verhouzer, De Hofnar, and more!\r\n\r\nWith lots of new releases on the way, 2015 is set to be a great year for Mark and Lars!",

When way too old he started making techno despite his great aversion to electronic music.He started producing under great pressure of his environment, who stated that making music is the best way for a stable base salary and has the best career opportunities. He therefore had to wave his longlife passion (to work as an office clerk) goodbye.\r\n\r\nHis shortage of talent is something Koen is very proud of and is beyond compare. Very few other artist were able to create such uninspired crappy techno music.\r\n\r\nKoen's songs are currently not played by great artists like James Holden, Nuno dos Santos and Gabriel Ananda. Nor are they played by any other DJ.",

  "artist_bio": "Newton da Costa, the first Brazilian to climb the Dutch mountains, and Pieter ‘don’t like cheese’ Ridder met in the pouring rain of Holland in the year 2005, that became known as the year of Simon Gfeller from Muensingen, Switzerland, who was crowned the world’s best dive bombing champion. Being lost like a dog in the centre of The Hague, they decided to work together in the discovery of new neighbor-annoying experiments, codename Le chien Perdu. Their uplifting melodramatic sound leads to a subtle balance between tears and joy, without becoming sadistic or maniacal. During their tour they played in clubs like the RexClub in Paris and Paradiso in Amsterdam, and brought them even to great cities like Uithoorn and Middel-Harnis. What? Indeed…\t\r\n\r\n\r\nSince electronic music's earliest endeavours, The Hague has steadily provided us with superior artists in different genres. The city's latest dance music generation is represented by the likes of Newton da Costa and Pieter Ridder. Brought together by their shared love of house, hip hop, jazz, soul and funk, they formed Le Chien Perdu in 2005. Even though they like to describe their own music as \"House music with a twist\", the goal remains to make uneasily categorized dancefloor driven songs.\r\nSince their live act took off early 2006, Le Chien Perdu have been lined-up with some of their greatest heroes: Ark, Cabanne, Audio Werner, Agnes and Antislash. Their smashing debut on Cupari records, The Greed EP (2007), added a great deal to their fame in The Netherlands and abroad. With The Cause Of Tangerines EP (including an Ark remix) coming out on Paris' renowned Karat label and The Backyard Boogie EP on Amsterdam's fresh Made With Love, the world is set to hear a lot more of their quirky sounds.",

So he only plays his favorite house music like Joris Voorn, Sander Kleinenberg, Ramon Tapia, Hermanez, Nikitin & Semikashev and Daft Punk is also a great DJ couple in Lars’ eyes.Biography:\r\nSince Lars got his first computer he’d loved to play music trough his PC-speakers. He always listened to his favorite songs and not tho the popular ones. At a age of 14 his brother got a cheap mixingpanel with 2 turntables. But it didn’t look cool to him and he’d never touched that things untill, his brother won a DJ-contest and he saw his brother enjoying to play his favorite music and the crowd also enjoyed it. As 14 year old boy Lars started to interest in those DJ-equipment of his brother and played some music from artist like Groove Armada, DJ Sneak, Funkerman, Grooveyard, Gregor Salto, Audio Bullys etc. Also in 2007 known house music (that was unknown to him).\r\nThats were all started.\r\nAfter 1 year of “playing” with the equipment of his brother, he get some beginner tips. Practice day after day and at his 16 birthday he’d played in 2008 for the first time in front of crowd. His own friends, after that he just got some compliments of his brother, and then he really figured out that DJ’ing was really cool! And he say to his brother “I wan’t to play for a bigger crowd” And a year later (2009) he played at ErnestHouse but he screwed thanks to his nerves. His brother catch the fallin’ self-confidence of the young artist and played together the rest of the gig.\r\nA year of nothing he played at some exam/birthday parties at friends.\r\nNow the 18 year old DJ wan’t to get at least a little bit of local known. He is also a organization member of Inner Beats Events and a resident DJ at these evenings.\r\nA start of sharing his favorite music with the crowd has been started.",

Meanwhile the guys have been booked together at parties such as; Hertz, Electronation, minimal feestmaal, LinkeSoep. After a terrific set at Club Fritz they decided to continue as a duo under the name Klank. Klank! Is a back2back set with an uplifting tempo in which deephouse and techhouse are the main influences. The duo has a deep connection with their audience so that they cause a heart stealing vibe. Hay-T's (1978) started when he was sixteen and got a job in a local bar where played tracks and taught himself to mix. After 3 years he bought his own decks. From that moment on Hay-T could be found on daily afternoon in the record shops in Amsterdam looking for the newest tracks. In 2006 he first spun during club nights in Odeon Amsterdam. It was the first time he appeared for a larger audience. In the same year Hay-T was cought by the upcoming music stream called minimal/techhouse. It was love at first sight, which made Hay-T decide to fully embrace this subgenre of house music. This was leading to gigs in clubs like, Flexbar, Aknathon, Club Home, Club 8,Exit Together with two good friends they decided not to waste any time setup a club night called \"Linke Soep\". After a few successful editions of Linke Soep, Hay-t organizes next to Linke Soep parties such as 4 Stunden, and Linke Fritz. Voldaan (1983) was exposed to house music through family. Voldaan grew up with classical music, which his dad taught him to listen to from on early age .. listening to the first house beats at age 12, Voldaan knew this was it for him. In 2007 Voldaan started his own club night called Club Fritz. After the first edition of this night it all went very quickly for Voldaan. After years of only having a wall as a listening ear, he finally got an audience which he could entertain with his tech house sound by spinning at parties in the Felxbar, Club Home, Studio 80, Club Stalker, Paradiso and Aknathon. Klank! Dj-sets With a constant drive and enthusiasm KLANK! stands for a set with continuous groove, and a lot of energy! ???",

Their aim is to bring high quality, organic sounds together with infectious grooves to the floor. \r\n\r\nWith their tracks released on labels like EC Records, Be As One and Alchemy, their sound is widely supported.

Find out in the full biography ;)\r\n\r\nSoundcloud\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/laktose\r\n\r\nFacebook\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/LaktoseNLSince his brother started to DJ at some local events, Lars got more interested in what his brother actually does behind the decks. After he found out what you can do on the mixer and CDJs he felt quite good on manipulating music and creating a atmosphere that energises people. He just liked to play with music and incrementally worked up his skill level. He promised himself never to play in front of people if he wasn’t confident he could play a proper gig. \r\nBut there was one thing missing, the inner feeling for the music, of you don’t feel it deep you can’t share it with the crowd they will notice sooner or later. Don’t get me wrong Lars played the records his brother bought and it was good music (Chicago House, Tech-House, Deep-House) but it wasn’t Lars. \r\nYears went by and Lars getting more interested in Techno music, at first a lot of different Techno music from Chris Liebing to Josh Wink and from Ben Sims to Perc. He discovered that Techno music for him was more to hear a journey of different sounds that exactly compement eachother. He started to listen closely to livesets of DJs like Ben Klock, Marcel Dettmann, Rødhåd, Adam Beyer, Ida Engberg and many others. And so on he created his way of what Techno music is all about, and like everybody else Lars still developing himself.  \r\nThis was at the end of 2013 and since then Lars changed his name from Greg Larsson to Laktose (a play on words referencing his own lactose allergy). Now he prefers to play deep melancholic detroit techno and very close relevant Techno from favorite labels such as Affin, Dystopian, Stockholm LTD, Ilian Tape etc. \r\nSince the beginning of his new direction as Laktose Lars played his techno at various local known venues and events like Il Cavo, Mondial, Pompgebouwen (Code Rood), Stoba (Taboe), Ernesto’s (a local alternative music bar and Taferelen hosts frequently party’s over there wich I performed for the third time last december) alongside local known and international famous DJs. \r\nTo record and share his development he starded a podcast Meraki in 2014. A name that describes Lars’s goal and journey trough music. Meraki means “The essence of yourself you put into your work. What actually means to put your soul in what you do. Since then Lars not only achieved a great development in his music style, also his way of living and thinking started to change in the person he is now! Music is an emotion.\r\n\r\nSince 2015 Lars is inviting fellow DJ’s he like to participate in his podcast.",

At her 21st she decided to get behind the decks herself after some years as party visitor. Since then she likes it so much she can express herself by playing the records.\r\n\r\nIn 2005 it really began for her, in that year, she experienced her first gig. She was sold immediately to the feeling reflecting from the public, by playing records that she love and where the public can go on loose .\r\n\r\nHer feeling plays an important role, that is why the sets are never the same.\r\n\r\nThe wide range and especially opinionated taste for different kinds of good music can be heard in her sets. Her DJ sets are very varied and depending on the concept of the party. They consist of minimal techno, from energetic sounds to some harder techno with alternating kicks and a dark raw undertone, an acid record won’t be feared. The feet won’t stop dancing.\r\nNothing is impossible!\r\n\r\nShe has played at several techno festivals across the country, next to many well-known names in the scene like: Miss Djax, 2 Junxion, Invite, Rick Angel, Peaky Pounder, Rude Awakening, Kriek, Mack, Hilarious, Mike Drama , Dave Miller, Damian Keane, Frank Kvitta ...",

  "artist_bio": "“There is an underlying order in this universe, which expresses itself in the form of numerical relations. This universal order is the basis of my music. I do this because I believe that when your music is based on this order, you can touch people in the most profound way.” - Lilith, July 2011Biography\r\n\r\nRising Dutch house and techno stalwart Lilith is showing herself to be as independent and as strong a force as her mythological namesake in today's increasingly complex musical climate. \r\n\r\nBorn Caroline Arends, the native Amsterdammer takes her sobriquet from the woman who, in Jewish mythology, was said to be Adam's wife (move over Eve). She left her husband as she felt too constrained and subservient to him – and it's that very same desire to be individual and different that drives this established musical virtuoso.\r\n\r\nFirst embracing the art and science of DJing in 2004, Lilith spent 7 years as one half of Naald & Draad, developing a weighty, bullshit-free groovy tech house sound that won her and her partner-in-crime great acclaim across her native country and continent.\r\n\r\n2010 was to be both the year they released their first record – the cheeky ‘From Blossom Till Dawn’ on Daniel Sanchez's acclaimed ‘Bla Bla Records’ – and the year they similarly parted company. \r\n\r\nAnd so in the summer of 2010, Lilith was born as a solo DJ and producer, with a story to tell and more importantly, a story very much worth hearing…\r\n\r\nFollowing on from playing at the best festivals her homeland NL has to offer (Mystery Land, Dance Valley, Welcome To The Future, Rockit Open Air) as well as gracing some of the World’s most respected club mainstays, such as Watergate, Chalet Berlin, Stereo Montreal, Melkweg, Toffler, Cat's & Dog's, We Are FSTVL and Ushuaia Ibiza, Art of Dark London and more, Lilith can proudly claim that she has held down a 2 year residency at Amsterdam's legendary bastion of all things underground, Studio 80 between 2010 - 2012. \r\n\r\nLilith also played an instrumental role in organizing the bi-monthly Warehouse parties at Rotterdam's Pakhuis, spreading the good word of house and techno across both of the country's major cities, and further proving both her affection and commitment to the industry.\r\n\r\nThroughout the years, she's played alongside heroes of the scene, from Jeff Mills to Guy Gerber, Karotte to Tobi Neumann, Ripperton to Gregor Tresher, Kerri Chandler to Dennis Ferrer and many more. Lilith is one of a minority of multi-faceted performers, with her trademark affinity of playing vinyls, to her equal ability to perform live, debuting her live act in July 2011 on the main stage at Have Nice Day festival to great acclaim.\r\n\r\nAs a hotly respected producer, her first release under the alias of Lilith, was ‘Angel's Love’, released on the legendary Monique Musique in 2011, and proved to be an even bigger success than she could have hoped for...It pointed a finger to a very bright career in the studio, while her strengths and popularity as a DJ continued to blossom thanks to her harmonically-tailored mixing skills and exquisite track selection. \r\n\r\nIn 2012 Lilith released a much anticipated and well-received \"Master Codes EP\" on Memoria Recordings, followed by a remix of Mike Montano's 'Copy vibe & Paste love' on Pins & Needles. \r\n\r\nReceiving ongoing support from the likes of  Marco Carola, Loco Dice & Dennis Ferrer, to name a few, Lilith divides her time between being locked up in the studio, working on her upcoming releases & playing some of the most revered music events across the world.\r\n\r\nLilith’s most current release 'Little Antennas', a collaboration with fellow Dutchman and Karton Label boss P.Jones, comes on ‘NoVus’, the new label imprint of London based duo Scott Kemp & Cris J. This intelligently crafted track forms part of the label’s debut VA, which also features astounding tracks from Deep Tech Records’ label boss Duky, and tINI & the Gang’s Randall M and Chad Andrew.\r\n\r\nNext-up for release in 2014 is the remixed edition of a 5 track mini-album, on one of London's most exciting and dynamic independent labels 'Art of Dark'. ‘Lagrimas del Sol’, is a collaboration between Lilith and Miami born and Berlin based talent David Gtronic, which fast became the label’s most successful release to date. The resounding popularity of the original release, which can only be defined as sophisticated, emotional and authentic techno of the highest order, has led to the album now being remixed by Kate Simko, Tomas Rubeck, Zefzeed, Ilario Liburni, DJ Medeew & Chicks Luv Us, and is due for release on January 27th 2014.  \r\n\r\nFully immersed in creating and promoting the music she loves so passionately, and with a swelling backlog of unreleased material eagerly waiting to be emancipated throughout the year, 2014 really is shaping-up to be the most memorable one yet, for this beautifully souled musician.",

  "artist_bio": "DJ/Producer. On a mission to unify genres and genders on the dance floor. Founder of Get On Down 'GOD' parties in Amsterdam, also Italo Elite, Acid Nouveau (11 rip), UNK and more.Unifying different people on the dance floor, DJ and producer LUPE carries out his mission through his music and parties. From the start at the heart of the Amsterdam club scene, he adds lyrics and vocals to electronica and beats for self-expression. Acid House and Disco are the main inspirations.\r\n\r\nHis first music release Shake was applauded by artists like Azari & III, Heidi, Tom Trago.\r\nLUPE crafts exclusives like the ReLuped edits and Love Tools for dj friends. Iconic producer Giorgio Moroder responded to an edit of a Donna Summer track: ‘Hello, Lupe! I really like and appreciate your edit. It has a great beat.’ \r\nLUPE is happy to have starred next to many artists he admires like Erol Alkan, Tiga, Hercules & Love Affair, Steffi, DJ T, Shinedoe, Alden Tyrell, Prosumer, Tama Sumo, San Proper, Miss Kittin, Honey Dijon, Booka Shade, DJ Haus, The Black Madonna and many more.\r\nHis exploration of electronic dance began with a Christmas present in his childhood: \r\na compilation album simply named Acid House on the Jack Trax label. Music took over and dancing was the only option…\r\nAged 16 he became a go-go dancer. Insatiably learning about artists and labels, he evolved from club kid to dance music connoisseur. He graduated in film studies and collected records. The visual side of his work developed.\r\nNine years later, LUPE decided to create fantasy worlds for others by deejaying.\r\nHe created many parties in his hometown Amsterdam since 2004. Their names speak for themselves: Get On Down, UNK, Italo Elite and Acid Nouveau.\r\nAt the infamous Dutch Golden Gnome Awards, his Italo Elite won the award for Best Party (2010), nominations for Best Newcomer DJ (2005) and Most Sexy DJ (2009).\r\nHe played at major Dutch venues and festivals like Trouw, Paradiso, Studio 80, 11(rip), 5DaysOff, Mysteryland, NOW&WOW, Dance Valley and ID&T’s Inner City.\r\nEven Madonna’s Sticky & Sweet Tour after party at Heineken Music Hall came along. Internationally he played at Exit Festival (Serbia), Dalston Superstore (London), Cookies (Berlin), The Hall (Istanbul) and many other venues.\r\n\r\nARTIST STATEMENT:\r\n‘I bring a new identity for dance, for men and women, straight and gay, black and white and so on. There is nothing to be scared of in each other. Nightlife is the designated area to overcome our differences in daily life, where we see each other free in a new light. Therefore I consider it an honor and a privilege to work in music and parties.’\r\nEnjoy the LUPE trip.\r\n\r\nEVENTS selection:\r\nIs Burning – 2015\r\nNow & Wow Fest 2012\r\nMilkshake Festival 2012\r\nExit Festival – Serbia 2012\r\n8Bahn Festival 2012\r\nAmsterdam Halloween 2012\r\nSTHLM – Stockholm 2011\r\nDalston Superstore - London 2010\r\nLoveland 2010\r\nDance Valley 2010\r\nBAF in Trouw 2009\r\nHQH at Cassero - Bologna 2008, 2009\r\nBerlin Hilton at nbi - Berlin 2007\r\nCookies - Berlin 2007\r\nGirlsLoveDeejays 2007\r\nInner City 2007\r\nSensation White 2007\r\nPutsch 2007\r\nRauw 2006\r\nMysteryland - 2006, 2008\r\nLFTFLD 2006\r\nLos Ninos - Brussels 2006, 2007, 2008\r\n5DaysOff 2006, 2007, 2008\r\nRESIDENCIES in Amsterdam past and present: \r\nUNK - Club 8\r\nZonde - Paradiso \r\nItalo Elite - Club Up\r\nAcid Nouveau - 11 Rip\r\nVoidd – Winston\r\nFashionRadio - Studio 80\r\nVreemd - Sugar Factory\r\nGalore - Sugar Factory \r\nParkroom - Flex Bar\r\nSale - Catwalk Club, Rotterdam\r\nGet On Down – various locations",

Starting out in the 80's with hip-hop and funk at local clubs in and around the city of Rotterdam, he soon started to pick up house music and started organising his own parties.Harry Lemon is a DJ/Producer in the true sense of the word. He's considered to be one of the more high-profiled producers of the Lowlands, but essentially he believes that DJ-ing shows more of his spirituality than anything he could ever put on vinyl. His aim is to put the magic and the spiritual energy of a good DJ-set into a record. Any record for that matter.\" Sometimes that magic moment could be at the beginning of an evening, at the end or somewhere in the middle. I try to put all those magic moments in a single track or split it in different ones\", he says.\r\n\r\nA lot of people worldwide know about LEMON8 as a producer but not that many people are familiar with the fact that he's an outstanding DJ in his own right too. Starting out in the 80's with hip-hop and funk at local clubs in and around the city of Rotterdam, he soon started to pick up house music and started organising his own parties. That way he met some influential DJ's while trying to get some openings for himself. It worked, and soon he had his big break by becoming resident at Holland's biggest and most influential club at that time; Nighttown, where he played for more then 4 years. During that time he created MODEL8 as an anthem for his 'own' crowd followed by 'the Bells Of Revolution' 2 years later, which almost entered the UK top 40 again last year. Harry has now played virtually every club in Holland with some of the best DJ's worldwide, whilst producing the finest dance tracks that became a soundtrack of a generation.\r\n\r\nAs we are well into the new millennium, Harry Lemon has set out to break new barriers with a series of records that all bare the same title; 'The Inner Sanctuary Sessions', to be releases in 6 (1) parts, each containing 2 tracks. He created a buzz with the first one containing 'Black 'n White World' and 'Tunnelvision', which made quite an Impression in the Progressive Scene worldwide. But it was after the release Inner Sanctuary 2 that he gained international respect with 'TRIPLE FUNK' and 'THE ONLY WAY', considered by most DJ's as a progressive landmark.\r\n\r\nHe now is one of the busiest remixers, with mixes for the most influential progressive labels the world over. On top of that he's releasing 2 different tracks on John Digweed's Bedrock label that will definitely put him on the A-list of DJ/ Producers worldwide.",

He has a popular progressive & tech house sound that fits well with the likes of John Digweed, Dave Angel or Dave Clarke.Lucien Foort has developed well over recent years as a producer and DJ. He has a popular progressive & tech house sound that fits well with the likes of John Digweed, Dave Angel or Dave Clarke.\r\n\r\nLooking back into the history books, Lucien Foort certainly had a well-educated musical background. His parents insisted that Lucien attend music school at the early age of 9, where he went on to achieve A.M.V. music training. He spent 8 years at music school combined with 5 years saxophone and orchestra education. All this music training certainly set him up to be able to tackle the most complex of musical compositions (and career – DJ’ing in key).\r\n\r\nLucien began djing at the tender age of 14, one Sunday afternoon at a friends house; asked of he liked it, he loved it and progressed from there. Beat Street was the first record Lucien ever bought and he was quickly on his way to spinning some great tunes. Club Carrerra in Rotterdam was the first club Lucien ever played at in 1994, from djing in his hometown to a diary full of dates all around the world.\r\n\r\nLucien took Holland by storm when he released the worldwide hit “Quadrophonia” back in ’89. This was a smash and sent Lucien around the world promoting it to all four corners of the globe. When it comes to production Lucien has remixed for labels such as Bedrock, Positiva, 3 Beat, Cyber recs and React. \r\n\r\nLucien is well known for his Dutch Liquid productions, which were favoured by the likes of Carl Cox, whereas his more progressive productions were under the name Funk Function. The Funk Function productions have been repeatedly licensed for many dj mix CDs, such as Sasha, Nick Warren, Dave Seaman and Seb Fontaine.\r\n\r\nOne of Lucien’s most famous remixes was for Dirty Vegas “Days Go By”; this track (in it’s original form) is currently on the Nike commercial all through America.\r\nLucien’s most recent remix was for Trisco “Ultra” on Positiva with plays from many radio dj’s, but most importantly Pete Tong.\r\n2001 – Saw Lucien as a monthly resident for Sheffield based club Gatecrasher. He was selected to play there for his progressive / tech house sound that was a great base for other successful dj’s to take the night onto complete hedonism. 2001 also saw Lucien play the main stage at Dance Valley which is a real honour for and DJ, playing in front of 50,000 out of the 100,000 that attended was as Lucien states “Awesome”. He was also a monthly resident for Dance Valley in Ibiza @ Amnesia playing with the likes of Billy Nasty and Michel De Hey. \r\n\r\nThis was also the year Lucien really developed his sound and status in Australia. He appeared on the Gatecrasher festivals throughout Australia with headliners Tall Paul, De La Soul and Roni Size, but it was the under dogs that the Aussies really loved and on many an internet message board the following day was he being praised for his style and flair. Lucien was also credited last year for his ability as a DJ, when he was nominated for a Muzik Magazine award for the “Best BBC Radio One Essential Mix” category.\r\n\r\nLucien mixed the Fluid Recordings compilation this year with Evolution, released back in Jan ’02 and licensed all over the world. Very pleased to be requested by Fluid as it has been a label that has delivered great productions that Lucien has been able to use in many a set.\r\n\r\nFollowing on from appearing at many festivals / events in 2001, he was again selected to play at 2002’s Homelands event. He also appeared at GCSSS in the Bedrock arena, finishing at the early hours of 6:00am, he was then chased by many who were in the audience to his car. Keen fans desperate to hear him spin again.\r\n\r\n2002 – is time for Lucien to be more studio based and also concentrate on developing himself in America. With constant requests from promoters and dj’s informing him of his demand this cannot be ignored. Vinyl in New York booked for this year with legendary club promoter Mike Bindra, Lucien is still excited and inspired by the industry he works in. \r\n",

  "artist_bio": "For booking requests and or release inquiries please email: lowpazz@garniche.nlLowpazz is a collaboration of two Dutch DJ/producers who independently operate under the monikers; KBM & Maxito. The musical objective of the initiative is to create a harmonious blend between House, and Techno music.\r\nThe trademark sound of Lowpazz can be described as a mix between Chicago, Deep, Tech, and old school Garage/Bass music. Their DJ sets are greatly influenced by nostalgic House-tunes, however they love to bridge the gap to more contemporary sounds. Good rhythmic structure is key, and musicality is a must. They always deliver, and a good night out is guaranteed.\r\n\r\nJay & Max met in Amsterdam during their studies in 2011. At first a collaboration seemed inconceivable due to their vast differences in musical taste. However they shared the principal values of a good composition, ingenious arrangement and a precious mix-down.\r\n\r\nLowpazz is always at the forefront of new technology, and isn't afraid to learn, \"We always try to use new techniques to make the music as original and instantaneous as possible\". The main objectives during their studies where to expand their musical knowledge and skill in production.\r\n\r\nAfter successfully completing both the audio engineering diploma at SAE Institute and their bachelors degree in audio production at Middlesex University their shared passion for electronic music won the battle of the genres and they have been blending their tastes ever since.",

  "artist_bio": "Stimulated by his father’s musical influence LoPoll grew up listening to rock and playing the guitar. He enjoyed his youth this way, but he always felt there was something more to life than sitting under the trees near his house, chewing strands of hay and playing his guitar. The introduction to electronic music proved to be a key moment in his life. On his first rave he experienced the overwhelming effect of Techno on himself, and more important; he noticed the influence a good DJ has on a crowd. Right there and then he realized he wanted to play that role himself. When he came home he traded his guitar for a pair of decks and went out to buy his first records. He practiced and practiced and soon taught himself to mix with three decks. His main influences are techno godfathers such as Jef..Since his first gig, more than ten years ago, LoPoll felt that for him, the most important aspect of mixing is the transfer of energy from the vinyl, through the speakers, to the crowd. To accomplish this transfer, LoPoll doesn’t simply fuse the separate grooves in the tracks he plays into one continuously kicking set. He interrupts the flow with carefully crafted breaks to keep the crowd on the edge of their dancing shoes with expectation.\r\n\r\nLast summer, celebrating his 10 year anniversary as a DJ, LoPoll made the next step in his musical career and started producing his own tracks. While he is still a novice in this field, his first tracks show he has the same approach to producing as he has to mixing; finding a harmony between the pumping kicks of techno and the funk of house.",

Inspired by the sounds from Soul, Jazz, Disco, Hip-Hop and R&B, Lewis heard the infectious groove from house music back in 1988 which got him convinced that the world needed to hear more sounds that represented love and happiness. When he saw DJ's play records together into one flawless mix (like Dutch dj-legends Marcello and Dimitri) he bought two turntables to get familiar with the techniques and created his own style of mixing. From playing Techno in the early years, commercial Clubhouse after that he discovered Deep, Soulful and Groovy house music that got him affected. Nowadays he is well known for his dj-sets that can be deep with a slight tech-vibe\r\nor, soulful with either jazzy vibes or groovy beats combined with nice vocals.\r\n\r\nThese days several cities around the globe have gotten familiar with the 'Deep, Soulful & Seductive' sound from Lewis Ferrier. One thing led to another, and just like starting as a DJ Lewis also has taken the step into creating his own music productions. Already released several tracks and remixes on some very respectable record-labels (Reelgroove, Look At You, Farriswheel Recordings, Soul Deluxe Recordings, Suntree Records, Déepalma Soul, Barcoda, Chega) he started his own record label in 2011: Stimulated Soul Recordings! Top producers, remixers and artists from all over the world have contributed to achieve the goal for his record label: Spreading Deep, Soulful & Seductive House Music! !",

  "cover_photo": "",
  "artist_bio": "M for momentum is the artist alias of Marijn van Laerhoven. The M is a reference to both his name and the word momentum, which is something he finds essential in music he dances to on a night out. The continues drive in the music that keeps one dancing for hours on end, it is then when Marijn finds the inspiration for his own productions.Marijn van Laerhoven is born in Amsterdam, the Netherlands on November 3rd in 1982. By the time he becomes a teenager, gabber house dominates the dance scene in Holland. It's aso around this time when Marijn enjoys himself hours on end with an old MS DOS program named Fast Tracker 2. His first experience with electronic music production. But then comes school, Microsoft Windows and gaming... \r\n\r\nIt’s not until years later when Marijn is introduced to techno. It’s the continues rhythmic drive that compels Marijn to return to dance floors of raves and festivals week after week. As he gets more involved in the music scene, Marijn starts to develop more and more musical ideas of his own. Never the ambition to play someone else’s records as a DJ, but all the more to create something that’s entirely his.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 Marijn finally picks up on his old yet not forgotten hobby. Music creation. From day one with the intention to one day be performing as a live act. It’s to no surprise that it’s love on first sight with Ableton Live. Already within months an opportunity arises to play for an audience at a private party. Although he’s only just getting started, Marijn does take the loops he’s created until then to play a set. The response is positive, and people encourage his initiative. It’s the impulse that launches the momentum. In the following year Marijn invests in an Apogee duet audio interface and KRK monitor speakers that would help him bring his productions to a higher level. Later he also buys Ableton Live Suite and the AKAI APC40 midi controller that totally matches with his plans for a live act. That live act would become M for momentum.\r\n\r\nWith a wide network of party people from all over Holland, Marijn is able to play M for momentum live gigs at Access Live Festival – Minimaal = Maximaal stage; the Nature One festival campsite in Germany; Arnhem initiative New Dutch School and Amsterdam’s EMMA. His sets exist out of nothing but improvised combinations of short clips of kick drums, bass lines, percussions, melodies and background sounds. It’s exactly how he foresaw his setup two years ago, but that was then. Times do change, ideas and beliefs evolve. By the end of 2010, Marijn comes to the inevitable conclusion that what has been freedom has now become a limitation. Time to move on.\r\n\r\nEarly 2011 Marijn rediscovers his sound and vision. Now focusing on producing tracks rather than loops, his new productions get more character, and a more distinctive style. It’s an evolution to a more grown-up sound and a brand new live set. Minimalistic yet dance floor proof. Hypnotic grooves, and an unmistakably dark mysterious edge. It is this, combined with his earlier vision of live improvisation, that will make M for momentum become a live act with an identity of it’s own. One with passion written all over it",

He was born and raised in Utrecht but quickly relocated to Amsterdam. Growing up in musical surroundings he got acquainted with vinyl very early on in his life, typical because “Frankie Knuckles goes to Hollywood - Two Tribes” was even his birthday song. Though he wasn’t allowed to touch his father’s precious Beatles records, if dad was out of sight for just a bit, Maarten was already practicing his DJ skills. Right then and there is where his addiction started.\r\n\r\nThe following years this ‘interest’ evolved into an uncanny love and passion for electronic music. He started working in the industry twelve years ago, build a solid network and is now promoting his very own festival Symphonica Elektronica, which gained a lot of attention with it’s exclusive five minute rave that spread quickly throughout the world. Artists like Trentemøller, Laurent Garnier and Dixon deeply influenced his way of experiencing music and pleasing crowds at big open air stages and venues like Paradiso, Melkweg and Tivoli.\r\n\r\nHis sound reflects his every day creative charm and enthusiasm, and therefore doesn’t have a fixed form. With his timeless interpretation of House music he always finds a way to be edgy and refreshing. Whether as a 3-hour warm-up set or late night gig, it’ll be packed with loads of energy (and women)…",

With\r\nthe live shows it's a totally different thing. I am more nervous because everything that\r\nwill come out of my setup is new, no recognisable tracks…only new material…and\r\nthat feeling for me is intense.”\r\n\r\nLose yourself in the music, to find yourself again. Rotterdam-based, but a\r\nshapeshifter of different dimensions, Louis Guilliaume loses himself in between the\r\ngrooves…caught in the space between one beat and the next…\r\n\r\nInfluenced by Detroit and Chicago, bred in school-of-hard-knocks Rotterdam, and\r\nlong-time resident playing dance and disco sets (E.D.D, NV Opslag and Bootleg DJ\r\nCafé – Rotterdam) since 1997, Louis Guilliaume has found himself now among label\r\nfamilies such as Skudge White, Syncom Data, Midnight Shift, Sound Travels, Teng\r\nRecords, Seldom Felt and Glasgow Underground.\r\n\r\nArmed with his choice of gear MPC2000XL with 8 outputs and an FX card, his tracks\r\nhave been described as “raw”, “drum machine aerobic” workouts and “pure electronic\r\nfunk from a gifted soul” – shuffling techno and house with vox samples, acid, sound\r\nFX and crunchy gravel underfoot picked up from his lost excursions. Rough on the\r\nexterior but with a soulful interior.\r\n\r\nTake for example his debut ‘Soulpoint’ LP, released on Syncom Data in 2008. Both\r\nwere created at a time when the producer had hit rock bottom. Recently dumped,\r\ndisappointed and filled with aggression, desires but fortunately for us, some hopes\r\nand dreams. Tracks like ‘Beyond the Stars’ and his own remixes (Syncom Lock mix\r\nand Heat of the Storm mix) stand out for these reasons.\r\n\r\nIn between first making scratches on his mother’s Mantovani records to his wellreceived\r\nproductions and performances at Berghain (Berlin), Sub Club (Glasglow) for\r\na mini Seldom Felt tour, and headlining and sharing a love for Bohannon with legend\r\nCarl Craig at the International Film Festival (Rotterdam, 2004), Louis also studied\r\nsound engineering at SAE and released a debut LP ‘Electronic Generation’ on his\r\nown label, Sonasty Productions in 2005.\r\n\r\n\r\nText by Debbie Chia",

So, how does one starts out by using cassette tapes to practice his mixing skills and then ends up being a much respected producer and an amazing DJ, putting out records and getting (international) support and recognition? What happened in between his first public performance at a R&B club in 2002 and his track Manejable being the official Latin Village Anthem in 2009, released on his own label Afrazoo.\r\n\r\nSoon after that first gig at a R&B club and realization that the urban crowd doesn’t feel his house music, Leroy got his first big break by getting a gig at Off-Corso, one of Rotterdam’s oldest & finest clubs. Rotterdam being his home town, Leroy grabbed this opportunity with both hands, playing as if his life depended on it. The stars must’ve aligned that night for Leroy and from that night on his career took off for real. Residency at successful club night Superstarz became a fact. Followed by regular gigs at other famous Rotterdam club (The Thalia) known for its tough and always critical crowd. His unmistakable skills and unique energy soon got noticed by one of the biggest clubs of The Netherlands (Now&Wow) where he became a resident DJ after only a few successful gigs!\r\nDetermined to bring “quality to the people”, Leroy Styles started a series of creative concepts of his own (Hufters, Electro Rockers) and in September 2006 his other concept LOOKS at The Thalia was born. Every last Saturday of the month he invited the best national and international DJ’s like Benny\r\nRodrigues, Brian S, René Amesz, Kenny Dope (USA), Dennis Ferrer (USA), Kerri Chandler (USA), Manoo (FR), D-Ramirez (UK), Jazzy Jeff (USA) and many more.\r\n\r\nNowadays Leroy’s name is on the bill of Holland’s biggest festivals and best clubs such as Panama (Amsterdam), The Thalia (Rotterdam), De Rechter (Eindhoven), Escape (Amsterdam), Jimmy Woo (Amsterdam), Now & Wow (Rotterdam), The Level (Arnhem), Off-Corso (Rotterdam) and many more. He also frequently plays abroad, and is particularly keen on South America and\r\nFrance, but who knows where his next record will take him?\r\nSpending all of his (non existing) spare time in the studio, Leroy Styles is producing like a mad man. His 2007 ‘Booty Bass (dream)’ became a Dutch club classic almost instantly, causing serious damage on the dance floor. Followed by ‘Jus Bounce’ that caught D-Ramirez’ attention and was featured\r\non his Ministry of Sound compilation cd in 2007. Gaining huge support by worlds finest DJ’s such as Jack de Marseille, Roger Sanchez, Sander Kleinenberg, Rene Amesz, Benny Rodrigues and Steve Angello. ‘Jus Bounce’ also appeared on a Renaissance album, mixed by Paolo Mojo. This fantastic\r\n80-minute Renaissance mix includes tracks from Paolo Mojo himself, Joris Voorn, Cirez D, Blue Foundation, Daso, Sebo K, Loco Dice and many more. Another Leroy track, God Will Set Me Free (feat. MC Crown), is featured on a Defected In The House Amsterdam 09 compilation.\r\nWith a list of (upcoming) releases on his own label Afrazoo, Gregor Salto’s label G-Rex, Sidney Samson’s Samsobeats and Kerri Chandler’s (US) Grey Matter Records, with Manoo, Sunnery James & Ryan Marciano, Geneiro Nvilla, Glowinthedark en Jaquelino Ferreira lining up to do a remix of his tracks, this talented producer/DJ is definitely here to stay.\r\n\r\nConsider yourselves warned!",

Er wordt een professionele dj-booth opgebouwd, feest gevierd en de boel wordt weer opgeruimd en netjes achter gelaten. Tijdens het feest worden beelden via camera opgenomen en live uitgezonden via het internet.\r\n\r\nDaarnaast doet Roger al vele jaren vrijwilligers werk bij stichting SCN en leert hij kinderen alles op het gebied van electronische muziek.

  "artist_bio": "LIFE on MARS: \"Interplanetary Music\"\r\n\r\nThe two aerospace engineers behind this project Tim Miles & Jaap de Laat are both very familiar with space and its mystery’s. Miles has a history of experimenting with radio waves and people say that Jaap actually sent his hamster into orbit. They both met during a lecture on Rocket Motion, which is where they also decided to take over the universe.\r\n\r\nTheir plan of attack? Expose the general population to a high dose of what is known as interplanetary music. Their favorite quote is: it’s not a matter of ‘if’ but ‘when’.\r\nThe dynamic combination of Jaap de Laat and Tim Miles, previously known as Flavourables. In January of 2013, after long deliberation, Jaap and Tim decided to change their DJ and producer moniker to LIFE on MARS. Not a decision to be taken lightly as they were finalist in the biggest producer contest in The Netherlands [Vinylized, 2011] and had also won the Prestiges Amsterdam Dance Event Next’s Talent award [also 2011] with their previous moniker Flavourables. As well as playing in quite a few of the bigger venue’s in Amsterdam & Rotterdam [Air, Perron, Studio 80, Club NL, Catwalk and Panama] and their international adventures in Germany [Mainz], Italy [Yacht Week residency] and Australia [Sydney].\r\n \r\nBut not to worry! The change is for the better. Now, the name reflects what the duo plays: A mysterious deep blend of house music that will take you to outer space. With the first release already signed to Berlin-based Natural Rhythm, a label owned by Horatio and their first festival gig at Soenda festival lined-up, LIFE on MARS is off to a flying start!",

  "artist_bio": "M.E.N.N.O.\r\n\r\nReal Name: Menno van der Lubbe\r\n\r\nAge: 37\r\n\r\nEmail: info@djmenno.com\r\n\r\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/mennopoolside\r\n\r\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/070menno\r\n\r\nBuy on Beatport: http://dj.beatport.com/mezzoBiography: M.E.N.N.O.\r\n\r\nA dynamic figure whose keen music sense is matched only by his virtuosity at the turntables and unstoppable sense of right in the studio. Carrying the banner of MEZZO, this initiative and way of life he started in 2001, Menno has traveled around The Netherlands and conquered each port. He's done so with a raise-the-roof party mentality. A strong dose of art and live artists, and the chunky, funky house sound that is so unique to him that its described as \"MEZZO\"\r\n\r\nMenno was born in The Hague (NL), so his musical footing is appropriately in Urban, Dance, House and Garage. He started DJ-ing at the age of 13, and his hunger for music soon brought him from DJ gigs, to studio engineering classes at the Liquid Lab. Eventually he showed up as a resident-DJ of ASTA (NL), Bahia Imperial (IT), Cocoon (NL), Club XS (NL), and Buddha Bar (NL/ FR). These preeminent mainstream Clubs of the time, bearing his own musical perception, which he admits wasnt always that good. But after a string of rejections, he presented Cocoon with an ethnic energy concept called \"MEZZO\" under the moniker of \"MEZZO Club night\", a blend between musicians playing live and a DJ. That got signed, and was soon followed by huge outdoor dance events with international DJ's like Shapeshifters, Laidback Luke, Erick E, Lucien Foort, Dimitri, Mark van Dale, Sander Kleinenberg and Roog. Gigs so huge that people who dont know a damn thing about dance music could hum together all night. Menno still didn't took over the pop charts all across the world, but this young DJ/ Promoter is reaching for the top!\r\n\r\nEmboldened by his success, Menno launched MEZZO in 2001 after almost a year of prep. During that time, he fussed with logos, packaging, and every detail of the look, feel, and function of the organization, all with the goal of \"standing out from the herd.\" But he never had to waffle on the musical policy - guided by Mennos ear and live presence, and bolstered by his equally able teammates Sean McCafferty and Walter Pedro, the sound of Mezzos artists has been consistent yet always different, an amalgam of disco, soul, funk, and house, both vocal and instrumental, thats as underground as it is party-ready.\r\n\r\nThree years later MEZZO has several events and a weekly club night. Its not been enough for Menno. Because in addition to being a promoter, producer, remixer and CEO, hes one hell of a DJ. Prompted by the success of the Wednesday weekly party he started in Cocoon, The Hague, The Netherlands (also called \"Mezzo Clubnight\"), Menno took the vibe on the road, testing out the strength of his events like the annual MEZZO at Billabong Beach, Scheveningen, NL. During summer 2003, and at his own coveted residency at Cocoon (hes one of few DJ's to ever hold one). That summer, MEZZO hold court each Wednesday at The Hagues TABU nightclub, featuring Menno working his records collection and mixer to the bone alongside internationally renowned DJs like Frederik & Pako, Stef Vrolijk, Ramon, Dimitri, Laidback Luke and Wessel van Diepen. The residency was already highly decorated: MEZZO was named \"Club night of the month (ID&T magazine) of February 2004. Also Menno was named \"Star Dj of The month\" in January 2004 (Pioneer dj contest). His dearest friend Mark van Dale, whos resident at Escape Venue, Amsterdam on Sunday, invited Menno to the weekly club night \"Sundae\" ones and after that gig a long lasting collaboration took place at the capital of Holland. For the first time Menno has broken lose of all prejudices and made the club on a Sunday explode with his funky chunky house music. So then Menno has two residencies and a lot of events to hold on to. With the years Menno has become a recognized key player in the Dutch club scene and an outstanding DJ and Promoter. That year hes also added a live component, inviting vocalists like \"Rose\" (United, NL) and \"Paul T \"(Combined Forces, NL), and rising stars like \"Dez\" (United, NL) to perform their tracks for the Dutch beach massive.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 Menno got signed with Ministry of Sound as a Tour Manager Middle East and moved to Sharm El Sheikh to manage three events a week in the outstanding outdoor location PACHA In Egypt he became a Tour Manager with a lot on his mind. The challenge to make profit with the events was made but a lack of security made the job impossible. Due to a poor collaboration with both parties Menno desided to come back to the Netherlands. He striked back and found a job with the one of the best national event organization; ID&T as head of internet radio stations Dance-Tunes, Sensation & Q-Dance radio. Althought that didn't work out like it was originally planned. Menno got noticed by the director of Fresh FM and got signed with Fresh FM in August 2008 and enjoyed his position as account manager and as a sidekick of the weekly Flitsende 50  with Peter van Leeuwen. This made Menno deside he would like to do more with this kind of work. Making radio is something he never thought about earlier but this was where he would like to go. Less clubbing and more radioshows. Although the residency with the weekly clubnight Mellow Moods on tuesdays in the last ten years with international and national top Djs like Michel de Hey, Afrojack, Hardwell, Lucien Foort and many others and three 'all night' gigs as a resident at 't Maliehuisje' in The Hague, Menno didn't make it to the top yet. \r\nExpanding his market value due to the radio he's been searching for a new partnership with a producer to make his first E.P. The influence of all the international dance experiences made Menno curious about making an own studioalbum. Promises to himself will make Menno realise that he must work hard on all fronts and beyond. In February 2014 his first E.P. 'Montevideo' will finally be released on Poolside Recordings in collaboration with Dj Jeroenski. \r\nAlso has been performing in Barcelona, Mallorca, Sharm el Sheikh and beyond. And on the seventh day, perhaps he'll rest but probably not..",

  "artist_bio": "A major force in second dawn of The Netherlands’ dance music, Leon Bolier is one of the most creative studio minds at work in the country today. Bolier has long since taken the music out of the studio and to the people. Playing hundreds of nights, and in front of hundreds of thousands of clubbers, this mission culminated in Bolier debuting on DJ Magazine’s Top 100 chart in the autumn of 2008.A major force in second dawn of The Netherlands’ dance music, Leon Bolier is one of the most creative studio minds at work in the country today. Bolier has long since taken the music out of the studio and to the people. Playing hundreds of nights, and in front of hundreds of thousands of clubbers, this mission culminated in Bolier debuting on DJ Magazine’s Top 100 chart in the autumn of 2008.\r\n\r\nGoing Solo: After a number of highly successful tracks co-produced with his brother Bart under the Subsphere moniker, Leon launched his standalone production career in 2005. Over the course of the next 12 months he released a head-spinning (and possibly record-breaking) 17 tracks. In 2006 he embarked on a label relationship that is now singularly synonymous with his career. ‘Pulsar’ and ‘Solar 1’ were released through the Spinnin’ sub-label 2Play, and over the course of the next 3 years Bolier was to put out an extraordinary 20 tracks through the label.\r\n\r\nThe Turntablist: After a busy ‘06 on the release front 2007 was the year he entered the DJ realm. Bolier’s innate ability to read the dancefloor and deliver damage-to-order has now become the stuff of legend. Leon fast found himself, headphones-in-hand, rocking countries as far apart as Argentina, Singapore, Mexico, Australia, UK, Egypt and Russia. This 24-month-long gig marathon bore the best possible fruit when Leon was inducted into the spinning elite’s DJ Mag Top 100 DJ rundown in October 2008, debuting at No.95.\r\n\r\nCollaborations & Remix Aliases: Aside from Subsphere, Bolier has worked under many different guises for both solo and collaborative production work. He teamed up with Menno de Jong under the name Solar Express in 2006 for the ‘Magma’/Momentum’ and latterly as 'Bolier and Coenraad for Intuition’s ‘Mighty Ducks’ and ‘Mohawk’. He has also collaborated over the years with fellow Netherlanders including Jonas Steur, Sied van Riel and DJ Astrid and co-op’d with JOOP on ‘The Future’, which became the Trance Energy anthem in 2007.\r\n\r\nThe Debut Album: With its ‘Ocean Drive Boulevard’-forerunner setting the once-again wide-ranging tone, Bolier’s ‘Pictures’ LP captured the collective imaginations of clubbers and electronic dance lovers. Upon its release at the end of September 2008, it translated into Beatport smash and has gone on to spawn the further singles ‘Thug’, ‘XD’, ‘YE’ & ‘Acapulco’.\r\n\r\n‘Streamlined 2009 – Buenos Aires’: Galvanized by his South American tour in the spring of the same year, he returned home to mix ‘Streamlined 2009’ – his first solo compilation. Subtitled ‘Buenos Aires’, it stands as the clearest possible representation of what makes Bolier one the most exciting, innovative Decktitions in the world today.",

Bekend van: Lowlands, Mysteryland, ADE, Pitch, Valtifest, Solar, Discovery en grote clubs als Paradiso, Melkweg, Trouw, Club Up, AIR, Gashouder, Sugar Factory, OT301, Effenaar, 013, Tivoli en Ekko.In 2005 tijdens een trip naar Berlijn ontdekken Sanne en Elant een gedeelde smaak voor muziek wat in datzelfde jaar leidt tot het ontstaan van dj duo Lustige Lola & Weltschmerz. Het tweetal wordt gekenmerkt door een gemeenschappelijke liefde voor electronische muziek en de nachtelijke sferen daaromheen. Muzikaal gezien brengen ze een stevige nieuwe discosound. Het is een poppy mix van nu-disco en house, met een aanstekelijke drive; energiek, warm en vrolijk.\r\n\r\nHun enthousiasme heeft een ontwapenende uitwerking op het publiek en ze weten op een unieke manier een volwassen geluid te brengen zonder af te doen aan de dansbaarheid.\r\n\r\nInmiddels zijn Lustige Lola & Weltschmerz een vaste waarde in het nachtleven; met stijl, smaak en charisma. Als residents van de Dog Day Disco avonden in Paradiso zijn ze voorlopers met een sterk geloof in “disco in de disco”, iets dat ze al predikten op menig festival.\r\n\r\nZowel muzikaal als qua ambitie blijven Lustige Lola & Weltschmerz zich doorontwikkelen. Als new talent in de ADE special van DJBroadcast en hun laatste Mysteryland mix online bij 3VOOR12 ligt de wereld aan hun voeten.\r\n\r\nOp hun trackrecord staan festivals als Lowlands, Mysteryland, ADE, Pitch, Valtifest, Solar, Discovery en grote clubs als Paradiso, Melkweg, Trouw, Club Up, Gashouder, Sugar Factory, OT301, Effenaar, 013, Tivoli en Ekko.",

  "artist_bio": "He needs no introductions or credits. All you need to know about Levi Verspeek is that he is not the same person as Rhadoo, even though their similar appearances deceive even the most professional musicologists. Though not (yet) as famous in Romania, Levi is one of the most familiar names in the Amsterdam.This is partly because in 2013 'Levi' was the second most popular baby name in the Netherlands and partly because Levi himself started popping up behind the decks at some of the most prestigious parties in and around Amsterdam. If the dance, or better, techno scene can be compared with a man’s life, Levi saw this former child rising up and nourished it like a caring mother. Like a wonderfully caring mother.\r\n\r\nHis relationship with machinery started to show at an early age. At the age of 22 he already had his first release on Body Parts: Hans EP. His grooving, driving and freaking sound already started to garner attention from artists like Raresh. Through his straddles and waggles around the town, Levi got kidnapped by Makcim, a bodybuilder turned DJ from Russia. Together they started producing tracks, involving themselves in obnoxiously real and sweat-drenched basement-raves and taking early morning walks through the streets of western Amsterdam. Their combined ideologies jelled the definitive and futurist sharp-cut Daan de Pup EP, which was to be released on the prestigious Raum Musik. He is currently working on an EP for the Dutch label RUIS and is cooking up even more wonderful music. So don't sleep on Levi, that's not comfortable.",

Malin soon released more music on SlapFunk Records, another Dutch label, with the Sancta Simplicitas EP also dropping in 2012.\r\n\r\nOne particular track hooked fellow DJ/producer Charlie Naffah aka Lazare Hoche, who approached Malin Genie to release music through his label Lazare Hoche Records. From there, the two became fast friends and collaborators, resulting in the co-produced “Formes” and “I Don’t Sync So” EP’s. Shortly after, another DJ and producer Samuel Andre Madsen aka S.A.M. joined, with the three producing under the name Mandar and co-owning the label Oscillat. Whether separate or with their powers combined, the members of the trio have proved to be some of the freshest new blood in the scene, with Mandar debuting a live set in early 2015.",

On Lumberjacks in Hell he has released more than 15 records with hits such as Rayko’s “All Around The Watchtower” and the 2 x 12” Compilation “Chicago Service” featuring the ubiquitous “Hit It N Quit It”.\r\nHe uses Intimate Friends as a vehicle to release his own productions and also close friends such as NY*AK, Roman Rauch and Borrowed Identity (all due in 2015). His sought after Em Vee edits can be found on various labels across the board.\r\nNext to his residencies in Amsterdam, Marcel has toured the US, Australia and regularly plays for crowds all over Europe.",

  "artist_bio": "Maketoire was born in Keene, New Hampshire in 1990 and moved at an early age to Holland. He lived in a village near The Hague and started spinning records at his room when he was 13 years old. After a year or two he discovered that electronic music was his love and passion. He started playing at clubs in and around The Hague and Leiden. But most of the time he played at private parties, making long sessions behind the deck and giving the audience a diverse sound of house and techno.At the age of 17 Maketoire decided to move and go study in Amsterdam. Since then he became familiar with the Amsterdam party scene. Visiting clubs like Club 11, Studio 80, Melkweg and Paradiso. After he was listening the ultimate masters Raresh and Ricardo Villalobos playing an amazing back to back set at Static, Club 11.  Maketoire made up his mind and knew that this was what he wanted to do.\r\n\r\nNow Maketoire is going to parties all over the world listening to his inspirators such as Arpiar, Luciano, Reboot, Richie Hawtin, Loco Dice, Tobi Neumann, Ricardo Villalobos and Cassy. Making hours and hours at his room in Amsterdam and trying to make his dream come to true and become a master behind the decks.\r\n\r\nIn two years (2011) Maketoire wants to be a well respected Dj in Amsterdam. His ingredient to accomplish this is his diverse variation between house, techhouse and techno. Being the youngest Dj at the Carnivale Agency with an age of 19, Maketoire is determined to show the Amsterdam underground scene what he’s got.",

An eye-opening moment that made him realize there was much more in life than just angry music.\r\nFrom then on he started to explore the infinite world of musical differences, this time with an open mind.\r\n\r\nMark’s musical endeavors took him decades back in time, finding essential music dating back as far as half a century – music that proved to be timeless in spirit and soul. The importance of collecting the history of music that makes house music what it is today is enhanced by his love for vinyl. Though not dismissive of newer technologies Mark wants to feel his way through music by tracing all the connections to and variations of psychedelic rock, afro, funk, soul-freejazz, punk, wave, disco, house, electro and techno to the deeper shades of modern house music. Slabs of vinyl are his ultimate mediator.(N.N.)\r\n\r\n",

Those who know the Dutchman personally, know this can be accreditted to his ‘nonconformity’ and ‘hard work’. Those values have been the foundation of the young talent’s quick establishment in an already saturated electronic dance music market. A multifaceted talent, his productions have been released on labels such as Stealth and Armada and gathered the support of the industry’s largest names.\r\n\r\nStarting off in a small town near Amsterdam, Mark developed a fascination for music at age 7 when he discovered his grandparents’ record collection. In his early teens, he was drawn in by house culture and quickly purchased his first set of decks. Inspired by house legends such as Carl Cox and Jeff Mills, Mark was soon performing frequently in local clubs and started music production as further means of artistic expression.\r\n\r\nToday, Mark is solidifying his reputation as a performer. His live repertoire largely consisting of his own tracks, classified as stylish yet flirty, he has played almost every major club in The Netherlands and in over 7 countries internationally.

  "artist_bio": "Somehow, against all odds a leafy quiet town in the north west of Holland has spawned an artist who’s passion for real house music, and determination in the studio has made him clearly stand out amongst his peers.Man Without A Clue - officially the only new house music artist to have collaborated with 3 of the true originators of the sound, legends; Todd Terry, Kenny Dope & Roger Sanchez, who've all welcomed him into the scene with open arms, naming him the number 1 producer to continue delivering the raw NYC house sound they pioneered.\r\n\r\nWith releases on Defected, Dopewax, Skream’s Of Unsound Mind label & Suara under his belt, and new projects on Tough Love’s Get Twisted Records & Love & Other, the Dutch producer is fast becoming a force to be reckoned with; his clear trademark sound that draws a heavy influence from the old skool, yet manages to sound completely fresh gives him a unique position in the scene.\r\n\r\nA defining moment for Man Without A Clue was his track “When I Play This Record” dropping on Defected's sister label DFTD, Stated as the ‘biggest underground record of Ibiza 2014’ by DMC and supported by the a-list of house heavyweights. The MWAC movement is also being championed by BBC Radio 1’s Danny Howard, Hannah Wants, Low Steppa, Mark Knight, Tough Love, Stacey Pullen, Maya Jane Coles and many more.. \r\n\r\n2015 has already seen the launch of Clueless Music with the single “Morning”, a week in the studio in NYC with Kenny Dope during which they worked on a number of new records for Dopewax, a huge remix for Soul Divide’s “Catch The Light” and new projects with Mr V, Rae and Kevin Knapp all underway. \r\n\r\nThere’s no stopping this young talent as he aims high.. shoots and scores.\r\n\r\n\"I spotted MWAC a couple of years ago and knew he would be a force 2 be reckoned with in the new House Movement. His beats & Basslines are super tight & he ups his game with every release\"  ROGER SANCHEZ",

  "artist_bio": "Dj | Producer | Music loverMarc Creemers (1985), born in the southern part of the Netherlands, is the youngest of three brothers in his family. As a child, he learned a lot about music from his two brothers. Thanks to them, his love for electronic music started to grow at a young age. Not only was he fond of 80’s and 90’s house, he loved the sounds and tunes produced by synthesizers and drum computers in other genres as well.\r\nDuring his school career, Marc and his walkman were inseparable. He was always discovering a variety of new music and fresh sounds. His taste ranged from lounge to techno, and everything that could be found in between.\r\nAround his 18th birthday, Marc bought his first turntables, which lead to a lot of practicing in his bedroom. He would do that for hours, just to learn the ropes of the trade. Around that time, he started to play his first gigs at regional clubs. His performances did not go unnoticed: the regional gigs were quickly followed by bookings in Belgium and Germany. \r\nAs he got older, the urge to produce his own sound got bigger. While working with all sorts of genres over the years, he discovered a sound close to his heart: deephouse. \r\nMarc has been producing his own records since 2009, with which he produces his own distinguishable sound. His productions are characterised by a lot of smooth sounds and deep bass lines, topped off with techno-influenced details",

Making any club vibrate and move with the industrial energy that only a pure dedicated mind like his, can provide us with.\r\n\r\nHomeland \r\nHis homeland, Vigo is an industrial city located in the north-west coastline of Spain. Big ships, trucks and industries have filled his senses and imagination since long. His dedication to techno was, since very young, one of the greatest aspects of his life. A great and solid musical base, and without a doubt, a big dose of talent, gave him the chance to perform since the year 2000 as a resident in the well known Opera, located in Vigo. After the shutdown of this club, Manu became the new resident of Moloko for the next four years. \r\n\r\nAbroad \r\nWith so many experience, presence and reviews in the scene, it does not take long till the doors of other big and prestigious clubs in Spain open for him. He then performs in clubs and festivals like Festidance, El Jardín, Octopus, La Real, Delfos, and many more. This is also the time when Manu starts performing outside the boarders of Spain, ln many places in the neighbor country Portugal. Soon after this, he moves to London where he performs in several clubs such as The Mass, The Rocket, and 1001 Cafe. \r\n\r\nAmsterdam\r\n Always in his search for more and more techno, he moves from London to Amsterdam back in 2008, where he still lives nowadays. In these years he has of course performed in multiple clubs and festivals around The Netherlands like Pact Festival, Fuck you where in Eindhoven, Club home, Twstd, Area 51 and others. \r\n\r\nDirect Drive \r\nThis year 2013 has brought for this DJ and Producer a new and exciting project. Along with three other DJs, he has started Direct Drive. A new and revolutionary techno party starting up in the city of Amsterdam, assuring loads of fun and pure techno for the lucky ones in the city, and hopefully soon for many more across the Globe.\r\nIn all these years, Manu Martin has shown his quality lining up with some of the biggest DJ’s in the scene such as Derrick May, John Digweed, Dave Clarke, Alexander Kowalsky, Adam Beyer, Heiko Laux, Chris Liebing, Oscar Mulero. and many more ...",

In the 90s, as a teenager, he discovered the sound of Underworld, Leftfield, Orbital and The Future Sound Of London, knowing he was going to devote his life to this kind of music. Later on,his first visits to the clubs gave him the idea to start producing his own music. \r\n\r\nAt the age of 18 he started to produce his first beats, and in 2003 he became the resident dj in some of Krakow's clubs. \r\nLater on he moved to the Netherlands where he started playing in local clubs as well as gigs in Amsterdam and other parts of the Netherlands; at the same time he was polishing his production skills. \r\n\r\nIn 2011 he released his first EP on Pets Recordings, a label of his polish mates Catz n Dogz who believed in him and wanted to give him a platform to release his debut EP which turned out to be a great starting point for his career. \r\nIn 2012 he released tracks on Electronique Records and on the legendary Nurvous Records which reached Top 50 on Beatport Charts and were charted, supported and played by dj's like  M.A.N.D.Y, My Favorite Robot and others, have placed him on the musical scene for good.\r\nHis future releases, as collaborations with rising talents from Switzerland and the Netherlands as well as his original tracks, will hopefully allow Martin to finally establish his name amongst the most respected producers out there.",

And when he’s not inspiring the clubbing crowds from the vinyl decks, you’ll find him releasing quality tunes on Amsterdam imprint Remote Area, Raum Musik or Apollonia together with his music partner-in-crime, Levi.Just like the vodka from his birthplace, Moscow-born Dutch-resident MAKCIM always fuels the party spirit with his intoxicating and powerful sets, mixing house and techno to create refreshingly deep and sexy grooves. \r\n\r\nA colourful childhood in Russia, painted with the sounds of Joy Division, Talking Heads, Depeche Mode, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Blondie, Pink Floyd as well as jazz greats Miles Davis and Marcus Miller, meant that by the time MAKCIM moved to the Netherlands, at the age of 12, he knew music was going to be a huge part of his life.\r\n\r\nBy 1996, inspired by the house scene, he started buying records each week and by 1999 at the age of 20, he got his first residency in a club in Eindhoven. At the same time he began organising illegal parties and together with friends and founded a new platform called ‘Minimal Eindhoven’ which became fundamental to the Dutch house & techno scene.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Amsterdam imprint, Remote Area, welcomed MAKCIM together with his music partner in crime, Managemend (aka Roel van Otterdijk), into the fold with the release of their first EP “Lithe”. Their collaborative genius was a powerful mix, blending MAKCIM’s perfection for cool and funky rhythms with Managemend’s brilliance for creating chunky, deep, soulful loops. It’s therefore no surprise that they’ve since been regular guests on the label with their 2nd EP ‘Red Aglet’ and track “Hid” released on the label’s debut album in 2009, then again in 2010 with the release of their EPs “Boyism” and “Fur Cage”. \r\n\r\nEach release unique, but always taking you on a quality sound journey to the deeper, funkier side of techhouse life with sexed up steamy vocal snippets and chunky rolling rhythms which continue to tick all the right boxes for the DJ likes of Ricardo Villalobos, Margaret Dygas, Richie Hawtin, tINI, Luciano….\r\n\r\nAnd now, when MAKCIM is not in the studio with friend and production partner Levi Verspeek crafting new tunes, he can be seen and heard spinning vinyl at Berlin’s Club der Visionaere and Hoppetosse as well as in party hotspots across New York, Moscow, London, Paris and Ibiza.\r\n\r\nCloser to home you’ll find him moving the Dutch clubbing crowds with long and sexy sets at venues such as Melkweg, Studio K, Paradiso, Studio 80 and Trouw, as well as being a regular at festival greats such as Lowlands, Awakenings, Voltt, 5 Days Off, Static, Innercity, Loveland, Buiten Westen, Mysteryland and Welcome to the Future Festival.\r\n\r\nWith new releases on Raum Musik, Apollonia and VBX and gigs in the pipeline, it’s as clear as vodka that if you want to get funked up, then MAKCIM will mix you a perfect cocktail of house and techno tunes for deep and long all night party play.",

  "artist_bio": "Dutch producer Maxi Mill has a distinct sound all of his own. Spacious and futuristic, yet dripping with analogue warmth and the infectious, off-kilter swing of MPC-programmed drums, his productions sound like an honest but evocative blend of the past, present and future.Maxi Mill likes vivid analogue synthesizers, rolling grooves, sweaty Chicago jack tracks and far-sighted, intergalactic melodies inspired by the techno futurism of Detroit. He makes music for dancing and daydreaming; sometimes, as on debut single “To The Next” and 2013 gem “Lost & Found”, you’ll find yourself doing both at the same time.Born and raised in Amsterdam, Maxi was introduced to music at an early age by his Indian father and Dutch mother, whose early life was informed by her father’s involvement in COBRA, a pan-European arts collective of free-thinking radicals founded shortly after the Second World War. Maxi credits his emotional, open-minded production style to the free thinking approach to life passed on by his parents and Grandfather, Constant. “There’s no theoretical approach,” he says. “I just make what I feel.” Maxi’s musical journey began in earnest when he fell in love with hip-hop aged 13. Trips to the Fat Beats record shop in Amsterdam ignited a life-long love affair with crate digging, and opened his eyes to the music that inspired his favourite hip-hop producers – a classic blend of disco, funk and soul, with a side order of bustling breaks from weird and wonderful rock, Afrobeat and Latin records.\r\n\r\nAs he grew up, his attention turned more towards house and techno. He was already an accomplished beatmaker, knocking out Kindred Spirits style experimental soul and hip-hop beats, but now he had a new focus. Utilizing his collection of analogue synths and drum machines – paid for through endless hours working as a chef in his home city – he began to create pulsating, stargazing house and techno tunes.In between late night sessions locked in his studio, he’d hook up with friends from the Amsterdam scene, fellow producers such as Young Marco, San Proper, Awanto 3 and, of course, Tom Trago. Like others in the scene, he relishes the chemistry that comes from like-minded friends having fun. It was through these regular studio and DJ sessions that he found himself signed up to Tom Trago’s Voyage Direct imprint, the label he runs with Amsterdam heavyweights Rush Hour. Maxi has already released two 12” singles through the label, with a third due later in 2014. \r\n\r\nHaving long since abandoned his job as a chef to concentrate on making music and DJing – his other great passion – there’s a feeling that Maxi is on the verge of a great breakthrough. He has a series of solo and collaborative releases lined up for 2014, and is beginning to get DJ bookings around Europe. After such an intense, impressive apprenticeship, there’s no doubt his time has come.",

(now label owner and dj as well) \r\nThere Michael started to mix music with vinyl under the name of Dj T.A.B! \r\nAfter a short learning process he became the resident of these events that took place in the community/youth centre that time. \r\nAfter a few months of playing Techno and a little hardtechno he found \r\nsomething complete different!

  "artist_bio": "Michel is one of the people who took responsibility for dance music and its direction on the local Rotterdam scene. With his talent both as a producer and as a DJ, Michel opened the door to techno and techhouse for generations of clubbers.Biography: \r\nMichel de Hey must be seen as one of the people who took responsibility for dance music and its direction in Rotterdam. With his talent both as a producer and as a DJ, Michel opened the door to techno and tech house for a lot of people. Over the years Michel succeeded to get a solid reputation abroad through his excellent DJ performances at clubs, parties and festival events across the globe. \r\n\r\nHis DJ career kicked of in 1986 and with his first recording release 'Break' he entered the Top 10 of the US Billboard Dance Charts. Since then, Michel de Hey developed his funky techno sound to what it is today. Many times Michel has been nominated for national dance awards such as the LSDA Awards, the TMF Nokia Awards and the Update Dance Awards. Over the years Michel de Hey has won the award for Best Techno DJ of the Netherlands for four times already! \r\n\r\nSince the beginning of 2003 he started to work together with the former Cosmack Management in London, now called Litheum Bookings. They are now responsible for all his dj activities outside the Benelux. Next to Michel they also take care of dj’s like Carl Cox, John Digweed, and Jimmy van M. \r\n\r\nOver the last decennium Michel founded various record labels such as EC, CC, Brave New World, Miracle Records and HEY! Records. . EC Records delivered several floor fillers and chart hits over years, although it was not Michel’s main objective to aim for chart hits when he founded Immaculate Music. The labels are primarily respected throughout the dance music and club scene and are musically considered to be leading record labels in the Netherlands. Artists featuring on Immaculate imprints include Secret Cinema, Literon, Coming Soon, Chord Symbols, Graylock, Sterac, Warren Fellow, M.I.R.K.O. and Grooveyard. The summer of 2004 has brought Michel and EC records a number 1 chart success in the Dutch Pepsi chart. The Fast Forward Anthem called “Be my guest“ was produced together with M.I.R.K.O. Again Michel produced the anthem for the 8th Dutch Love Parade. He has been ambassador for each edition and he has seen the Parade grow to one of the biggest parades worldwide \r\n\r\nFor his labels Michel has made several solo productions or releases in cooperation with Literon aka Gert-Jan Bijl, Secret cinema aka Grooveyard aka Jeroen Verheij and Mirko van Dommelen. Apart from his own labels Michel has also made music for Circle Records, Lilith Records, Artform, Lupp and Plink Plonk. \r\nSince a few years Michel also has HEY! records. On this label he only releases his own productions. The label has been supported by a whole range of dj’s from John Digweed, to Josh Wink, to Tom Middleton, to Adam Beyer. Furthermore he has had artists like Funk D ‘Void, Paul Klakbrenner, Polder, Mr G remixing tracks from the HEY! catalogue. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Michel is working on various compilation projects. The major ones are: the ‘Essential Elements’ series (EDM), the longest running Dutch dance compilation series since 1991, the ‘Technological Elements’ series (EDM), 'Impulz' (Influx), 'Dance Valley on Ibiza’ (Influx) and in-house compilation ‘Syntec’ (EC). Dance Valley Mainstage Edition, MDH01, 2 Faces. His latest cd offering “Recorded in Rotterdam” was highly appreciated and saw Michel supporting solely Dutch artists mixed on 1 cd. For the Amsterdam Dance Event of 2007 Michel produced ‘Recorded in Amsterdam’ where tracks from Rotterdam and Amsterdam based artists came together on one disc. And also his last mix cd, called No Nonsense, did it really well in Holland! \r\n\r\nNot only on clubs, parties and cd’s you can listen to Michel, he also has his radioshow called HEY-Muzik. It is now broadcasted nationwide every Friday from 21.00-23.00 on Fresh Fm. The show just earned the first price for best ‘dance radio show’ of Holland this year (2009!). \r\nIf you want to tune in for a weekly update on underground minimal, tekhouse, and techno music; www.fresh.fm \r\n\t\r\nBut above all Michel is playing all over the world, while maintaining his status as the number 1 underground tekhouse/techno dj from Holland. He has entertained thousands and thousands of people with his unique sound. From Space Ibiza, to Indonesia, from a 4000 people Rotterdam solo beach party to the Womb in Japan, from Circo Loco at DC 10 to Creamfields, the list is endless. And without a doubt the list will grow. \r\nIn 2009 Michel has already been touring in Japan, China, Hungary, UK, Greece, Spain etc. \r\nThe next thing is his own club night, called HEY! It just started but the future already looks really bright! At the end of June Michel will go to South America where he will perform in countries like Argentine, Colombia, Peru, Paraguay and Uruguay! And also with a Ibiza gig, a lot of festivals and his own area at the Mysteryland Festival the summer will be ‘quite’ cool! To be up to date with everything check www.micheldehey.com",

Introducing: Jeroen Hofer aka Melon. Not your average human being. Something that becomes obvious the second he enters the room – a beaming, larger than life personality that cannot possibly be ignored. Flair and charisma have never hurt anyone in this business.\r\n\r\nMelon is a natural artist, a DJ’s DJ who has managed to gain residencies and regular bookings at some of the world’s finest clubs purely by being great at spinning records, such as Fabric, Robert Johnson or Panorama Bar. His awesome record collection, spanning three decades of dance music, is the base for a unique sound that is always a few steps ahead of the game. Timeless, muscular house in all its glory and variety which can be witnessed at his monthly “Ratio?” residency at Trouw.\r\n\r\nOver the last few years, Melon has managed to create a high production profile. “Nitzi” on Innervisions and “Spring” on his own “Ratiomusic?” imprint are incredibly subtle and timeless masterpieces, while his work under his Je Dàvu moniker, such as his infamous re-edit of INXS’s “I Need You Tonight” and “I Zebra” on Platzhirsch, showcases a more rocking side of his repertoire.",

  "artist_bio": "Menno de Jong is primarily known as a Trance DJ and producer with an international following. Based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, de Jong was born on March 17, 1984 and was interested in music — classical as well as modern — at a young age.Being classically trained on the piano and incredibly passionate about music led to him taking up DJing and producing in his early teenage years. he first established himself as a producer with the release of ‘Guanxi’ on the British label Anjunabeats in 2004. In the years that followed he took the Trance scene by storm with singles such as “Tundra”, ‘Last Light Tonight’, ‘Spirit’, ‘Turtle Paradise’, ‘Never Lose The Magic’, ‘Place In The Sun’ featuring the vocals of Ellie Lawson and many more. This resulted in him being championed by the genre’s leading DJs including Tiësto, Armin van Buuren and Paul van Dyk. Numerous remixes for tracks such as ‘Mark Otten - So Serene’, ‘Karen Overton - Your Loving Arms’, ‘John O’Callaghan ft. Ria - I’ll Follow’ and the classic ‘Hydra - Affinity’ also proved popular within the Trance community.\r\n\r\nHe went on to perform at major clubs and festivals worldwide, including Tomorrowland, Electric Daisy Carnival, A State Of Trance, Amnesia Ibiza and Amsterdam Dance Event and over the years developed an unwitnessed agility in performing, equally talented in delivering prime time sets as well as marathons lasting as long as 10 hours.\r\n\r\nAfter working with a wide selection of leading labels Menno eventually signed with Black Hole Recordings in 2013, where he started releasing tracks on the legendary In Trance We Trust imprint. Arguably some of his biggest releases to date followed amongst which melodic masterpiece ‘Any Other Day’, the club anthem ‘Creatures Of The Night’ featuring Canadian vocalist Noire Lee, ‘Solicitude’ together with UK’s rising star Adam Ellis and more recently the Tech and Psy influenced ‘Abhyasa’.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this strain of successful releases Menno was asked to become A&R manager of In Trance We Trust, becoming the face of a label with one of the richest histories in the genre and providing a platform for future Trance stars alike.",

  "artist_bio": "..Maxime was born the sixteenth of february 1989. The little Island Curacao was the place that Influenced him from the start with rhythmic, Bachata, Merengue, Bolero and local Caribbean Reggae. At home his parents listened to soul and back in the days pop, rock music. At the age of 5 he moved to the Netherlands where he got in contact with a more classical view and melodic approach. Learning how to play the piano and having friends working with other instruments really gave insight in different aspects of \"genres\". While the years gained on him he focussed on collecting as much songs, records, tracks, as he could (afford). 90's Hip-Hop, Pop and House music were a major part of this. 17 years old he was when the first record players and mixer were brought into the house. in 2008 Maxime moved to Amsterdam where he got connected with people that had the same joy and open mind in experiencing easy going, jazzy, soulful, deeper, darker, faster dance music. Playing with vinyl, a necessity for the ultimate club feeling, got an addiction. The sound of intelligent electronica found in record stores and on the  world wide web seemed to be limitless.He felt he should learn as much about music in general as possible, Inspired by: Mozart, Stravinsky, Tchaikovsky, Chopin, Ravel, Sinatra, Jacques Brel, The Beatles, Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Giorgio Moroder, Yes, Mike Oldfield, Tangerine Dream, Depeche Mode, The Alan Parsons Project, Kraftwerk, Astrud Gilberto, Hans Zimmer, Queen, Pink Floyd, Carlos Santana, Walt Disney, Andre Rieu, Miles Davis, Roy Ayers, James Brown, Jimmy Hendrix, Stevie Wonder, St. Germain, Buena Vista Social Club, Bob Marley, UB40, Sade, The Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Frank Zappa, Sting, Phil Collins, Daft Punk, Madonna, Nirvana, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Nina Simone, Kool & The Gang, N.W.A, 2pac, A Tribe Called Quest,J Dilla, Enya, Brian Eno, Aphex Twin, Radiohead, Faithless, Eric Clapton, Ceasaria Evora, Manu Chao, Moloko, Thievery Corporation, Ron Hardy, Moodymann, Theo Parrish, Ron Trent, Mike Huckaby, Cajmere, Rick Wade, Kerri Chandler, Virgo Four, Robert Hood, Carl Craig, Moritz von Oswald, DJ Sneak, Armand van Helden, Matthew Herbert, Derrick Carter, Luciano, Ricardo Villalobos, Zip, Thomas Melchior, Baby Ford, Raresh, Petre Inspirescu, Rhadoo, Praslea, Barac, Cezar, SIT, Dan Andrei, Livio & Roby, Sascha Dive, Cobblestone Jazz, Richie Hawtin, Gaiser, 2000 and One, Isolee, Monolake, John Tejada, Audio Werner, Steve O' Sullivan, Inland Knights, Eddie Richards, Grant Dell, Mr.G, Josh Wink, Jerome Pacman, Cab Drivers, DJ Ali, Boo Williams, Anton Zap, Kevin Yost, Brothers Vibe, Guilame & The Countu Dumonts, Lauhaus, Boris Werner, Pascal Feos, Loco Dice, Robert Dietz, Nick Curly, Ray Okpara, Johnny D, Reboot, Zenker Brothers, Margaret Dygas, MCDE, Deadbeat, Agnes, Boards of Canada, Massive Attack, Incubus, Bonobo, Flying Lotus, Little Dragon, Tosca.

In the late 90′s he started as a DJ, soon he moved from turntables to his first equipment and started performing live-sets on various local party’s. While the underground scene was highly involved electro and techno music, Mike learned from it’s established dj’s & producers and how to work with analog equipment. As of this day, he still produces his tracks still without any computer sequencer. Mike Storm is most of all inspired by the sound from Detroit and minimal dark techno and his biggest passion is performing live on stage. In 2012 Mike’s coming out of the underground scene and sees his music is being appreciated by the likes of Jeff Mills and Dimi Angélis. Both DJ’s frequently use his tracks in their sets and it was Dimi Angélis who forwarded Mike to the label Subsist. The result is a debut album on the label Subsist.",

Not only as a DJ, but also as a producer and promoter he has been successful for more than a decade.Known for cracking jokes, his round figure, ever-fresh sneakers (of which he owns hundreds) and his everlasting smile Melly Mel is one of the most well-known figures in the Dutch DJ-scene. Not only as a DJ, but also as a producer and promoter he has been successful for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nLike most others of his time, he grew up with soul, disco, pop and hip-hop. His eye-opener came through nights at legendary clubs such as IT, Roxy and Paradiso. He soon realized his love for music had to be used for a greater good and the way to do this was to start DJ-ing. On the streets he was known to friends as either Mel or Melly (short for his name Melvin), which he combined to form the catchy DJ-name Melly Mel.\r\n\r\nMelly Mel first started DJ-ing in 1994 solo as well as part of the duo ‘Duo-Penotti’ and the style he chose to play was an all new style of music called house. While building up a name by spreading mixtapes, spinning in a number of clubs and making the right connections, he took his time to let his skills marinade, until four years later a new style of music called uk garage (which was already taking the UK scene by storm) was also beginning to claim souls in the Netherlands. Melly Mel was one of the first DJ’s to see the potential of this addictive sound and pioneered in representing the sound as a DJ as well as a promoter. He soon became one of the leading names in the Dutch uk garage scene and established his name in the scene.\r\n\r\nNowadays, years after the uk sound has blown over, he is back to spinning his first love: ‘house music’. Before the hype around this style he was already a pioneer introducing many new variations and sounds and making his house-sets eclectic (during the reign of the eclectic sound). It is undeniable that he helped form the hype that exists around house today, and next to this he is still one of the most sought-after house DJ’s around, mostly thanks to his originality and ability to be a trendsetting DJ.\r\n\r\nThe past few years have brought important changes to Melly Mel as an artist, as he started broadening his horizon by focusing more on his successes as a promoter. This resulted in a revival of the crème fresh parties and the great success of other parties such as Yakuza, BOSS, Addicts and Gratische. He also released a few mix-cd’s which can be heard all over the Netherlands. The past few years he has had a strong focus on music production, so that the crowd which he has entertained for more than a decade can share in his vision of music. Though his own label J.E.N. records he has released a number of records, including a collaboration track with Lady Bee which was released as a single in 2006.\r\n\r\nMore than a decade has passed since Melly Mel has made the decision to share his love for music with everyone who is ready to listen. He has affected and influenced many people to do the same thing, and has trained many starting DJ’s. For the next decade this talented DJ plans to break more boundaries and take his musical career to an even higher level: you’ve been warned!\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit Melly Mel’s official webpage at www.djmellymel.com",

Also known as his techno alter ego: 'NOAH', always had a big affection for music. His mom sang and always drawn much attention towards (playing) music.\r\nHe was baffled when he, as a 1½ year old baby, heard Michael Jackson on the television.\r\nHe didn't know how to walk yet, so he pulled himself on the TV-table, shaking his diapers and dancing on a Jackson track.\r\n\r\nHe played piano, jam be, drums and flute and started DJ-in when he was around the age of 15.\r\nHis eclectic taste for music caused his record stack to become very various. From old groove and house to uplifting techno and classics.\r\nIt was after a year that he decided to play for public as well, so he entered a contest, won and became resident after that.\r\n\r\nHis parents didn't like any of this, because they thought it would be affecting his school performances. He didn't let that get him in the way, so he climbed out his window at night to play his sets, regarding of what his parents thought of that.\r\nHe started giving events aswell.\r\nHe started a DJ-contest called; Evergreen. After a big success he started to work with Deep FM an online radio station mainly concerned on House & Dance music and has connections with the Defected label.\r\nHe created pre party's instead of afterparty's, events could go on for 16 hours straight.\r\n\r\nHe has been playing at venues like: Trouw, Studio 80, Club AIR, Woodstock, Flexbar, Supperclub, Odeon, Chicago Social Club, Onassis, Club Poema, Club Home, DOK 154, Winkel van Sinkel, Escape deLux, Jimmy Woo, Sugar Factory, Odeon, Zebra Lounge and a lot of other (illegal) venues and locations.\r\n\r\nNot only active in his home country, he also performed at Starbeach Village (Greece) and clubs & bars in Marbella.\r\nBecause Microove's style's been evolving over the years, he played with a lot of artists from different genres, like:\r\nKarotte, Jonas Kopp, Kenny Larkin, Ken Ishii, Lucy, Henning Baer, KRL, Heidi, tINI, Danny Daze, Dyed Soundorom, Frankie Knuckles, John Acquaviva, Roger Sanchez, Bob Sinclair, David Squillance, Kyle Hall, Soundstream, Chopstick & Johnjon and many others.\r\nBut also with Dutch artists, various like: Boris Werner, Lauhaus, Tom Ruijg, Don Diablo, Lucien Foort, Erick-E, De Sluwe Vos and many more.\r\n\r\nMicroove's a typical DJ that doesn't play for his public, but with his public. He always try's to feel the crowd, the club and the sound, so that he can play the perfect set considering those three elements.\r\nWhere his style was very eclectic in the beginning, now he tries to break the boundries between House and Techno using all his other music influences.\r\nAlmost all genres can have some kind of effect in his music, but not in an eclectic way. He's always sticking to that phat groove, pumping beats, acid sounds, snares and hi-hats. He creates grooves with loops of bass lines and other rides.\r\nSometimes the House overrules the Techno and sometimes it's the other way around. Not explained as Techhouse, but as he calls it: 'Housno'.\r\n\r\nIn the year 2008 he did the Electronic Music Production at the School for Audio Sound and Engineering in Amsterdam. Since that time he's been busy trying to perfect his sound.\r\nHe try's to keep his productions as diverse in genres as possible, showing that he is a diverse artist. Although he always gives it, that:",

'Maxito' is a Mexican way of saying \"little Max,\" which his parents loved to call him at an early age. 'Little' did they know Max would grow into the ironic nickname hitting a height of 6'7\" (2m). He studied recording arts at Ava Studios and SAE Institute and worked for a number of bands as Audio Engineer in the past. \r\n\r\nIt all started when he fell in love with vinyl. He started DJing with his friends in a small attic in Amsterdam exchanging records and organizing small parties together, During this time he developed a passion for Hip-Hop and other, more contemporary, slower speed styles (like Nu-Jazz and Indie R & B). After having played other people's music, he eventually wanted to play his own creations and from that moment on he has been producing music himself. He has always been inspired by House, Techno and Hip-Hop, being the foundation for his own music. However, in recent years, his interest in styles such as  Disco, Italo and Afrobeat has increased and  has now been integrated in his music as well. \r\n\r\nUnder his moniker Maxito he is still focussed towards a more ‘four to the floor’ vibe, In other words ‘Dubno’, which mixes elements of Techno, House and Dub, with releases on Dark energy Recording, Nightbird music and Razor N Tape as the other half of artist duo Grey Area. 'Maxito' stands for a mix of a lot of new music,  be it Hip-Hop, Disco, House or Techno.\r\n\r\n“Being able to channel your inspiration in various path’s or platforms, will hopefully create a understandable and fun experience for any listener. You should be able to expect nothing but the best I am capable of, in whatever genre.”",

  "artist_bio": "When hearing the likes of Mike Ravelli, don’t be fooled by his undeniable fresh sound, he’s by no means the new kid on the block! Ravelli is a musical ambassador in the Dutch underground House and Techno scene.He became a pioneering artist with the infamous Amsterdam based ‘GZG’ collective in the early 00's. During that time the Amsterdam’s clubbing scene was shocked by their wild parties and the thriving warehouse destinations and painted a new face to the electronic music industry during that period. Mike began his career in this wild, unpredictable atmosphere, where the crowds from different backgrounds came to party and made DJs think out of the box. Ravelli rose to the occasion, as he developed his versatile style and connection with his fellow partiers. From slow and melodic to fast-paced and energy-packed, his music meets the criteria craved by heated dance floors. \r\nNowadays, Mike Ravelli is recognized in the Netherlands for his borderless energetic sound in his DJ sets and has built a solid reputation as a popular act. Not only his highly acclaimed productions, supported by artists such as Karotte, Edu Imbernon and Dubfire, but also residencies at favorable Dutch techno and house organizations such as Shoeless, Perception, Thuishaven and the notorious Beachclub Woodstock 69 have lead him towards a career with international recognition. Mike Ravelli is all across the Netherlands, and is vastly taking on international performances and has played in clubs like Katerholzig Berlin, Egg London, Barraca Valencia, Lantern Beijing and of course Amsterdam Dance Event to name a few",

When the duo made their first tracks together they recognized that this foolish way of working was the best way to get to the top. Teamwork!\r\n\r\nTheir Partyjunkies EP got strong attention worldwide and went straight to the charts on all major digital music portals, including their popular dancehit ‘Amsterdam’ with the catchy lyrics that resemble the foolish life. Their sensational performances have already brought them to popular clubnights and venues like Rauw Amsterdam, Social Club Paris, parties for Vice Magazine, Club Woda Mexico, Voyeur San Diego, and Club Beta in Denver, the home of Beatport.\r\n\r\nIn the heat of the summer of 2009 they saw themselves performing on the biggest festivals in Holland like Dance Valley and Mystery Land. Not soon after that they flew to Australia for a huge club tour which was a big success and generated much fame on the other side of the world. Airplane in and out, the fools went to the USA for an another big club tour that took them to Hollywood to perform on the legendary Dim-Mak Tuesdays Night in Hollywood, LA. Beyond expectation, the crowd loved seeing the Mightyfools showing their enormous amount of energy.\r\n\r\nWhat to expect from these two superstars, you might wonder? That’s an easy question. Music that will set the dance floors on fire, crowd surfing party kids and having fun watching this hyperactive duo blend together their records as if it’s nothing. Possessing a gift to make dance floor hits, they remixed top class artists like: Crookers, Tommie Sunshine and even the world famous band Fall Out Boy, who wrote nothing but goodness about this new take on their song. With tracks appearing on Potty Mouth Music, Venga Digital, Ultra Records, Lektroluv and more, Mightyfools have also gained the attention of Laidback Luke, Kissy Sellout, Will Bailey, Bloody Beetroots, Diplo, Switch and fellow Potty Mouth Music labelmates, HiJack and Crookers. Their Kelis Milkshake remix continues generating dance floor buzz among house artists.\r\n\r\nThe Mightyfools sound is global gold: no matter where or when, they rock the floors. A mash up of party sounds inspired by house, disco, electro and a dose of rock 'n roll all led by their infamous basslines.\r\n\r\nNothing stands in the way. After a hectic 2009 that brought the Mightyfools all over the globe, constantly walking airplanes in and out, crowd surfing in every city they come, from Los Angeles to Sydney, Paris to Mexico City, 2010 promises nothing but worldwide success. With the party people just screaming for more, new tours are confirmed worldwide and brand new productions will soon be arriving on top-notch labels.\r\n\r\nMightyfools: full with hyperactive energy, are Mighty on the decks and Fools for the music!\r\n",

  "artist_bio": ". . . From funky and tribal techhouse/techno till driving & oldschool techno . . .As always the story starts somewhere. Martyro started playing techno in 2003, after he got captivated with this music in the beginning of this millenium. He has a history on energetic hardtechno. In time he favored the former Swedish and the more funky Italian 'Napoli'-techno. Nowadays he still plays driving and oldschool techno influenced by artists like Henrik B, Patrik Skoog, The Advent, Hardcell, Johan Bacto, Gaetano Parisio, Marco Carola, Adam Beyer, Chris Liebing, Eric Sneo and Dave Miller & Damian Keane to name a few. \r\n\r\nBesides his side of driving and oldschool techno he loves to play funky and tribal 'Napoli' techno even more. Post millenium techno got him strongly influenced with the sounds from artists like Ben Sims, Cristian Varela, Eric Sneo, Joey Beltram, Technasia, Secret Cinema, DJ Link, A.Paul, Mark Broom, Samuel L Session, Spiros Kaloumenos and Invite till this day, as well as the former sounds of Marco Carola, Rino Cerrone, Danilo Vigorito, Gaetano Parisio, Deetron, Kobaya, Marko Nastic, Umek, Valentino Kanzyani, Remy, Preach and Hertz to name a few of his (past) favorites. \r\n\r\nMartyro always keeps in mind that techno music is desired to be very danceable; expect driving loops, funky elements and climaxing breaks. Yet coherency is one of the key aspects present in his sets at all times. Still preferably playing vinyl at this moment and using persistent forward mixing and subtle efx he progressively advances his sets to achieve higher levels. Martyro always adjusts and builds up his sets taking into account the time and type of the night.\r\n\r\n\r\nInfluences /\r\n\r\nBen Sims, Mark Broom, Paul Mac, Mark Williams, Remy, Marco Carola, Rino Cerrone, Danilo Vigorito, Gaetano Parisio, Cristian Varela, Eric Sneo, Joey Beltram, The Advent, Steve Rachmad, Secret Cinema, Technasia, Joris Voorn, Adam Beyer, Henrik B, Hardcell, James Ruskin, Surgeon, Regis, Chris Liebing, Speedy J, Marko Nastic, Umek, Valentino Kanzyani, A.Paul, DJ Link, Samuel L Session, Spiros Kaloumenos, Axel Karakasis, Invite\r\nUnderground Resistance, Robert Hood, DJ Bone, Rolando, Stacey Pullen\r\nLaurent Garnier, Underworld, Faithless, Moby, The Prodigy, Aphex Twin, Daft Punk, Orbital, Autechre, Fluke",

  "artist_bio": "To simply describe Mike Risk: a pioneer in the ever-evolving dance music world, still influencing many with ground-breaking DJ sets and parties, touching souls and making them dance! \r\n\r\nTraveling the world and working closely with some of the world’s greatest DJ’s, inspired and influenced his very unique and distinguished skillset and style of DJ-ing. Respected by many, he keeps on impressing with his impeccable DJ skills: deep, energetic, both uplifting as dark and irresistible to dance to. Delivering a seamless mix of upfront New York Garage, Chicago House, Detroit Techno, deep house, disco and whatever feels right.At the age of 18 Mike Risk moved to Amsterdam where he got hooked on house music. In 1994 he started DJ-ing and throwing parties; ‘Club Risk’ was a fact. It became a house and techno institute and breeding ground for talent, bringing countless international household names to Holland. It led to around 140 nationwide Club Risk parties a year. Following one of Holland’s first DJ agencies came to life: ‘Risk Agency’. Acclaimed DJ’s like Roog (Hardsoul), Leroy Rey and childhood friend Eric de Man jumpstarted their long-lasting careers here. Big international names such as Masters at Work (Kenny Dope & Louie Vega), Kerri Chandler, Jazzy Jeff, Dennis Ferrer, DJ Spen, Joey Negro and many more also joined the agency. These and many other endeavours have made him very influential in (Dutch) dance music in the last 20 years. This also lead Chicago house legend Lil’ Louis to include Mike Risk as one of the 100 most influential people in his documentary about house music history.\r\n\r\n2006 was a year of change and new adventures. Club Risk and Risk Agency ended, where RiskSoundSystem (RSS) and FUSE were born. FUSE is a leading Dutch PR/Marketing agency, where he is a successful creative director and co-founder. RSS was a house music collective with likeminded friends (Leroy Rey, Chocolate Brown, John Agesilas) and would shortly grow to a principal act in Dutch ‘real house music’ scene. After the collective’s break up Mike Risk continued his musical quest as a solo artist.\r\n\r\nMike Risk has played at various famous festivals, like Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE), IPM Rome, WMC Miami, Valtifest, Bungalup, O.W.A.P., Pacha Festival, Boothstock Festival, Loveland Festival, Dance Valley and Milkshake Festival to name a few. And several outstanding clubs around the globe like Cielo (New York), The Vanguard (LA), The Vagabond (Miami), El Divino (Ibiza), Ocean Beach (Ibiza), Room26 (Rome), DJOON (Paris), Pulse (London), HU’U Bar (Bali) and numerous clubs Dutch clubs like Paradiso, Gashouder, Melkweg, Jimmy Woo, AIR, Sugarfactory, Supperclub and many more to come.",

  "artist_bio": "It has been 10 years since MC Spyder made his first appearance in Holland, he was one of the people to introduce the U.K garage sound in The Netherlands. He started out on local pirate radio stations in the U.K and small parties and clubs until he joined with DJ Timmy Boomkat.\r\n\r\nSince 1997 MC Spyder has been in demand on the Dutch scene, and so he settled in Amsterdam. Groovemaster Johnson's Bubbleclub started in 1998, which was no doubt one of the most popular nights in Amsterdam in those glory days. His voice could also be heard every Sunday night in the legendary RoXY. He worked for Speedfreax, Dancevalley, Drumm Rythm Festival, The City is Ours, Mysteryland, Rotterdam Dance Parade ,and many more.\r\n\r\nGermany and Spain also discovered refreshing sound. He became all round and did variou..Mc Spyder started out in the UK playing a variety of clubs, parties and bars, pushing his unique voice and sound with his team of creators such as DJ Timmy Boomkat, MJ Cole and many other producers of the modern sound we all know today. As one of the people to introduce XXX to the UK garage sound, he has evolved as the times changed continuing to push his limits, offering the next level of what he has been exposed to in his wide spread travels. Spyder has been a fixture of the Amsterdam music scene for over 1o years. Working Groovemaster Johnsons party “Bubbleclub” in 98 as well as being a resident of the legendary RoXY. He was the host/MC of parties like SpeedFreax, Dancevalley, Latin Village, Extrema, Drumm Rhythm Festival, The City Is Ours, MysterLand, The Rotterdam Dance Parade and many more unique gigs along the way. More recently he has been working on the UK Funky and Shake Up Projects in venues all around Holland such as Escape, Rex, Manhattan, Club Noa as well as many other pop up gigs to keep things fresh. You can catch Spyder DJ'ing all around the EU under the name Vinyl Cru (www.vinylcru.nl) or under his real name Simon Titus. Never being one to be tied down to one spot, Spyder is always traveling and promoting the scene and music he loves so much, as well as pushing his limits by working in Television and Radio. Spyder is the feature voice over for the Suzuki Swift Ad campaign (06-10). As well as collaborating with top industry professionals on his own sound leading to his joining of the group “Spark”. The first single they dropped, “I Dream Of You Baby” was a huge success in the UK and Netherlands dance scenes, finding its way in to almost every DJ’s bag of tricks for some time. Spyder came back in 05 working with Olav Basoski on a track called “Waterman”, this appropriate title echoed the flood gate of success the track would go on to achieving. Eventually ending up with the coveted Gold Record staus in the EU, released in over 25 countries and toping the dance charts in many hotspots around the world. Following up the success of WaterMan, Olav and Spyder hit off “Like dis” featuring a remix by Freddie Le Grand. Hitting the decks in 06 it found a strong hold on many DJ’s ears and was another strong showing of the unique vibe Spyder flows with.

His work is featured on 170 different CDs, LPs and cassettes, and he even has two entries in the Guiness Book of Hit Records.He is best known for his 1992 European hitsingle 'Poing', which is amongst the best selling house classics of all time. Maurice also produced tracks as and with Armageddon, Sperminator, Wicked on Wax, Evil Maniax and made several remixes for artists like Ruffneck, Human Resource, Lenny Dee and Paul Elstak. Back in those days he played at numerous big parties, like Nightmare In Rotterdam and Megarave and had international bookings in countries like England, Spain, Scotland, Switzerland and the USA.\r\n\r\nAfter the rebirth of Hardcore, Maurice toured with T99 (Anasthasia) and Human Resource (known for their dance classic \"Dominator\") through Europe and America. During this tour they even headlined at HouseQlassics in Amsterdam in September of 2004. After the success of this tour he picked up DJ'ing once again, which resulted in great performances at parties like 15 Years Of Nightmare, Rotterdam Records 15th anniversary and the Parkzicht Reunion. Recently he also mixed the oldschool and early Hardcore cd for the Rotterdam Records 15+1 Years compilation, which was very well received. His DJ sets are filled with the best Oldschool and Hardcore classics available, only playing records from before 1998 and making you really take a trip down memory lane.",

These parties, chiefly arranged by DJ RaveRunner are still highly appreciated by a large crowd.  Being one of the most wanted DJ's at these parties, DJ Mogwai has shown his worth to his fans, which resulted in a residential occupation in  Discotheque Peppermill in Heerlen where he became resident every Friday, among his proud team-mate DJ RaveRunner. This period became the most important learning period for DJ Mogwai, regarding the meaning of mixing. The 2 years of being resident in Peppermill  opened many doors for him for the future. Among these opportunities are a one year resident occupation in Discotheque Lazzurra in Maaseik (Belgium), and his very own radio show Groovemasters @ Falcon Radio. This period brought DJ Mogwai to a higher level representing his so called unique and OWN CREATED SOUND, which took him to the 'next stage':  the International Grounds, where DJ Mogwai's bookings are requested all over Europe. Because of his wide scaled combination of sounds, DJ Mogwai made himself compatible to fit in many different  atmospheres, which makes it very easy for him, to satisfy the needs of all kinds of crowds. DJ Mogwai created this atmosphere by combining styles from '2-step to Club' and from Electro to Tek-House'. Above all, DJ Mogwai is always equipped with the latest releases, to be well prepared and 100% up to date. This way, DJ Mogwai is able to fascinate his audience continuously, without being forced to fall back to old styles. For now and on to the future, DJ Mogwai is becoming a well respected DJ across Europe, strongly intending to expand this respect worldwide.......",

  "artist_bio": "JK aka Monotron fell in love with electronic music at the age of 13. This happened when his cousin took him to his first Drum and Bass party. Jeroen was quickly blown away by the crazy vibe, people and most of all: the music. Several years passed and Jeroen has grown into a true fanatic. A couple of years later, at the age of 17 he was dragged to a “Minimal/Techno” party by friends. At this age he was sure of the fact that he would never be able to like this genre, but he decided to tag along anyway. “I saw the light”, Monotron says smiling, “and from that day I became Minimal.”.....\r\nJeroen aka Monotron fell in love with electronic music at the age of 13.

It makes me so happy! Being creative has changed my life; it gives me fulfillment and I’m truly dedicated to music.” \r\n\r\nOn beatport his tracks hit the top 50 in the minimal and electronica charts.\r\nHis solo release Different Faces EP on THEMA Recordings New York (With earlier releases of Ion Ludwig, Mikael Stravostrand, Jorge Savoretti, Cesare vs Disorder and many more) is a great start of his career. \r\n\r\n",

With her eclectic taste in music, ranging from energetic grooves with plenty of vocals to a deeper, progressive sound, Miss Nine turns heads and moves feet wherever she performs.\r\n\r\nAmsterdam\r\nMiss Nine was born in Germany as Kristin Schrot and at the age of 16, she started her career – not as a DJ, but as a model. Shortly thereafter, she secured a worldwide contract with Elite Model Management. After moving to Amsterdam, she discovered the art of DJ’ing and her passion for music eventually led her become a DJ as well.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, only a few months after touching the decks for the first time, she be- came a resident DJ at the legendary Motion parties where she evolved as an artist and DJ while playing alongside masters such as John Digweed, Dave Seaman, Nick Warren, and James Zabiela. 2003 was also the year that Miss Nine took to the decks as the youngest artist at the 10th edition of Dance Valley (renowned Dutch Dance Festival). At the end of 2005, Miss Nine was then asked by Grammy Award winning DJ duo, Deep Dish to join Bullitt Bookings, the reputable agency of A-list DJs. This allowed Miss Nine to enter the forefront of the international DJ scene for the first time.\r\n\r\n925 Digital\r\nIn 2008, Miss Nine started her own record label called 925 Digital. Having spent so much time in the dance scene, she realized that there were too many excellent progressive-house tracks that didn’t get the release and the attention that they deserved. 925 Digital was created in order to ensure that this didn’t happen and bring progressive house, and the artists behind it, to prominence. Miss Nine performs all around the globe, spinning at clubs such as Privilege in Ibiza, Avalon in Los Angeles, Warung in Brazil, the Ministry of Sound in London and\r\nseveral Pacha’s around the world. She has also graced the main stage of the Ultra Music Festival in Miami, joining a line-up of, among others, Tiësto and David Guetta.\r\n\r\nDiscography\r\nMiss Nine was the first female DJ to mix a compilation for Washington-based Yoshitoshi Recordings, the world-renowned leader in progressive and big-room house music. The highly anticipated Yoshitoshi Ibiza: Mixed by Miss Nine (YRCDLP15) was released in September 2006 and made it to the number 1 spot on iTunes in the United States. In June of 2008 Miss Nine also released an album on the world famous Armada label: Dancefloor Sessions (ARMA134). Her latest release was in 2010: Fantasia, which is available for purchase in Asia.\r\n\r\nNine Sessions\r\nNine Sessions is Miss Nine’s monthly radio show which is broadcasted in more than 35 countries, including DI.fm, Proton, Frisky and Dance Paradise. Since January 2011, Nine Sessions is also available as a podcast on iTunes. During this one-hour show, Miss Nine shares her favorite tracks of the moment with her listeners.\r\n\r\nCampaigns\r\nIn 2010, Miss Nine became the ambassador of the revolutionary Levi’s® Curve ID line. To draw even more attention to this new line, she mixed the compilation album Levi’s® Curve ID. In addition to spinning at numerous events, which are actively being promoted in Europe and Asia, Miss Nine also hosted Levi’s® presents Miss Nine in the supperclub during the Amsterdam Dance Event in October of 2010.\r\nMiss Nine is also now the face of Pioneer for their new Pioneer 350 series, turntables that are meant for amateur DJs. As part of a European-wide promotional campaign, video clips in which Miss Nine is demonstrating these turntables are being televised on MTV.\r\n\r\nShe will be touring worldwide in 2011, so make sure to check www.miss-nine.com and catch the queen of the decks at a venue near you!",

Not only an excellent deejay, she is also the founder of Djax records, a label every real techno, acid, or dance freak in general should have heard off. Releasing constantly new underground music, Djax has built a reputation that stands solid as a rock and has placed Eindhoven (Acidhoven) on the world's electronic music map.\r\n\r\nDjax (and its variety of sub-labels) must undoubtedly be considered as one of the most important dance labels in the world. At the back of the book '1989 - 1999 Djax Records The Power of the Underground' James Hymann, (MTV Europe) calls it 'one of the decade's crucial labels' and further 'one of the world's most talked about labels'. People like Felix da Housecat, Justin Berkovi, Claude Young, Luke Slater, DJ Rush and off course Miss Djax herself have released tracks on Djax. No surprise then, Djax received many awards being best record label.\r\n\r\n\t\r\nBeside running her very succesful label, Saskia is, as mentioned, also a\r\nvery popular international deejay. For many years she somewhere appeared on a list of 'international dj of the year', allways top ten, allways accompanied by people like Jeff Mills, Richie Hawtin, Laurent Garnier, Carl Cox and so on. She has played all over the world and on all major events worldwide. A few examples? She closed two times at the Victory Tower at the Love Parade, she also played four times at the Love Nation party on the Love Parade, six times at Mayday, four times at Nature One, I Love Techno, Innercity and so on.",

In 1992 Misja started to buy the records he liked, and his choice was Trance (Progressive House).\r\n\r\nAfter trying hard at home and buying more records he started to play at parties he organised together with a friend in Rotterdam. In the mean time he met DJ Tiësto, who was already a well known DJ in Holland, and he gave Misja the chance to mix his own CD. \"In Trance We Trust 001\" which was released in September 1998 on Black Hole Recordings. This CD was well sold in The Netherlands, Israel and Norway, which resulted in many dj bookings in these countries.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Misja’s name was getting bigger in Scandinavia, and so did the venues he played at. In October 1999 in Denmark and April 2001 in Norway he played on Hyperstate (Innercity of Scandinavia).\r\n\r\nBecause of his success he was asked in August 2000 to do the number 10 of the succesfull CD compilation Forbidden Paradise.

Mononoid is all about connecting art and music evolving into their own unique sound. Their music is a mixture of cinematographic and melodic techno.\r\n\r\nAndy and Igor started a techhouse production duo in 2006, called Stereo Sandwich, in which they had their first experience producing dance music with each other. After releasing several EP’s, they soon noticed their sound was evolving. They started experimenting with deeper, more profound productions and realized this new sound had grown too far apart from what they were doing before; this was a whole new project altogether. They took the word ‘Mono’ (as in solo) and the word ‘nooit’ (Dutch for never), basically meaning ‘never alone’ and Mononoid was born.\r\n\r\nIn 2011 their music was picked up by Traum Schallplatten, offering them a place in the Traum Family. Soon after they released their first remix for Microtrauma’s “Emilia”, which got great feedback. Their remix of “Echoes Reality” is nothing less than a trip, with a deep grove and great chorus. In May of 2012 their first own EP was released on Traum, ‘Protoplasm’ which has been received brilliantly. In September of 2012 their second release ‘Concept Of Cures’ was released. The EP stormed the Techno releases charts soon after, resulting in a solid top 10 position on Beatport.",

Intrigued by these innovative sounds from Chicago and Detroit, he became aware of a profound passion for electronic dance music. Ten years later, Milan’s entire life revolves around DJ’ing and event organisation.\r\n \r\nIn 2006 Milan enrolled to study at the Academy for Popular Culture, preparing himself for a professional music career and creating the foundation for an interesting future. Shortly after, he founded the event organization “Eye Nexus” and provided the city of Groningen with an innovative event platform for creative students, graduates and artists from the northern provences of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nDuring the following years, Eye Nexus launched the “Our World” event (a social fundsraiser held aboard a renovated cargo vessel), and the “BeatsBall Festival” at the Groningen City Beach. With two succesful event concepts, Milan’s profile grew and a monthly residency at Groningen’s house temple Pand48 was established. There he met like-minded organisers and DJ’s which led to the co-production of the club event called “Boel op Stelten”, and a monthly residency.\r\n\r\nEarly 2011, Milan launched the Origins event project, intending to create a true rave in a converted warehouse. With a thousand people raising their hands, this event proved to be the kick-start for his career, shortly followed by an internship at the infamous Studio 80 in Amsterdam. There he was given the opportunity to organise and become the resident DJ of the new wednesday club concept called Black Box, focussing on the new international house sound. Studio 80, with it’s colourful and creative visitors, was the ideal venue to present this new music direction.\r\n\r\nAs the years passed, his sound became more refined and grew into a blend of deephouse and subb-driven grooves. He gained experience playing at a wide variety of venues, often praised for his warm opening sets, setting the mood. One might say that Milan is truly part of the new generation of artists living for the beauty of music and the purity of the dancefloor, always searching to improve the scene and stay innovative in both sound and organisation.\r\n",

This collaboration has led to resident nights at Club 11, Amsterdam, Petrol in Antwerp, Plan-2 in Eindhoven and Rotown in Rotterdam, and their music productions with a first release called: 'Bootsjunge' on the 10daysoff vinyl compilation (Play out!)\r\n\r\n'Estafête' is the name for a new collaboration between dj/producer Estroe, Dj/producer Dj Lin and Monica Electronica. More info soon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For, as the past few decades have shown, when it comes to dance music, the world follows Holland’s lead. And right now, no new star shines as bright as our own Miss Melera.\r\n\r\nFor the past decade, the Amsterdam-based Miss Melera has been perfecting her art, and developing mixing skills that have already been compared to legends such as Sasha and John Digweed. She’s done her homework, absorbing the essence behind traditional genres such as progressive, deep and tech house and old-school techno, and then twisting them into a melodic confection that is both fresh and timeless, and completely her own.\r\n\r\nA triple threat, Miss Melera is as at home in the studio as she is on the airwaves, in the DJ booth at an underground club, or on the stage of an outdoor massive. In the past year, she has played increasingly high profile dates in India, the Americas, including Canada, the US, and Columbia, and, of course, Berlin. Her monthly radio show on soundcloud, Colourizon, is increasingly popular, and her fast-growing fan base is embrasing her second release, Faith.\r\n\r\nFaith, which follows last year’s Stare/Stunning, is a three-song EP including the title track, “Fearless,” and an Einmusik remix of “Faith.” As Miss Melera has always regarded Einmusik as a great inspiration, she is particularly honored to be able to include it on the release, and do so on Einmusika Recordings.\r\n\r\nThis record, which Thump calls “dark tech house at its finest,” and her upcoming tour will give a global audience a chance to experience what savvy music lovers in Miami, Berlin, and Amsterdam already have. As they will tell you, when you’re under Miss Melera’s spell, you won’t stop moving.\r\n\r\nConsider yourself warned.\r\n\r\nWebsites:\r\n\r\nwww.missmelera.com \r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/missmelera \r\n\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/missmelera\r\n\r\n\r\nText: Neil Fineman",

It’s no technical talk when Mispoes explains the way she controls the decks. It’s all about feeling the audience rather than to overthink what you’re doing. Led by the emotion that is the music and driven by the positive vibes from the dancefloor she blows her crowd away in a positive, energetic and joyful set. With a resumé consisting of clubs and parties such as TWSTD, ADE, Club Home, Stalker, Doornroosje, Lazy Sundays, Amsterdam Open Air,  Krak, Chateau Techno and Hoog Water. Mispoes is the perfect addition to your sunny day festival and will have your guests jumping, grooving and smiling as long as your timetable will let her.",

What set him apart from his friends awas his conviction to share his passion for music with the world around him. This was why he started a drive-in show while he was still in his teens.

He grew up listening to music almost without pause, whether on his walkman, diskman or minidisc there was always some form of music in his ear to accompany him on his journey through life. What set him apart from his friends awas his conviction to share his passion for music with the world around him. This was why he started a drive-in show while he was still in his teens. To quote Mind 01 on his vision of music: ”Music is the cure, that makes you forget all that is negative.” \r\nHe had his transition to minimal techno one summer in Barcelona. For Mind 01 that summer meant his definite taste switch to techno. When he came home in Amsterdam he realised he was bitten. Bitten by the beatbug. And he still feels that bite everyday when he stands behind his mixer. As a DJ today, he plays with the same purpose with which he performed his drive in show; Mind 01 uses his music to entertain. To prove his skills he entered the Dommelsch DJ contest a year ago, and easily made it to the finals, showing he can compete with the best DJ’s Amsterdam has to offer.\r\nMind 01 follows his instincts and the reactions of the crowd to decide the style of every set he plays. You will find that he never plays the same set or mix twice, always striving to maximize the amusement value for his audience. And he’s not afraid to take a gamble, to try something while performing, something he unprepared. He can mix a soulfull set, or turn up the tempo and blow up the venue. Whatever his audiences desire, Mind 01 will deliver with his own twist. Sometimes that even means breaking a set with an unexpected, short burst of chaos, using his effects and loops, to subtly regain control and climax spectacularly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "mps PILOT is one of The Netherlands' most experienced and renowned Tropical/Worldbass DJ's. His work promises state of the art mixing of contemporary worldwide produced dance music. The BPM in his set vary inbetween 80-180 and the tracks come from Africa, Asia, Latin America, Brasil, North America, The Middle East and Europe. His performances virtually took him all over the world, spinning both in desert areas and metropolises. Catch him spinning at his residency in Amsterdam: Wild Unlimited. mps PILOT is host of the Amsterdam Tropical page on 22Tracks.comIntroduction. mps PILOT has traveled extensively through a.o. the Balkans, Spain, India, Turkey, Morocco, Senegal, Mali and Burkina Faso and has immersed himself in the cutting-edge world music scene, a musical universe where exciting developments can be heard every day. In every possible direction and slippage between all different genres, mps PILOT maps the crosspollination and divergence of contemporary music. His interest in non-western music started during his time at university. Because of his interest in modern classical and experimental music he moved in 1990 to Amsterdam to enroll in the musicology department. Within the subject of ethnomusicology, however he continued to explore his fascination through sounds from all over the world. However, after seven years of studying it was time for the real thing. \r\n\r\nFacts. mps PILOT’s refined yet hip mix of non-western music is nowadays appreciated way beyond Amsterdam. Since 2003 he is resident at the Sfinks Festival, Belgium. Besides the famous Amsterdam clubs like Paradiso and De Melkweg, mps PILOT is resident DJ at Ethnic Histeric, @ The Sugarfactory Amsterdam and @ Club Rasa, Rasa, Utrecht. For several years he had residencies @ Que Pasa, De Melkweg, Club Mundial, 013/Tilburg, the Global Nights in the artists’ enclave Ruigoord and Mystic Grooves, Utrecht/Amsterdam. He spins regularly for the Dutch/Maghreb organisation Marmoucha and in the Netherlands many times at festivals such as The Music Meeting, Dunya, Festival Mundial, Amsterdam Roots, Oerol, The Amsterdam Dance Event, Mysteryland, Dancevalley, 5 Days Off, The Contrabanda Festival and Lowlands. His overseas DJ trips in 2003, 2004 and 2008 brought him to Le Festival au Désert in Essakane, Mali. In 2004 mps PILOT deejayed WOMEX. In 2005 he performed during the Jaipur Festival in Rajasthan and in Bombay, India. In 2005 he stirred up 10,000 people during the Rawafid Festival in Casablanca and in 2006 & 2008 a crowd of 50,000 at the Timitar Festival in Agadir, Marokko. 2007 saw the The Sziget Festival, North Sea Jazz & Sfinks. January 2008 DJ mps PILOT traveled one month in Mali also to play for the 3rd time @ Le Festival au Désert. In 2009 it was Spain's turn with performances in Barcelona and Fuerteventura and a winter performance in Istanbul, 2010 resulted in a stunning performance at the Afro Latino Festival (B) and again at North Sea Jazz. It was was the period when mps PILOT founded Future Takamba. FUTURE TAKAMBA is a crossover project of Malian Takamba and Dutch electronic dance and trance music, enriched with VJ / visuals. A convergence of auditory and visual experiment from the Sahara and Amsterdam. mps Pilot was in 2003 at the Festival au Desert in Mali and was captured by the traditional music of the band Super 11which has been there 30 years long term. Their repetitive deep, rootsy music consists of riffs on ngoni's (plucked lute), on vocals and percussion gourds and comes from the oral transmission of tales of nomads from the southern Sahara. Takamba music takes you literally, says Horst Timmers. \"I play my electronic music live while the VJ Lotte Man creates an extra dimension with her ​​visuals. Then there are the graceful dancers from the Super 11 group. This creates an intense and modern takamba experience that detachment from the ground. \"performances followed this year in Belgium and the Netherlands. They performed touring in The Netherlands and Belgium, and at the the Festival au Niger, Segou and the Jazzy Ben Koum Festival in Bamako, Mali. 2011 is also the first year of his residency at Shuffle.Play in De Melkweg, Amsterdam, \r\n\r\nStyle. With an expressive and convincing execution, mps PILOT is able to let traditional and modern styles from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America flow through each other, forming a contagious sound. While many world music deejays have never heard of ‘beatmatching’, even perceiving it as deadly for the future of music, mps PILOT elevates ‘beatmatching’ to a high form of art. He weaves drum n’ bass rhythms, flamenco palmas, Indian bhangra-or Desi beats and Latin percussion solos into an organic whole. Using a rhythmic, intelligent mix technique, mps PILOT’s music functions as a mindopener.\r\n\r\nmps PILOT performed alongside artists such as the Tarafs de Haidouks (tour), Shantel, Natacha Atlas, Salif Keita, Tinariwen, Ojos De Brujo, Zuco103, Habib Koite, Mercan Dede, Yuri Buenaventura, Konono No.1, Sekouba Bambino, Mory Kante and many more. He joined several times stage with Shantel, The Future World Funk Dj’s, Bobby & Nihal, the Mr Bongo DJ’s, DJ Panko, DJ Dolores and DJ Ipek.",

Running monthly modular synth events here in Rotterdam and doing live sets all over the world.I started expoloring/buying synthesizers around 1994. It was a Crumar Bit One synthesizer and later on i added a Korg Mono/Poly and Roland JX3P. After that things came and went, and the setup changed over and over. At some point I realized I loved moving knobs and programming more than playing with those white and black things on my synthesizers. Soon i bought my first modular synthesizer, an ARP 2600 and that started a never ending story.\r\nAt some point in 2007 I went to an Electro-Music.com event in Belgium called “Chateau Sonore” And I met a guy who programmed self playing patch noodles on the Clavia G2 modular. It fascinated me and I became really passionate about self generating patches that play stuff without any human or computer manipulation at all.\r\nNowadays i'm running a modular event in the Netherlands called \"Noodlebar\" This is the spot to play modular synthesizers and we have artists from all over the world coming over.\r\nI've done a lecture at the Dutch Film Festival about modular synthesis and collecting stuff. Played at festivals like Freerotation and did stuff for Intergalactic fm. I have releases on Doppelganger records, Strange Life Records and more...\r\nI've gigged in various places like Amsterdam, Brussels, Berlin, Oxford, Manchester, Copenhagen, Estonia, Myanmar, and Chengdu.",

  "artist_bio": "Mr. Jones, Dutch producer, releasing on DSNT, The Public Stand. Also half of production duo _Unsubscribe_ with Dave Clarke.Haarlem, mid 2010, Mr. Jones (Jonas Uittenbosch, 1981, Amsterdam) sits in his project studio wrapping up yet another track. He reflects on his work over the past few years, and knows, knows it's time to get out there. He has committed himself for years to develop his own sound, his own methodology in the studio and his own artistic view on techno before stepping out. Mr. Jones proves that confidence, dedication and patience pay off in the end.\r\n\r\n\"You just cannot simply develop your own sound in a few months, it cannot be done, because at first, after getting the hang of the technique you will sounds like anyone else. And that's just not the point of techno, at least not the challenging techno I've always loved\", Jones says.\r\n\r\nHe decides to attend Amsterdam Dance Event's infamous Demolition Panel where he gets instantly noticed by Dave Clarke who then gives Jones his first airplay on his infamous Whitenoise Radio Show, underlining Jones' gut feeling the time was right to get out there.For six months straight, after his first airplay, Jones provides Whitenoise Radio with a brand new track every week that makes into the airwaves, making him the techno artist with most airplay on Dutch National Radio at the time while still being unsigned. There's even a small buzz going on the twitter, saying that Mr. Jones is an alias of Dave Clarke himself (who hasnt made music in seven years at that point). But that is not the case, it's all this one kid from Haarlem.\r\n\r\nOff course, now the labels come running for Jones. He starts to release on The Public Stand, HeavyReel, Afro Acid and artists like BLACKASTEROID, Audio Injection and Ben Sims want to remix his music. But end of 2011 it gets a little quiet, his soundcloud account is quiet for weeks, which disturbs his followers on social media, people don't get they're weekly dose of a new Mr. Jones track on the radio anymore.\r\n\r\nIt turns out Dave Clarke is responsible for that, he invited Mr. Jones to come down to his new studio in Amsterdam. The Baron and Jones bond easily and the two form a new production unit \"Unsubscribe\". It's a remix project at first, reworking music from BLACKASTEROID, Detroit's Octave One, Marcel Fengler, Phil Kieran, Boys Noize, the legendary John Foxx (Ultravox)  and many more. Dave Clarke even states in the press that Jones brought him back the joy of being the studio again. Their first original single was done soon after, called Spek Hondje (featuring Chicago MC Bear Who), released on Fabric London's offspring label Houndstooth.\r\nThe festival and club programmers take notice as well and Jones earns himself spots at Awakenings Festival, Mysteryland, Fabrik, Perron, Napoli and secured his spot at The Melkweg as well during ADE at \"Dave Clarke Presents\".\r\n\r\nEven Holland's biggest selling hip hop act \"De Jeugd Van Tegenwoordig\", (who are known to attend the occasional techno event) ask Jones to remix the first single of their new album \"De Formule\". They give him four days to do it. Jones doesn't crack under pressure and delivers, again.",

In 2004, after using various mixing software, he started as a DJ mainly playing Electro, House and Tech-house in different clubs national and international like Spain, France and Malaysia.\r\n\r\nStijn van Oorschot had his first musical awakening in 1996. Having played the drums for several years, being in different bands and getting experience with different styles of music, he first came in touch with the dance scene in 2002. In search of his musical preference he tried out various instruments, drumcomputers and programs all leaning towards the electronical music.\r\nAfter they both came back from their foreign trips they thought it was time for a change. They began a partnership, both sharing the same passion, skill-set and ambition for electronical music. Inspired by different names in the Techno scene as well as various influences from, House, Progressive, Electro, Pop, Rock and Hip-Hop they rapidly developed their own style and musical taste.\r\n\r\nAfter gaining more experience and musical know-how over the last few years, Minilab started working on their own productions. In their own tracks they try to make a mixture of different styles and influences. They produce a sound that’s recognizable and reflects the same energy and passion that Minilab wants to project.\r\n\r\nWorking both as producer and DJ gives them a good insight of what the people wan to hear nowadays. Having played in bars, clubs and festivals through-out the Netherlands and having shared the DJ booth with many well known DJs like, Michel de Hey, Secret Cinema, Bart Skils, Noisia, Warren Fellow, Invite and Spark Taberner, they fluently process these experiences into their own productions. After having done different Remixes for local DJs like Solid Decay, Jack Wax and Invite they now have some upcoming releases on XT3 Recordings and Flatlife Records.\r\n\r\nTheir work behind the decks when playing in front of the crowd is literally back to back. With multiple decks and a set that takes you on a journey from the beginning till the end, they are on a mission to give each and everyone a heck of time.",

  "artist_bio": "DJ Miss Wendy from Holland. Her musicstyle has finetuned into a variety of club-electro, tribal with techno-trance influences.Miss Wendy has been active as a dj since 1994. As she experienced the beginning of the housescene in Holland, she got inspired to play her own music. So it didn’t take long before she had her own turntables and her own records. From there on it was just a matter of time to dj at her first party. \r\n\r\nAfter she got her residencies in the hot clubscene of Amsterdam (\"Dino’s\", \"Escape\"…etc.) she started to get some serious \"die-hard\" fans. That’s because she is loved for her different \"bassy\" uplifting style, with the right technical moves at the right moment. This is how \"Dino’s\" became one of the most hot and busy spots, with the best sound and the best soundsystem, in the city. \r\n\r\nTogether with her dj-colleagues she experienced a full madhouse, every weekend for about 8 years. So through those years Miss Wendy has played together with dj’s like: Jean (iT), Guan Elmzoon (King Bee), Tom Harding (UK), Eric Nouhan, Dimitri, Per, Tall Paul (UK), Mark van Dale, Erik E, Miss Djax, Dano, Michel de Hey, Jurgen, Abraxas & Flamman (Fierce Ruling Diva), Robert Armani, Angel Moraes (USA), Billy Nasty (UK)…. \r\n\r\nNowadays she is a national and international talent and she is playing throughout Holland in clubs, events and festivals like: Heineken Music Hall (Amsterdam), Escape Venue (Amsterdam), Wester Unie (Amsterdam), Paradiso (Amsterdam), Dance Valley Festival (UDC), HouseQlassics (Q-Dance/ID&T), Extrema Festival (Eindhoven), Ground Zero Festival (UDC/Multigroove), MTV, TMF, Slam FM ... and in countries like: Switzerland (Loveparade / Zurichfest), Ibiza, Germany (Tunnel, Hamburg / Loveparade, Berlin), Belgium, Portugal, Bulgaria (Samsarabeach / Sofia), Russia, South Africa (Capetown), Tunis .... \r\n\r\nHer musicstyle has finetuned into a variety of electro, tribal, with techno-trance influences and still ofcourse always with a strong bass. By mixing different styles together, her musicsets will remain interesting, moving and pumping. These days she organizes the monthly MINX Exclusive parties in the \"Escape Venue\" in Amsterdam, together with Alex Motu, Tec909 parties, at the \"P3\" in Purmerend and their own Amsterdam Dance Radio/TV Live show, with co-host DJ Bob Squat.",

  "artist_bio": "Philosophy – “In a world where identity’s are created and left behind within days, it is only the ones that choose not to be anything, that can break loose from expectations… We do what we like, don’t assume anything, for identity calls for assumptions. Two individuals… Let the music speak for itself,\r\nopen yourself to expect the unexpected. – We are NO_ID.”NO_ID kicked off in the year 2008 and was formed by two Dutch local heroes from Amsterdam. They joint forces and instantly shook the Dutch DJ scene by winning the Amsterdam Dance Event Demolition Contest with one of their first tracks called “Wurld”. This track was nominated for best house track with commercial potential. NO_ID tries to create a new and fresh international big room, proggy techy house sound, that is rarely found nowadays on the Dutch dance floors. Constantly finding new ways to enthuse and arouse their audiences, that is what NO_ID stands for and where these two guys put their faith in. They are firm believers in the element of surprise and letting the music speak for itself as they play. Projects of NO_ID have been released on Cr2 Records, Armada Music, Ultra Records, Spinnin’ Records and others. Several of their projects have been remixed by Belocca (HU) and Muzzaik (HU) among others. They were also selected for the Dutch Sensation (ID&T) compilation of 2009, the Miami DJ MAG compilation of 2010 and multiple other worldwide compilation CD’s. The guys of NO_ID, now heading for the international borders, are meant to stay!",

  "artist_bio": "After she had said goodbye to her vinyl records she went into the challenge of building up her set with 4 lines in Tractor, creating a whole new sound. Her minimal-techno sounds raw, deep, heavy and slightly dark, around a BPM of 125.\r\n\r\nBesides DJ-ing she is focusing on the famous 'ON' sell-out parties, specialising in underground locations, which breathe techno! 'ON' represents a powerful mix of electronic music, a sublime atmosphere and unique location allowing the DJs to really immerse the crowds into the underground techno scene!\r\n\r\nBesides DJ-ing she started to produce herself. Already her first track released and the second coming up!\r\n\r\nFor bookings: info@on-and-on.nlFor as long as Rosie (aka Nicole Rosie) can remember dance music has ignited an inspiration and energy within her. DJ-ing had always been somewhat of a dream until, by chance, she met someone who owned a pair of decks. From that moment onwards she could be found sneaking behind the turntables experimenting with sound.\r\n\r\nFinally Rosie threw herself into truly mastering the art of mixing records for real. Very quickly she got hooked and DJ-ing has now become her passion. The first records she got her hands on were very minimalistic. Nowadays her sound is evolving more and more towards deep and dark techno, but minimal-techno remains the base around which her sets revolve.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that you've already run into her spinning records at top venues such as Flex Bar, Studio 80, Sugar Factory, the Bunker and the Dutch festivals Rockit and Dance Valley.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 Rosie started organising techno parties under the name “Onderstroom”. At Dance Valley and Rockit, “Onderstroom” was represented alongside Electronation. During this time parties were also held in the Sugar Factory in Amsterdam along with an illegal party of 400 people.\r\n\r\nThe period 2009 - 2010 was a real point of development for Rosie. She pushed her vinyl records aside and began mixing with Tractor. These days she builds her sets up with 4 lines in Tractor, creating a whole new sound. Her minimal-techno sounds raw, deep, heavy and slightly dark, around a BPM of 125.\r\n\r\nA difficult, but necessary decision was made in July 2010 to step away from her collaboration with “Onderstroom”. Although she loved every moment working with the guys and developing “Onderstroom” the feeling of her sound not ‘fitting in’ grew. This brings Rosie to a point now in her DJ-ing career where she is fully geared towards developing her own unique sound and contributing her flair to the evolution of techno.\r\n\r\nNowadays she is focusing on the famous 'ON' sell-out parties, specialising in underground locations, which breathe techno! 'ON' represents a powerful mix of electronic music, a sublime atmosphere and unique location allowing the DJs to really immerse the crowds into the underground techno scene! 'ON' has invited well-respected DJs including Chris Liebing, Gary Beck, Tommy Four Seven, Brian Sanhaji, Monoloc, PSYK and Jeff Rushin, together with talented local DJs, triggering an amazing breadth of sound.\r\n\r\nBesides DJ-ing she started producing herself. Already her first track 'Foxboy' released at the label Ketra records, and 'True Owl' (Frucht Label) and 'ON/OFF'(remix Jeff Rushin) (Wall Music) coming up.\r\n\r\nFor bookings:info@on-and-on.nl",

Van zijn oudere neef „supreme Cuisine” (Legends,Off The Wall) kreeg hij cassette bandjes met o.a. De La soul, EPMD, A tribe Called quest, Boyz II Men en Guy waarmee een diepe liefde voor Hip Hop & vinyl was geboren.De Vinyl collectie groeide al snel. Niet alleen hip hop maar ook soul disco funk en jazz en via de gebruikte samples was er altijd weer iets nieuws te ontdekken. op zijn 17de kreeg hij z’n eerste baantje bij Dancetracks, de locale platenzaak waar dj’s elke donderdag en zaterdag samen kwamen voor de nieuwe releases. De eerste dj gig was zo als gewoonlijk een schoolfeest. maar dan wel een op een speciale locatie, De legendarische club Roxy. Het eerste samen met „supreme cuisine” georganiseerde feest was Sugar & Vibes, samen met de toen al grotere namen als Kc The funkaholic, Leroy Rey en Real el Canario. als resident van Boss, Edelwise,Koffie Verkeerd en Wicked jazz sounds heeft hij z’n sporen in het uitgaansleven zeker verdient.\r\nin 2012 starte Zwarte Koffie in de club als een avond waar D-rok en Mr.- Speak weer naar hun roots gaan. soul funk hip hop jazz.en in nog geen 1.5 jaar tijd groeide het uit tot een avond die de Paradiso meer dan waardig is,en vanaf 7 feb is het dan ook zo ver!\r\ndus 2014 word bij voorbaat een topjaar voor Mr.Speak met alleen al 2 maandelijkse avonden in de Paradiso",

  "artist_bio": "Nick started showing more interest in music than average at around the age of 10. Around this time, a neighbor who was a DJ played some tunes for Nick, mainly hardcore as this was the hot sound in 1993. But Nick decided that he preferred a less harsh sound and started buying more and more CD's and albums ranging from eurodance to trance. A couple of years later, Nick got in touch with a friend who had some old audio equipment in the attic, and they started experimenting with it to make some mixes for the very first time. They both loved it and decided to buy some real tools for the trade. When their first turntables arrived, they started to build their collection of vinyl, which eventually led to experimentation with music production on the very old Trackers for DOS.Nick started showing more interest in music than average at around the age of 10.

A couple of years later, Nick got in touch with a friend who had some old audio equipment in the attic, and they started experimenting with it to make some mixes for the very first time. They both loved it and decided to buy some real tools for the trade. When their first turntables arrived, they started to build their collection of vinyl, which eventually led to experimentation with music production on the very old Trackers for DOS.\r\n\r\nTime flew by and Nick's tastes changed again, as he became more interested in electro, disco, and deephouse tracks. While working part-time to get some extra cash for vinyl, he met someone at work who shared the same interest in music production, and he taught Nick the basics of music production. This led to Nick getting his very first production signed to Toes In The Sand Recordings, which also signed him to do a remix of Brahma's track \"Peaks of Destiny.\" \r\n\r\nAfter a while, Nick hooked up with talented producer Eelke Kleijn to collaborate on productions. The partnership has been fruitful, with tracks signed at Ork Recordings, Kindred Sounds, Global Underground, Baroque, and more. Now that Nick graduated he is dedicated to finally unleash his vision of how music should be in a solo career. With tracks already signed at Manual Music, A Must Have and Outside The Box Music things are surely starting to look up. Next to this Nick also hosts the podcast named 'Below Sea Level'.\r\n\r\n'Below Sea Level' is a show which was later picked up by Proton Radio that will set your mind soaring. As you may have guessed, the name of the show is related to where Nick is based: The Netherlands. Next to this reference, it also stands for music that goes deeper. Below Sea Level lays focus on funky, soulful, rhythmic, beautifully melodic and deep music. As long as it moves Nick, he counts on the fact that his track selection will move you too!",

The sets are variable between energetic melodic techno, with different kind of energy levels.  Her appearances on radio stations like XT3 techno radio, Radio 538, Deep FM, and KLIKKmusic, her sets on a variety of parties in and outside Holland (Italy, Berlin, Brussel) and remixes she did for Snejl, Wide Angle Recordings, Rezongar, Inlab Recordings and Manual Music recently are proof examples of the recognition of her unique style.\r\n\r\nWebsites:\r\n\r\nwww.facebook.com/nadiastruiwigh\r\nwww.soundcloud.com/nadiastruiwigh\r\nwww.twitter.com/nadiastruiwigh\r\nhttp://dj.beatport.com/nadiastruiwigh\r\n\r\nBookings/ Requests\r\n\r\nNadia.struiwigh@gmail.com\r\nFrances@nrgmusiq.com / Yosser@nrgmusiq.com\r\n(France) Bookings@inlabrecordings.com\r\n\r\nFor unreleased stuff, send me a mail for a private link.",

Though few doubted his skills as an artist, most of Maurits neighbours thought different about his compositions, causing him to start producing music in the underground dungeons of Amsterdam. Coming out occasionally, but only at night, slowly made him well known among friends and enemies as Nachtbraker (Dutch for night hawk).\r\nThe signs of exposure to a wide range of genres are clearly hearable in his music, ranging from ecstatic slow grooves to unconventional dub tracks. Critics often praise him for adopting a wide pallet of sounds and subtle, detailed percussion. While his rare but celebrated performances receive increasing recognition, it’s unquestionable that Nachtbraker will keep a lot of people comfortably awake for the coming years.",

Ranging from dub, techno to house, his sound is always combined with a moody and raw vibe.\r\nGrowing up with many Hip Hop influences, and inspired by 90’s Hip Hop, MvdL bought his first turntables as a teenager and started playing vinyl. Shortly after, he had his first residency in a bar at his hometown. There he had the opportunity to play for a crowd and develop his DJ skills.\r\n\r\nWhen he moved to Utrecht, his love for underground house music started to grow. Inspired by Samuel Deep’s first DJ set, MvdL improved his sound and began playing more deeper grooves.\r\nAt that moment, he and some of his friends started throwing underground parties called “Boze Buren”. These parties became quite popular and as the co-founder and resident DJ of “Boze Buren” his DJ career took off. Shortly after MvdL played at clubs like: Toffler (Rotterdam), Club Poema (Utrecht), Central Studio’s (Utrecht) and Westerliefde (Amsterdam).\r\n\r\nIn 2012 MvdL released his first EP together with De Sluwe Vos under their alias “RAW Equipment” on the label Dorcas.\r\n\r\nRecently he moved to Amsterdam where MvdL is mainly focused on his solo productions. He has a strong, deep, no-nonsense, but delicate, signature groove in all his music.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, MvdL played at parties like Soenda Festival, Smeerboel Festival, Lief Festival, 12inch, I Am Techno, Mental Evolution, Verknipt, and so on.\r\n\r\nFor bookings, please contact mvdlbookings@gmail.com",

It is also a collaboration between Dimitri van Arnhem (1973) and Ivo Rotteveel(1975).Being both kids from the 70'ies, their youth has always been influenced by great music. At the age of 15, Ivo first set foot on the island of Ibiza and it was then that he made plans to succeed as a DJ. In the year 2000 Dimitri started his own club in his hometown Eindhoven. One night he met Ivo and offered him the opportunity to play a long set. Soon after Ivo became a resident, other promotors and venues started to notice his skills behind the decks and his ability to \"read\" a crowd. This resulted in a number of gigs both national and International, such as La Rocca (Belgium), Café d' Anvers (Antwerp), Club Risk (Amsterdam), Supperclub (Amsterdam), Home (Budapest), Extrema (Eindhoven), Circoloco (Antwerp) and Blue Marlin (Ibiza). Dimitri has always been the guy \"behind the scenes\",not trying to attract too much attention. On a production level they seemed to have found eachother, both musically and personally: Ivo, being the \"technical\" man and Dimitri, as ever, trying to push his creative boundaries.\r\nApril 2010 they got noticed by French techno godfather Laurent Garnier, putting their deep track \"Waking Up Benirras\" on the july playlist of his PBB Online Radioshow. One of 150 tracks: A scenario which definitely reflects their sound...being described as  a deep, melancholic, dramatic, film noir. Recently started their own label: Lowendcommunity, initially releasing productions of artists N.U.D.E., The Low End Theory, Ivo Foreal, Doscar, Dimi Angelis, Jeroen Search, Stefan Vincent, Bas Struik, J.Flannan and Alessandro Diga\r\nAs N.U.D.E. they will rock festivals and clubs all over Holland, like Rockit Open Air, Circoloco (30/10/2010), Cocoon at Cafe d'Anvers and many many more.\r\n",

Inspired by the good vibes and sense of overall wellbeing she experienced on the legendary party island of Ibiza, she returned to her hometown - determined to become a DJ herself.Enter the year 2015 and Mrs Smith is more active than ever. Focusing more and more on her styles of choice, mainly deep house and tech house, her sound matured in the past year and now follows the lead of industry heavyweights like Miss Melera and Eelke Kleijn.  She has played in venues like Panama Amsterdam, Beatclub and Odeon. And she made it to the final of the Pioneer Benelux DJ contest 2014 and became a resident for Huisgemaakt (BE) and Tram 10. In 2013 she won the Dj contest by Listig Producties in cooperation with Deephouse Database and Nachtcollege. \r\n\r\nDriven to cover the whole spectrum of her work as a DJ, Deborah also made her first steps as a producer. She is still modest about it: \"I am definitely working hard to reach the goal that I set for myself and for me it is key to know that eventually I will be able to play my own tracks when I am DJing live. But I am good at keeping secrets, so let me just tell you that right now, it is still a work in progress!\" \r\n\r\nThis year already looks very good for Mrs Smith. With her studio ambitions and the drive to make it into the line-up of the world's ruling festivals, it is only going to be a matter of time before she performs on an event near you.",

As time went by, he found his true passion in house \r\nand (dub)techno. \r\n\r\nWith an African percussionist as a father and a mother who \r\nfills her days with dancing jazz, music was an easy choice.\r\nNathan Surreal is a producer at heart. The founder of KMS Records, the \r\nlegendary Kevin Saunderson, noticed this in 2014, when Nathan released his \r\n'Binary Omania' EP on his Detroit based label and received full support from \r\nKevin and artists like DJ3000, Greg Gow, Andrew Duke, Anthony Shakir, \r\nColin Dale, Vince Watson, Stacey Pullen and Richard Hawtin. Next to this \r\nsuccess there is also the 'Illustrator' EP, with a remix from Dantiez \r\nSaunderson on Repressure Recordings. Nathan Surreal’s upcoming release \r\n'Area Code’ is scheduled on DJ 3000’s Motech Records early 2015. \r\nEven though Nathan has had successes when it comes to his releases, he \r\ndoesn’t solely live in his studio. \r\n\r\nAs a DJ he already conquered three \r\nresidencies in Holland: [IN]COGNITO, Liefhebbers and Kaap A’dam. He \r\nplayed at festivals such as A Day At The Park, Mystic Garden and Gaasper \r\nPleasure. Studio 80, Club Up, Club Poema and PIP were rocked as well as venues in \r\nBelgium, Luxembourg and Cape Verde. Next up is his own LIVE set, where \r\nhis predilection for analogue gear (Korg Mono/Poly) is strengthened. \r\n\r\nNext to his talent he also enjoys great knowledge in music. This has definitely \r\ngrown at the Conservatory of Tilburg, where he is now about to finish his Bachelor \r\nin Music Technology. Next to absorbing information, he also shares it with \r\nothers – when he is teaching at the Herman Brood Academie in Utrecht, or \r\nwhen he is working as a musical curator for party organizations in \r\nAmsterdam.",

From the nightlife experiences where he was able to indulge in music by his favorite Italian DJs, such as Ralf and Claudio Coccoluto, he was able to further develop his ear and taste for quality music. After contemplating on how he could fit into the equation, he decided to take a bold step and contribute to the scene himself by sharing through djing. After countless of times where he received positive reinforcement, he decided to leave Italy and take it to the next level… in Amsterdam.",

His work, part of which also included being responsible for the creative direction and booking of former Club 11, has raised the bar of what is considered a “good night out in Amsterdam” substantially. Boswijks strong musical vision has helped to introduce artists like Âme, Dixon and Trentemoller to the Dutch dance scene.\r\n\r\nBy focussing on the deeper, groovier and more jacking spectrum of electronic dance music, Olaf creates exactly that slow- burning madness that works incredibly well on the more sophisticated dancefloors. His Sunday residency at Trouw is a favour- ite night of many locals for that exact reason. Growing demand for this DJ nationally and internationally is no coincidence.",

They can now be found DJ'ing at many of Europes biggest festivals.Frederik\r\nFredrik bought the first house records at the age of fourteen, started mixing at the age of sixteen, and at eighteen he released his first records under his own label Gyrate records. The same year, he entered the house party scene playing his first gigs. Soon after, he gained European recognition as a DJ - with appearances ranging from the UK to Italy. Nowadays he can be found playing every Saturday night at The Fuse in Brussels (Belgium) as their only Dutch resident.\r\n\r\nDJ. Pako\r\nAs a grafitti artist Pako was influenced by his record collection of mid- eighties hip-hop/electro; he soon broadened his musical outlook after being introduced to house music. This introduction led him to compile his own collection of twelve inches, resulting in his first gig in 1993. Production work in the studio followed soon after. \r\n\r\nPako & Frederik first crossed paths in 1992, through an introduction by a mutual friend. But it took a 1993 meeting to bring their two styles together. The place: a studio in the south of France. The result: the birth of their first collaboration (with Remy): 'Vauvenage'. From this moment on Pako and Frederik joined forces to produce numerous club-hits for a Dutch label called Absolut Records. Their musical style attracted many; gaining them a spot on playlists from international DJ's such as Carl Cox, Sasha, John Digweed, Derrick May, Danny Howells, Chris Harshman, Jerry Bonham and Derrick Carter. Since 1995 Pako & Frederik perform live, appearing at numerous house-parties, clubs and internationally attended festivals such as I Love Techno (Belgium) and Dancevalley. \r\n\r\nMajestic\r\nIn 1996 Pako & Frederik started their Majestic project. It involves running their own independent label, Majestic Music, and remixing and producing as Majestic. Several tracks of their first two releases made an immediate impact on Europe, Asia, the UK, North America and Australia. This world-wide recognition soon led to numerous requests for their remix work, with their remix credits appearing on Nervous NY, WGW Belgium, DMC UK and more.\r\n\r\nTheir tracks featured on compilations mixed by: Sasha & Digweed (Northern Exposure + Live in Sydney), Carl Cox (F.A.C.T.), Derrick Carter (Back To Basics), Chris Harshman (Future Progressive), Jerry Bonham (Spundae) to name a few. \r\n\r\nCurrent projects include their third Majestic ep which is again a mixture of different styles and the launch of their new label Taboo Records, for the more discoish cuts.",

Whether it’s running his own label “Something Happening Somewhere,” producing music, or DJing, you can feel that Nuno is utterly in love with what he does. \r\n\r\nThis love translates into an almost obsessive curiosity for fresh music. Whereas most DJs limit themselves to one style and stick with it, Nuno fuses different genres and creates a unique style and sound of his own. Combining that creative flexibility with a telepathic ability to read a dance floor, he is able to build the sort of memorable sets that only someone with years of experience can. From deep house to serene techno, old classics to modern gems, Nuno has it covered.\r\n\r\nNuno Dos Santos is also an acclaimed producer who has worked both solo and in collaboration with artists like Patrice Baumel, Estroe and TJ Kong (with whom he released the broadly praised full length album, After Dark, My Sweet in 2010) and has done so on established labels like Compost, Planet E, Green Records, Traum and Connaisseur. His sound is created using his deep knowledge of music and veers from sublime techno to more emotional house as exemplified by classic tracks like ‘Merging’, ‘Hamming’ and ‘Mon Toy.’\r\n\r\nProof of his abilities comes from the fact that he headlines the most upbeat clubs around Europe and America. Nuno has also been a resident and key figure at legendary clubs Trouw and Club 11, Amsterdam, where his unique sense of musical storytelling have developed and bloomed over the years. \r\n\r\nHis long-term experience and predicting trends ahead of time have served him well and now feed back into his role as label owner at SoHaSo. \"The name itself leaves a lot open for your own imagination,” says Nuno himself, who has so far released essential music by the likes of Love over Entropy, Dixon, The Drifter, Sigward and Kurt Baggaley. “I want to release musical material from befriended producers, new talent and my own work on Something Happening Somewhere.\" After hosting a successful run of events at Trouw, SoHaSo now holds regular label nights at Tivoli (Utrecht) and Paradigm (Groningen). This is yet another part of the way in which Nuno Dos Santos is spreading his musical vision throughout the world.",

  "artist_bio": "The Many faces of Orlando Voorn \r\nDJ/Producer/Artist/Performer/Entertainer/Legend\r\nCheck out the Music: http://soundcloud.com/orlando-voornWho is Orlando Voorn? \r\n\r\nHe is one of the first Dutch musicians to establish a vital connection between Detroit and Amsterdam in the early 90’s. Orlando Voorn has long been recognized as one of the Netherland’s most original and ingenious producers in the world of electronic dance music. Voorn began DJing at the early age of 12 years old and later went on to win his first scratch competition at Amsterdam “Club Flora Palace”. Amazingly Voorn did this by borrowing records from his competitor. \r\nAfter winning that competition he continued to practice every day and was discovered by a Dutch Radio host named “Robin Albers” who was in charge of the Dutch DMC DJ Championship 1986. Surprisingly Voorn placed 1st in the Dutch competitions 1986 & 1987 for Holland which placed him in the world championships of DMC twice in the United Kingdom where he came in 3rd place 86 and 5th place 87 spinning with his own characteristic blend of hip hop, and electro music'. \r\nTowards the end of the eighties he acquired his first sequencer and turned his hand to producing his productions, his first project was under the alias “Fixomatic” – “Hurt em Bad” the track was an old school hip hop record and sold very well for that period of time. Voorn has a great vision for combining sounds, rhythms and key structures. When you look at Voorn’s past it mainly consist of 2 important factors. He started playing the drums at an early age of 9 years old and having professional drumming lessons although he could not comprehend reading notes his drum teacher said to his parents “Orlando doesn’t need to read notes” he was indeed a natural and could play everything that was shown to him once. \r\nLater on Voorn produced a couple of tracks based on sampling music; he met with Steve Clisby from a successful band called the “American Gypsies” in the early 80's. Clisby was intrigued by the way Voorn put together a production based upon samples; when an agreement was established Voorn worked together with Clisby who would teach Orlando chord structures. This was a major step for Orlando as it changed his view on productions tremendously. As he no longer needed to use only samples but he could in fact create a track/composition from playing it all with keys, bass lines, piano's etc… \r\n\r\nSubsequently Voorn made a name for himself under the alias \"Frequency\" with a classic label known as Lower East Side Records with titles such as \"Where is Your Evidence” “Kiss the Sky” and “Industrial Metal”. As a result of these tracks Voorn was introduced to Juan Atkins and they later started to collaborate & produce tracks together at Voorn's home studio where he remixed “Industrial Metal’ while Juan tweaked the sounds to make them come out of the speakers a little more pulsating. Atkins & Voorn worked extraordinarily well together and Juan taught Orlando how to merge the sounds as well as how to change the standards of conventional productions. \r\n\r\nSoon after they would join forces and produce the well know track called \"Game One\" which became a classic record on Atkin’s label “Metroplex” and later it reprised on Voorn’s imprint “Nightvision” double CD Compilation 1996. In that same time span Voorn had met Blake Baxter and collaborated for the infamous ESP Records and under the alias \"The Ghetto Brothers\" they made 2 EP's with timeless classics as \"Ghetto Disco\" and\" Ghetto Blues\". \r\nVoorn also did recordings for a legendary Detroit label “KMS” an imprint of Kevin Saunderson using yet another alias known as \"Fix\" where he created a dance floor destroyer track called \"Flash\" which remains in many DJ's crates at this moment. “Flash” became a hit in the Detroit clubs first before the record had broken out internationally. Voorn has a well know history of working with Detroits originator’s including Derrick May's imprint “Fragile” under yet another alias “Complex” entitled “Midi Merge”. \r\n\r\nVoorn used many Aliases’ back when he started to produce records in order to present various styles of music without limitation to producing only techno. It was a common fad to use fictitious names as it is today. Voorn has never limited himself to one particular style of producing. You could easily say that he is incredibly versatile in switching between many styles that demonstrates him as a well known producer.\r\n\r\nOrlando even inspired Deadmau5 a character who wears a big mousehead on his head and is more of an entertainer has remixed Paco di Bango in 2009 with more then 120.000 youtube hits and performs it all over the world and made a new audience aware of Orlando’s Music.\r\nAliases’ being used over two decades are: \r\n\r\nBalance, Baruka, Basic Bastard, Complex, Defence, Dope Dog, Fix, Fixomatic, Format, Frequency, Galaxy,The Judge,Limited Edition , Living Room, Maniax Traxxx, Mute, The Nighttripper,PB 2000, Playboy, Progress,Solar, The Stalker,Tank,Trigger, Ultra, Urban Nature, X-It and Orlando Voorn. \r\nIn Groups: Blak Presidents, Designer Loops, Ghetto Brothers, OBGB and Infiniti.\r\n\r\nOrlando Voorn Labels are :NightVision,Divine,Ignitor,Triangle & Slamdunk \r\nStill going strong in 2010 Voorn is still raising the bar with productions & Remixes. \r\nHe has 2 active Labels Divine & Night Vision \r\n\r\nVarious Remixes. He does not only work with well known people but also give new talent a chance to shine. \r\n\r\nFuture releases: Voorn currently is working on an Album for Big & Dirty label Various Remix work for known and new artists. \r\n\r\nAlong with side projects on various labels including his own \r\nVoorn's NightTripper project will be re released on vinyl on Underground Liberation Records With Remixes by Various well known producers that respect Voorn's work. After more than two decades Mr. Voorn can look back on a solid career leaving a legacy of dance music from the past, present & future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Gangsta techno? The description of one of Amsterdam talent ONNO’s Panorama Bar sets on his SoundCloud page may be tongue­in­cheek, but it’s not a bad shout in terms of a phrase to capture what his sound is all about. Blending slender techno groove with housey texture and rhythm ­ and a little of his beloved hip­hop’s attitude ­ his is a sound that has found a home on acclaimed imprints like ViVA, Saved, Moon Harbour, Souvenir, Quartz, Upon.You, International Deejay Gigolos and Get Physical.Growing up amongst Holland’s consistently bustling dance music culture, ONNO went from bedroom DJ to being snapped up as the youngest ever resident at Amsterdam’s legendary Chemistry parties in a matter of years. Cutting his teeth at their parties from the age of 16, he was resident by the time he was just 19 years old. “Here I discovered house and techno from all across the board’ he says. “From the US guys like Kerri Chandler, to Germans like DJ Hell and techno guys like Josh Wink and Dave Angel. I played my first gig there warming up for a then very young D'Julz.” His production career began some years later, releasing his first Masterdam EP in 2009 (a homage to his home city) and after a few years of honing his craft his rapid ascent to the top began.\r\nForging a relationship with Marco Resmann’s Upon.You proved to be the turning point that really kickstarted his production game, the label signing one of his tracks in 2009 for a various artists EP before releasing a slew of his material over the next four years. This Berlin connection opened many new doors for him, both as a DJ and a producer. “Next to releasing my music, they gave me the chance to experience Berlin and play at places like Panorama Bar, Watergate and Bar25 which all shaped me both musically and personally.”\r\n“I take a lot of influences from old hip­hop,” he says of his muscular sounds, “something I've been listening to since I was a teenager. I think especially the old east coast stuff like Mobb Deep, Wu­Tang and early Biggy stuff is still very much an influence in my music today. What appeals to me in this music most is the attitude towards the the production, more so than the lyrical message it tries to bring across. Everything has this ‘I don't give a fuck’ mentality which translates into this rough, sleazy, stripped and to the point sound that is perfectly suitable to house and techno as well. Also, the creative use of sampling and recycling old bits of music into something fresh which hip­hop is known for is something I love doing in my own music as well.”\r\nListen carefully and what may at first seem an obtuse connection makes perfect sense: a focus on weighty low end, killer swinging grooves and a no­nonsense approach to making people move. That and the occasional heavily treated rap vocal samples, of course. Rap aside, he draws inspiration from across the board to colour his sonic palette. “Hearing great DJs play can be an influence for me too. But when I am not producing or playing I tend to listen to a lot of non­ electronic music, which unconsciously influences you as well of course. Also, I tend to take inspiration from a lot of different things, be it (music) documentaries, traveling, discovering new cities and meeting new people.”\r\nWith residencies at Ibiza’s Ushuaia (for Ants) and Amsterdam’s Studio 80 under his belt, appearances at huge festivals including Future Festival, Mysteryland and Fusion Festival ­ not to mention a hectic worldwide touring schedule ­ his acclaim as a DJ continues to grow across the globe. With further releases on Truesoul, Circus, Snatch!, KD Musik, AMA, Inmotion and his consistent partners Upon.You and VIVa, his prolific output knows no bounds and looks set to continue elevating his star into the upper reaches of the house and techno world.\r\nMore info: www.djonno.com",

During the early 90′s these parties featured a lot of DJ’s that would prove to be very big names, Tim played alongside Stacy Pullen, Marcello, Dimitri, Joost van Bellen and many more.\r\n\r\nGetting more and more involved in the production side of dance music and being aware of the growing potential of the computer and electronic instruments, he noticed there was a lack of knowledge for the average user. Seeing a big opportunity Tim and his business partner Guss started a specialized shop called ‘Midi Amsterdam’ and for the last 16 years it has been a stable source of the finest equipment and valuable information for many producers and DJs, both established and those just starting out.\r\n\r\nAs old habits die hard, Tim is now getting back into producing music full force. After being a resident DJ at ‘Chanders Residence’ and ‘De Fietznfabriek’ in Haarlem, he’s joined forces with sax player Stanley B as Mr Cazanova feat. Stanley B. Both of them also perform live, combining live sax and DJ sets on stage. Nova Caza is Tim’s solo project. His first release on the XQisit imprint is titled ‘Techtoy‘ and puts him right back where his heart is, blending music and keeping people moving.",

Making hip hop beats with a double cassette player/recorder.\r\nHe bought his first serious turntables and mixer around 1990 and became the Dj and Mc of a hip-hop band. \r\nThis band produced several hip-hop tracks and performed in the South of the Netherlands. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately the band broke up, but the new jungle and drum&bass style was a good reason to continue as a Dj. \r\nHis first Dj set was at the legendary RnB club Luxor in Arnhem as Dj Huntah. \r\nHe was mainly interested in this urban scene but something changed. \r\n\r\nOzani paid his first visit to a house club in 1993, after being invited and persuaded by a friend. \r\nThis visit infected him with the house virus and totally changed his music preference. \r\nHis first house session was in 1994 at Mallorca Spain. \r\nAfter that playing at several clubs and events for 5 summers. \r\nStarting with funky techno, club, deep house, tech house & 2-step music, he finally found his sound in deep house, funky house and tech house. \r\n\r\nHe became the resident Dj of Incrowd (Groene Engel) & Sensual (Teatro Salsa deep house sessions), that was in the South of the Netherlands. \r\nOzani joined a dj collective in 2005 named HouseStation, which was founded by a good friend. \r\nThis organization started as a non-profit Internet radio station, but soon hosted several events and festivals like Gigadance festival (all editions), Doornroosje (VET), Puma & Invite. \r\n\r\nSome more Ozani appearances are: Doornroosje (KISS KISS Club), TWSTD, ZIP, HMH, Soulmate, Indian Summer Festival (Extrema main stage), Club Inferno, HIP fashion shows (dj set & music composition), Hemels!, WATT festival, Lariekoeque festival, Come Out And Play festival, Wanderlust festival, Festival Ensuite and many more. \r\n\r\nYou could say that this artist had a lot of influences with respect to electronic music. \r\nThis made him the dj and producer of today. Don't believe the hype (Public Enemy)!",

When he was 10 years old, he loved playing the piano and he put a lot of time in it. Nevertheless, after a couple of years he decided to play the guitar instead. At this stage of his life he was already familiar with electronic music. Faithless was his favorite dance group and all the song texts were memorized for life. After having visited a couple of concerts of Faithless and Festivals like Lowlands he really was addicted. He was fascinated how these artists made the crowd go wild. Being a constant follower of electronic music, he decided to start DJ-ing at the age of 14.\r\n\r\nAfter a year of practice he started to play at some small parties. Not too long after that, he played at ‘de Lichtfabriek’, a venue at his hometown Haarlem, and more gigs followed. Nowadays, he playes at Holland’s pride Club Stalker as a resident for 'I Love Donderdagnacht', Zandvoort Alive Festival and beach clubs like Woodstock 69 and Beachclub Vroeger. He also takes part in dj contests and that led him to play at radiobroadcast KinkFM with Electronation.\r\n\r\nWith his groovy tech/deep house sounds he gets you in the mood to go wild. He is also a producer and the first release is a reality. With a lot more tracks and gigs coming up P. Jones is ready!\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Overtracked is a young upcoming deep house DJ/producer. He’s 20 years old and lives in Rotterdam.\r\nSome of his tracks are released on record labels like Armada Deep, Housepital & Big Boss Records.\r\nHe’s known for the UK house sounds and his deep bass drops.\r\nMany of his tracks has been supported by De Sluwe Vos, Buurman & Buurman, Peter Gelderblom, Truth Be Told, Santos Suarez …\r\nReferences: Amsterdam Dance Event / Club Panama / Partyclub Rotterdam / Club La Costera / Renesse / …From a young age it already seemed like the artists was fated togo the production route, picking up the art at the age of 16 when he and his friends began learning how to produce progressive house. After receiving much praise and positive feedback the decision was made to take music production seriously. Under a small label his first release came out, although his roots are buried in electro house it was long before he was attracted to UK Deep House ( The House mason Approves).\r\n\r\nSo where did it all start? As a youngster in the Netherlands it wasn’t all house music as he recalls his favourite artists were actually Eminem and Linkin Park. It wasn’t until he bought his first beat port track got a Feeling by Josh Butler that he really got a feel of what house music was all about. As this love of House Music grew, so did his passion for the sound. These days he still maintains that Josh Butler is amongst one of the artists that he admires. Although he did state that it’s not really the artist or their innovations that inspire him but more the crowd, the people and the club. Rotterdam is a city full of many large night clubs that play host to many House music events and it is attending these events and witnessing the energy that House Music brought with it and the sheer passion that its creators had which spurred the producer on to pursue this dream.\r\n\r\nSo with some production and live performance experience we asked do you get nervous before a performance and in general what advice would you give people who wish to go down the same path as you and he answered “Previously when I first started, I was super nervous when I had to perform. Nowadays I do not get nervous anymore. I do more than 70 gigs a year right now. The advice I give to producers who want to get noticed. Just make cool tracks, and put it on your Soundcloud as a free track. If your track is cool, just make sure that the big names support your track. That’s the way our track  ‘Troubleman’ was signed on Armada Music. We put it on our Soundcloud as a free track, and a couple of weeks later Armada Music asked us if they can sign our track to their label. There are a lot of deejays and producers in the world, but I think that’s a good thing. And if you work hard and believe in yourself you can do it. If you don’t believe in yourself, how do expect anyone else to? I know it’s hard sometimes when you make a cool track and you mail it to five labels and none of them respond.  But its part of the deal you know” so in summary work hard, believe in yourself and have a lot of persistence.",

  "artist_bio": "Magnetron Music's head-honcho Parker Jones has been around for a long time, he started his first label in 1991 and soon became A & R/labelmanager for several other recordcompanies. It wasn't until 1999 before he started dj-ing on a more professional level. Since than he has played all around the world, from Salvador in Brazil to Sofia in Bulgaria and from Stockholm in Sweden to Sevilla in Spain. His main job however is releasing quality music on his own label and helping artist to develop on other labels.Parker Jones has been a driving force behind the Dutch music scene since the late eighties. Being brought up in a very musical family, he had the opportunity to listen to a lot of different musical styles throughout his live. His father, a jazz drummer and bebop fan, showed him the hidden treasures of his record collection and a whole new world opened up. No wonder Parker Jones' musical taste is rooted in jazz music. But as a true rebellious teenager he also started to listen to other music; punk rock, disco, reggae, funk, ska, soul, early electro, latin, hip hop, African and Asian music. A truly eclectic vinyl junkie with the need to score.\r\nWhen house music first hit the European mainland in 1987 Parker Jones was captivated immediately and it wasn't long before he started his first recordlabel, unfortunately this label died a premature death. But the love for real House music and Detroit techno survived. He started dj-ing, organizing parties and writing about his newfound love for several different magazines. In 1993 Parker Jones was asked to join the largest European dance recordcompany, where he, anonymously compiled and mixed over 40 house and techno cd's. As head of the A & R department he produced, made remixes and worked with many different artist, such as; Roy Davis jr., Speedy J, Aux 88, Herbert, Laidback Luke, Phuture, Orlando Voorn, Peven Everett, Steve Stoll, Guru, Seymour Bits (a.k.a. Bastian, Gifted, Fatima Yamaha), Mike Dearborn, The Freaks and Recloose to name but a few. \r\nHis time-consuming daytime job was standing in the way of his own creative output and by the turn of the century Parker Jones felt the need to go his own way again and focus on his own production work and especially his career as a dj. Since then he has played his eclectic, deep, yet stompin' house, techno and electrofunk sounds for many people all the world, from Salvador in Brazil to Sofia in Bulgaria and from Stockholm in Sweden to Sevilla in Spain, alongside such dj’s as Luke Solomon, Brett Johnson, Doc Martin, Melon and San Proper. Parker Jones is a regular guest at Club Risk, Paradiso, 020, Panama, Stalker, Integrate in the Netherlands, but he also played at Dance Valley, the prestigious Music Festival of Cannes in France and other festivals and parties around the globe. \r\nAt the end of 2004 Parker Jones and Seymour Bits joined forces and started a new recordcompany called Magnetron Music, which specializes in electro, funk, techno, pop and house with an electronic feel.\r\n",

PONY can take you to one of the highest mountains, but five minutes later you sit back in a relaxed chair, enjoying the mellow beats in a nostalgic New Orleans nightclub.\r\n\r\nPONY sees musical innovation as their biggest challenge. Looking beyond traditional production methods is something that defines PONY. They don’t limit themselves to music as such, because their inspiration for their productions also comes from other forms of art.\r\n\r\nBecause “Music Has The Right To Children”, PONY tends to look at music as if they still were 7 year old boys that listened to the radio. No prejudices about certain music genres, and remain open minded about every musical genre. In order to stand out above the crowd, nowadays it is absolutely vital to not stick to one safe point, but improve yourself, and this can only happen if you welcome new ways of thinking. And this is what PONY does!\r\n\r\nTheir first release on Digital Sintope with Karmon caught the attention of many great artists and this is just the beginning of a promising career.\r\n\r\n- Respect your roots, but do not stick to them -",

Besides these concepts he’s working as the booker of Hollands most underground technoclub; Club Poema in Utrecht. \r\n\r\nDynamo \r\nIn 2006 Paul Boex meets Marco Rane and they started a project to emerge and combine their forces and skills to create a mixed up sound with a lot of uplifting percussion, pounding basslines and floating synths. Under the name Dynamo they form a collaboration where they both can create their own musical interests with no boundaries attached. They developed their own sound loaded with power and energetic sources which explains the name Dynamo.\r\nThese guys are developing them self on and on, with productions on well respected labels as Arms, Aftertaste Recordings, Naked Lunch and of course on Paul’s own imprint Dynamic Reflection they are breaking it down!\r\n\r\nDynamic Reflection \r\nIn the year 2008 he starts his own label called ‘Dynamic Reflection’, to support the pure meaning of techno. The label got a lot of respect in a short amount of time all across the globe by artists, such as Dave Clarke, Ben Sims, Surgeon, Oscar Mulero, Luke Slater, The Advent and many others.\r\n \r\nMore info at:\r\n• ?www.myspace.com/paulboex\r\n• www.paulboex.com\r\n• www.souncloud.com/paul-boex\r\n• www.facebook.com/paulboex\r\n• www.twitter.com/paulboex \r\n• www.mental-evolution.nl \r\n\r\nPaul Boex vs Joton [4 decks and 2 mixers + FX]\r\nPaul Boex and Joton met each other in 2007 via Myspace. They started to share their visions and passion about music and events for a while which created a special bond between these two. Till this day on they have become really good friends and started to work more often with each other on producing music, promoting events and sharing their thoughts and developments about the music business nowadays.\r\nAs they both are most highly driven to develop themselves on and on in their DJ sets, they came up with the idea to start a new project where they play on 4 decks, 2 mixers and FX. The first gig they did was on the 3 years Anniversary of Mental Evolution in Hollands most undergound technoclub; Club Poema, performing the closing set of the night. The crowd went wild and the chemistry between these two guys went so well, that they have decided to make it an exclusive project. Next event was the notorious \"TechnoFlash\" where they played between Oscar Mulero and Ben Sims, again total mayhem. \r\n\r\nThey are putting their excellent DJ skills to the test and take you on a trip where different styles are merged into a throbbing tale. From deep to stimulating, from funky to pounding off-beat, sinister soundscapes .... everything will pass in this energetic battle. \r\n\r\nNext to this they both own a well respected label. Paul is the man behind “Dynamic Reflection” and Joton is the man behind “New Rhythmic”.\r\n",

However, the influence of those early rave tracks always plays an important role in his productions.\r\n\r\nUpcoming 2015 gigs include Milkshake Festival and Mysteryland, as well as regular dj appearances at Perron (R’dam), Paradiso (A’dam), Disco Flamingo (R’dam) and Bahn (R’dam). Next to that he’s been on fire in the studio lately, working on new releases, to be released on his own Pastel Recordings.\r\n\r\nPOA will soon see his new collab single with Bluntspeakers, called ‘Drummachine’ and his upcoming solo club banger ‘Love u more‘ released on Pastel Recordings. The label stands for an openminded approach towards house music. There’s loads of fresh releases lined up already so do keep an eye on the Pastel website or like the Pastel Facebook page to stay in the loop.\r\n\r\nNext to this Pop On Acid easily morphs into an entrepreneur under his Dirk Schmidt disguise. Last year he saw his longtime dream come true by opening up Rotterdam based underground social club ‘Bahn’. The club provides him with the perfect setting and opportunity to spread his profound love for music, invite and embrace nu breed and established talent as well as a platform for his unique ideas about night entertainment.",

Their vision when they produce are nonetheless equal; they explore different tonal and rhythmic grounds in the area of electronic music. These differences are reflected from a range between deep and liquid to dark and rough. In the long run, this variety in their productions and sets will keep the audience triggered and thrilled in different ways.

  "artist_bio": "DJ, producer + founder and owner of the Manual Music record company. \r\nCheck out the full biography for more info..Paul Hazendonk was born in the suburbs of Rotterdam in 1982. As a young kid he already developed an excessive interest for music, quickly discovering house music and noticing the deejays who were mixing records together. He found his passion..\r\n\r\nHe got his first club gig at age 18 and after that it all seemed like one big rollercoaster ride. In the first years of his carreer he already played at some of Hollandʼs most infamous clubs, parties and festivals. Shortly after, his talents also got noticed abroad, taking him to over 20 different countries to perform throughout the years.\r\n\r\nPaul started his first label, Technique, back in 2002 whilst working at the legendary record company and store Basic Beat which was located in the heart of Rotterdam. Nowdays both Technique and Basic Beat are defunkt but Paul is more active than ever in the record business, being the owner of the Manual Music company. Manual Music releases music on various (sub)labels, takes care of artist management, digital distribution and music publishing.\r\n\r\nHaving always been a DJ first and a producer second, it took some time before Paul got busy in the studio, but in the last couple of years his name as a producer is getting more and more known globally, after having signed to respected labels such as Hope Recordings, Diynamic Music, Sleaze Records, Einmusika, Sudbeat, Proton Music, Lowbit Records + naturally his own label Manual Music.\r\n\r\nBoth his DJ and production style has evolved throughout the years from full on techno to a more mature sound, music with an infectious drive, blending (deep)house, and melodic techno, depending on time and place of performance.. But who cares for all those genre tags anyway,right?",

In that same period, a pioneer in mixing, Ben Liebrand, launched the Grandmix on the radio once a year. From that moment he started mixing with records on his Technics SL 1200’s turntables, playing at local school parties and youth-clubs.\r\nWhen he heard one of the first house records “love can turn around” from\r\nFarley Jackmaster Funk, he was inspired by the sounds of Chicago, the uplifting baselines and kicks.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting clubs like The Amsterdam It in the late 80’s and The Roxy early 90’s, it was clear that DJ-ing is his thing to do.\r\n\r\nWith many national and international gigs he already played the groovy, tech, deep-house sound at parties, clubs and festivals like Magneet Amsterdam, Sundaypeople & Woodlands.\r\n\r\nNext to DJ-ing he spent much time in his fully equipped sound studio and a user of Ableton since this program was released on the market.\r\n\r\n(In the year 2014 he did a TEDx talk about DJ-ing, producing in combination with the family life)",

Spending his teens listening to everything from grunge to trance, from classical music to drum and bass, Piet now makes detailed electronic music with soul. His tracks are as enjoyable on the dance floor as they are in the living room.\r\n\r\nReleasing on labels like Audiomatique, Wolfskuil Records and Manual Music, his techno-oriented tracks and remixes have found their way into DJs’ bags and people’s iPods. Piet enjoys collaborating with other artists, ranging from opera singers to rappers, from symphony orchestras to hardcore producers.\r\n\r\nFrom 2006 onwards, Piet has performed at numerous clubs and festivals, from Awakenings to Dance Valley, Amsterdam to Berlin, late at night till early in the morning. Armed with his laptop and controllers, he cuts, slices and rearranges his sounds, taking the crowd on a journey through sound.\r\n\r\n2011 will be an exciting year for Piet, as he will release another solo EP on Steve Bug’s Audiomatique Recordings, as well as releasing several EPs featuring the fantastic London-based singer Patchy.",

Born on Valentine’s Day, in the year house music took its first steps towards Europe, 1989. Since his first steps on this world as a toddler, Pieter has been breathing music. This Dutchman has his first osculation with the turntables at the age of 13, since then he developed himself and has been constantly working on innovating dance music.\r\n\r\nNowadays Steijger has a broad experience and created an unique sound: characterized as pure and quality techno with influences from deephouse and electronica. His character is described as a tranquil person, but when you put him in a DJ booth or lock him in the studio, he really creates madness and ensures that the public gets a mind blowing experience.\r\n\r\nPieter founded his own imprint Frameworx Music in 2008, where he released most of his discography. His tracks “Body Language” and “Deviation” were released on Amsterdam based label 90Watts Music. He also released music on labels like Global Underground, Retouch Recordings and Kompakt. In 2013 Pieter Steijger released his first artist album 'Luminosity' on his label Frameworx Music. \r\n\r\nPieter’s talent did not go unnoticed as he got major feedback the last few years from the likes of; Marco Carola, Richie Hawtin, Christian Smith, Pig & Dan, Luciano, Kevin Saunderson, Shlomi Aber, Gregor Tresher, Saeed Younan, Nick Warren and many others. His tracks also got airplay at Adam Beyer’s Drumcode Radio Show, John Digweed’s Transitions show, BBC Radio 1, Proton Radio, and Radio 538 Dance Department.",

Benno has no experience at all in producing, but he has a perfect ear for good melodies, due to his classical musical background by playing the piano and the keyboard. They decide to cooperate and the first releases as Pedro & Benno soon follow. Their records are put on the decks by numerous DJ's and they are asked for remixes by Jean, Ferry Corsten and Cygnus X. \r\n\r\nBut it is their own 'Airwave', the theme of Innercity Hollands biggest indoor danceparty, that puts RANK 1 really in the spotlights. Their remix of Cygnus X's 'Superstring' was last years Sensation theme. The images of the videoclip, recorded at the event in the magnificent Amsterdam ArenA stadium, nowadays find their way through whole Europe and are to be seen in countries such as The United States of America, Japan and South-Africa as well. \r\n\r\nAs for 2001, RANK 1 has a tight schedule. First of all there is the soon to be expected album. One of the tracks, 'Such Is Life' the Sensation 2001 anthem, was released in july and climbed the charts with the speed of light. This track already differs from the style RANK 1 got famous with. And this will be continued on the forthcoming album on which Piet and Benno will demonstrate their variety, making it not just an album for the dancefloor but one to listen to at home as well.",

Today the main label is still running strong with over 40 vinyl releases and counting. Radial started out as a collaboration with Laurens van der Starre, but since 2009 it is Liebregts' solo project. \r\n\r\nAlways driven to dive deeper Jeroen started a 4-year studies of Sonology at the Conservatory in The Hague, which he finished in 2006. This study deals with electronic music composition, computer programming, analog synthesis and electronic instrument design among other things. This is probably what kickstarted his interest to use self designed instruments in his music. The constant quest for new technological approaches is an imported factor that helped shape his sound. His current tendency toward analog hardware based methods also resulted in his involvement in the design and development of the Synton Fenix modular synthesizer.\r\n\r\nOver the years the music of Jeroen Liebregts has found it's way to many places using different aliases. There have been releases of original tracks and remixes on labels such as Token, Perc-Trax, Mote-Evolver, Numb, Drumcode, Planet Rhythm, Dole-Gate and most recently Mord.",

His work so far, both in and outside the studio, has received praise from genre heavyweights like Richie Hawtin, Laurent Garnier and Paco Osuna.\r\n\r\nRed Square’s road has been an unconventional one. The thought of buying a set of turntables and getting into DJ-ing never occurred to him, and until this day still hasn’t. Instead, he invests all available time in studio-work and fully relies on his own productions when playing out live.\r\n\r\nBetween 2008 and 2012 a challenging period in his personal life left him physically exhausted. He was unable to make music and after finally recovering was forced to start over from square one. He did not go easy on himself; over the course of mere months his revived ambition lead to a string of releases on labels like KMS, Rhythm Convert(ed) and Different is Different.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the unasked-for ordeal drastically changed Red Square’s approach to making music. “Before, much of what I put out lacked soul. It was too rational, too constructed”, he says. That has changed, now depth and warmth best describe his tracks.\r\n  \r\nThose characteristics also translate to his live performance. A Red Square live-act is like spending time with him in his studio as he shapes and creates his sounds and builds one extended trip from them. The technical aspects of his live rig are set up in a way that grants him maximum on-the-spot freedom to alter his sounds as he goes. This in turn adds to the intensity of his performance. Feedback he receives during gigs is something he treasures; by capturing spontaneous moments, he is able to further build upon them back home.\r\n\r\nIn the past Red Square has played at a number of high-profile venues and events, including Tresor Club in Berlin, Doornroosje in Nijmegen and Slagthuset in Stockholm. He now has his internationally oriented sights set on growing his touring schedule with more gigs both at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nRed Square's music has received support from:\r\nRichie Hawtin, Laurent Garnier, Paco Osuna, Remy Unger, Tom Hades, Spark Taberner, Microtrauma , Estroe, Paul Hazendonk, Sam Paganini, Norman Nodge, Slam, Mattias Fridell, Dosem, Zoë Xenia, James Nidecker, Minilab, Steve Mulder, Ritzi Lee, Oliver Kucera, Drumcomplex, Paula Cazenave and many more.",

  "artist_bio": "Rawfare is the brainchild of a young producer hailing from Bratislava, a city known as the \"Detroit of East\" for its unique techno sound. Annoyed by genre cliches, he decided to ditch the pigeonhole game and started crafting his own vision of hard, energetic music with a signature twist. Being strongly influenced by the trashy sound that emerged in the Benelux region, a move to Amsterdam was soon in order.There the Rawfare project quickly caught the local scene's attention, resulting in four original EPs, numerous remixes and over 50 international performances played to date. \r\n\r\nHis stylistic boundaries are hard to pin down, varying the same way as the self-made third culture kid's chameleonic cultural background and influences. One common thread through the music is an affinity for highly polished noise and vibrant sparkles of distortion, interspersed with respectful nods towards the disruptive, thumping vibes of the early warehouse rave era and the contrarian attitudes of techno and punk. His melodies are playful and dangerous, reminiscent of an overzealous kid conquering a child safety lock in a moment that makes bored adults panic. Add that to the mountains of bass and drums fighting for the limelight and you have a singular blend that's difficult to keep quiet.",

  "artist_bio": "Experimental electronic music producer RAM IO grew up in the Netherlands during the 90’s. He spend his time as a DJ and producer of mainly hardcore and trance music, but he noticed his productions were moving towards techno every next song. RAM IO developed his own style based on repeating minimalistic grooves, deep atmospheres and often pounding kicks.Things developed in a new direction when he and Moss L teamed up as a DJ and live act in the summer of 2013. During their first year performing they have already shown they can handle every time slot playing at parties like ´Wunderbar invites Bla Bla´, ´Donders´, ´Ti Ta Techno´ and their own ´Tendens!´ events. Warming up or closing the night for names like Daniel Sanchez, Jan Liefhebber, Microvibez (live) and DJ Pure. Even though Silen was born the minute they agreed to bring their feeling on techno to the dance floor, it wasn´t until the beginning of 2015 that they adopted that name. They use the best of both worlds in their live set-up: DJ gear combined with hardware synthesizers, drum computer and mixers.\r\n\r\nRAM IO’s music delivery didn’t stop at the dancefloor as he started his label Mecanik records. Releases like ‘Fundamental’ and ‘Midnight feedback’ show what is RAM IO’s vision on delivering original techno with a little harder bite: dark, industrial and experimental.\r\n\r\nRAM IO will always be exploring the boundaries of electronic music and go beyond.\r\n\r\n- See more at: http://mecanikrecords.com/artist/ram-io/",

Raymond finished a track and needed a name to put it online. His sound then is heavily influenced by acts and band's like : The Chemical Brothers, Leftfield, Orbital. After putting several EP's online for free Raymond is picked up by Manual Music and releases his first vinyl release \"Warm Fuzzy Electronics\".\r\n\r\nLot's of remixes followed and Raymond played a lot of nice party's and festivals with his energetic live sets.

Since his teens has the Dutchman been in love with electronic music, and since then he has continued to hone his mixing skills and gain an ever increasing understanding of dance music, forever educating and impressing with his dexterous and coherent sets.\r\n\r\n“I get my inspiration as a DJ from the clubs, after parties, the people around me and DJs such as Optimo and Jamie Jones,” offers RAAF. “Besides just playing records, these guys add value to their sets with their great mixing.” Citing further inspirational sources as UK house outlets like Hypercolour, Hotflush Recordings, Losing Suki, Saints & Sonnets and Klasse Recordings. RAAF is known for his carefully curated DJ sets at places like AIR Amsterdam, Chicago Social Club and Club UP, as well as holding down a residency at one of the Netherlands’ foremost clubs in Studio 80, where he is a regular at nights Black Box and Voidd. \r\n\r\nTo catch the man in action is to be taken on a real musical trip, with deep house and the hybrid house of the UK being the current staples of his DJ diet. Not afraid to reach for a poppy hook, drop a sexy vocal or lay down some fulsome basslines, RAAF likes to hypnotise as well as educate, to entertain as well as inform the crowds to which he plays. \r\n\r\nMost recently RAAF has teamed up with fellow DJ and producer ABSURD for a new partnership that explores the deeper sides of the dancefloor. Their focus in the club is on raw music with texture and feeling as much as a purposeful drive, and the duo have similar ideals when they find themselves in the studio together, RAAF himself will be playing many festivals in summer 2013, including the monstrous Mysteryland, Straf_Werk and Amsterdam Open AIR.\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Growing up to a backdrop of deep house music, DJ and producer Prunk, was destined for a future behind the decks. His most memorable encounter with this sound is receiving an Ian Pooley record from his older brother on his 11th birthday. Of this moment he says: ‘’My brother already knew at that time that I could understand and feel house music. From that moment on, I fell in love with it’.A few years later Prunk started to mix records and dropped his first set on the internet. Sounds like Todd Terry, Moodymann, Dimitri from Paris and Blaze were pumping out of the speakers in his little attic.\r\nA the age of 16, Prunk found himself increasingly more attracted to deep and jackin’ sounds. The US house sound, particularly that of Mark Farina, was already one of his favourites, but he continued his search for the deeper and better beats the international house scene had to offer. His quest for this particular sound introduced him to artists like Kerri Chandler, Derrick Carter,Brett Johnson, Dixon and DJ Sneak.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, he started to do some producing himself. His first remix was of the The Stafford Brother’s track, ‘I Can See’. Just one week after completion, the remix caught the ear of Belgian Hed Kandi DJ, Tom De Neef, who subsequently played the track in his own Hed Kandi radio show, broadcast live on the net.\r\n\r\nTriggered by this success, Prunk decided to apply continued focus to his production work, with his tracks being picked up by Djs and radio shows from all over the world. Gig-wise this success has also meant a move to the big clubs and festivals within the Dutch house scene. He currently holds a residency at AIR Amsterdam and is making his debut at Mysteryland 2011 as well as playing other festivals throughout the season.\r\n\r\nHis production work is steaming ahead too - after releases on Soulman Records, summer 2011 sees the highly anticipated release of his new track ‘Do It Like Us’ on Bla Bla. With such a bright and busy future ahead of him, Prunk continues to embrace the music and source his inspiration from everyday life... even the rhythm of the the office air conditioner!",

Spinning records in the bedroom with a turntable that had no pitch bend and a minidisc was a hard start for them but after a while saving for proper equipment and seeing music in a different way ,It actually became a act, Ranz und Tanz dirty,deep and pumping. In 2006 Ranz und Tanz became residents at Die Lokomotive for once in a month, after playing a year. People recognized them and there preformances shook the crowd. That open some other doors for them and they were asked to play at more & bigger party's like Planet Rose, Cocoon, Rekorder and Vier. Traveling around brought them more friends,energie and joy in this: as they say '' community '' and wanted to make more part of this community. Now inspired by lots of fellow artists and audience the need to produce own records is bigger then ever....",

By getting their first recognition, Poze got not only the drive to produce more tracks but also to dig deeper and keep developing their sound onto warm and deep techno and house.\r\nIn 2012 things got better quite fast for Poze when Joris Voorn’s label “Rejected” released their remix of Ruben de Ronde’s track called “Stoer”. This remix was featured on several compilations and reached the “Beatport Tech House top 10”. Joris Voorn did it even call one of his secret weapons.\r\nFor Poze 2013 will be all about producing some new masterpieces, remixes and doing collaborations. Fabio Neural (ViVa music/Intec etc.) noticed Poze during summer and together they started to work on several tracks. Their collaboration resulted in the “Molivas EP”, which is released on “Intacto”.",

The Netherlands are lucky to add another great producer and live act to their list. Qindek’s first release made it far across the border last year.\r\n\r\nDarko Esser was the man who, again, pulled a new talent from the east of the country and gave him a shot at his own Wolfskuil-label to release music in vinyl. People like Rolando, Norman Nodge, Ben Sims and Âme incorporated Qindek’s release in their sets. The Outbreak EP(WOLF026) turned out to be a final breakthrough in  Qindeks career, who put his focus solely on techno 2 years ago.\r\n\r\nThe producer, who lives in Deventer, is in the music business for over ten years. In 2011 the urge of being an techno-only artist grew. This was a clear sign for himself: go back to the sole essence of electronic music. Qindek started the long journey with a new studio with the essential hardware.\r\n\r\nHis Amsterdam debut was in Trouw at the 21st of December 2013 at Sandrien's night Imprint. Next up is a gig with Psyk and Luke Slater at Reaktor.",

He practiced with 90’s loop-techno from countries like Slovenia, Sweden and Italy. When he had mastered his mixing techniques, there was a shift in techno music. This was of course the emergence of minimal. It took some time before Radiosus got a feeling with this sound, because the lack of energy was so different from the techno he grew up with. But it did not take long for minimal to merge with tech house and evolve to the more energetic techno played today, a style in which Radiosus is far more at home. \r\n\r\nRadiosus started mixing when his older brother, LoPoll, bought decks. When Radiosus learned how to play with the music as a dj, techno gained a new dimension for him. He started listening with a new ear, and his own style changed along, growing more refined. The music he liked had also changed; tracks had grown longer and their structures more complicated. So mixing with three decks proved more difficult than with traditional loop-techno. When he met his big friend Mind01 he was introduced to a new mixing style. Using the new A&H Xone92 and a soundbite loopbox, they practiced their new sound in Mind01’s old garden shed until sunrise. Their new mixing style and the technological advance in DJ equipment offered the possibility for a new approach to playing techno. Radiosus became a big fan of break building, where he uses loops to prolong the structure already in the tracks to maximize their climatic effects. These strong climaxes and long breaks characterize Radiosus’ present style. \r\nFrom this ability to control sound grew a desire to learn more about sound and such. Because of this, Radiosus recently started training as an audio-engineer.\r\n \r\n\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Deejay, mashup producer & collector hosting Funkafied with Ronny Hammond. Spinning sounds since the mid-80s, stood at the cradle of many styles in music but never sticked to one. Resident of HBR1 & montly host of Solta a Franga on dutch radiostation “Concertzender”. Rafadelic stands for a diversity of independent music and always plays truely unique sets on various events.Psychedelic Trance, Reggae, Funk, Indie, Chillout, Breakbeat, Jazz and Global Grooves... Rafadelic's been trippin deeply trough all sorts of music since he was young. Allready in the mid 80’s deejaying, singing, writing lyrics and eventually bounced many directions: Jamming with the likes of Hans Dulver (Paradiso Amsterdam), performing as ‘Treetop Unit’ (supporting De La Soul in Utrecht based Tivoli), released albums & 12 inches with King \"back by dope demand\" Bee' feat Rudeboy (Urban Dance Squad) and Kool Keith (Ultramagnetic MC’s) under the alter-ego 'Ragoo'. In the early 90s Rave, Madchester & Breakbeat became a fresh new passion and influence. \r\n\r\nAs he deejayed for seven years under the \"Oogar\" alias (Ragoo spelled backwards) with numorous other explorers (Buzz Fuzz, Dano, 100% Isis, Abraxas, Spider Willem) and became a voluntairy resident of the underground Leerdam-based club \"The Jungle\", so-called 'gabber' hit the spot in partyland a few years later. Within that shallow scene Rafadelic tried to keep the vibes deep & spiritual, with favourite recordlabels R&S, Harthouse, Planet Dog, Eye-Q and Rising High. Besides that he got more into early seventies jammusic and eventually Goa-Trance and Ambientmusic. Markpoints were the many Mindseye Squadparties in the dutch Betuwe-region - Ben’s Forrest Parties near the French border, Reggae-Sundance pre-parties in Eindhoven, The Artbag Tour with bands like Headmix and Celtica & shows including live-drums by Double-D (Now Motel Kingz) on cultural events. \r\n\r\nUp till today Raf's hosting “Funkafied” with DJ Ronny Hammond, breathing the kaleidoscopic early 70’s funk-jazz-disco atmosphere combined with the new Breakfunk sound of now. Raf Spinned a six hour ethnogroove set in a nonstop crowded tent at Folkfestival Dranouter and was a guest dj at some of the best dutch Trance-events (Nexus, Zirk, Cosmic Combination, Orkz, 4X4, Empathy, Namasté Arc of Goa). He was organiser and resident of the \"Spiral Sessions\" meetings with dutch progressive deejays from all over The Netherlands and of HBR1-Radio. \r\n\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Without doubt the hottest new trance DJ / producer to emerge from Holland this past year is Richard Durand. Recommended by the mighty Tiësto as his 'Tip For The Top in 2007' in DJ Magazine a year ago, Richard has responded with a string of stunning productions and remixes in recent months, including official reworks of Tiësto's 'Lethal Industry', 'Flight 643' and 'Break My Fall', Armin van Buuren's 'In And Out Of Love' plus a DJ diary that has exploded due to demand from high profile shows and festival appearances, culminating in Richard Durand rising to 66 in the DJ Magazine Top 100 poll in 2008.\r\nWithout doubt the hottest new trance DJ / producer to emerge from Holland this past year is Richard Durand. Recommended by the mighty Tiësto as his 'Tip For The Top in 2007' in DJ Magazine a year ago, Richard has responded with a string of stunning productions and remixes in recent months, including official reworks of Tiësto's 'Lethal Industry', 'Flight 643' and 'Break My Fall', Armin van Buuren's 'In And Out Of Love' plus a DJ diary that has exploded due to demand from high profile shows and festival appearances, culminating in Richard Durand rising to 66 in the DJ Magazine Top 100 poll in 2008.\r\n\r\nThe Richard Durand sound is trance, techno and tough electro in a unique package that's both dynamic and devastating. Having made his mark as a solo producer with the big tech trance bombs 'Make Me Scream' and 'Slipping Away' on the Terminal 4 label, the 2007 follow-ups 'Sweap And Repeat' and 'Submerge' and remixes of Tiesto vs BT 'Break My Fall' and Fragma 'Toca's Miracle' found playlist support from the biggest DJ names on the planet including as Paul van Dyk, Tiësto, Armin van Buuren, Ferry Corsten, Judge Jules and Eddie Halliwell to name but a few.\r\n\r\nHowever, what really sets Richard Durand apart from other leading producers are his exclusive and massively in demand reworks of big dance tunes from right across the dance spectrum. Once given a Richard rework, tracks such as Prodigy 'Smack My Bitch Up', Audio Bully's 'The Things', Snow Patrol 'Chasing Cars' and Binary Finary '1998' are brought bang up to date in a storming tech trance fusion. It’s a winning formula that’s been setting dancefloors on fire and making Richard Durand a buzz name.\r\n\r\nNot content with being one of the most in demand producers on the planet, Richard Durand is also one of the most technically accomplished DJs in dance music today. Utilising 4 x CD decks and effects units, his DJ sets are a whirlwind journey of cutting edge tunes, big samples, slick mixing and technical wizardry behind the decks. Add to the equation his undoubted ability to work a crowd into a frenzy and a clear passion about his music and the people in front of him on the dancefloor and you have all the right ingredients for a truly devastating DJ package and a legend in the making.\r\n\r\nThe proof of Richard Durand’s show-stopping sets and crowd pulling DJ status is confirmed by his DJ diary exploding. He’s performed at Dance Valley, Planet Love, Coloursfest, Revolution, RMI Trance Xplosion, Summer Of Love, Tunnel Electrocity and Dance Planet festivals around Europe, plus leading UK club brands such as Godskitchen, Gallery, Gatecrasher, Inside Out, Lush, Syndicate and Passion. Elsewhere around the globe he's rocked dancefloors from Melbourne to Mongolia and China to Canada this past year with the reactions from each new territory seemingly louder and more lively than the last!\r\n\r\nRichard Durand’s rapidly rising status is confirmed by his recent charting up 25 places to 66 in the 2008 DJ Magazine Top 100, a coveted Essential Mix on BBC Radio 1, the new single 'Weep' (feat. Skunk Anansie), remixes for Armin van Buuren 'In And Out Of Love' and Art Of Trance 'Madagascar', plus a standout summer residency at Judgement Sundays in Ibiza.",

The Dutchman has blown the doors wide open with 2 huge releases on Toolrooom Records. “Like It Deep and “Big” have spent a total of two and half months at the top of the Beatport Tech House chart, and over 5 in the top 10 overall. This has included massive support from Mark Knight, Sander Kleinenberg, Groove Armada, Fatboy Slim, Technasia and many more. No mean feat at all, but if you listen to the consistency of his productions, it’s not hard to understand why he is one of this years’ biggest sellers.\r\n\r\nAs a result, demand for him in the club has never been bigger. Punters from around the world are clamouring to see the Dutchman live, with tours planned in the US, the Far East as well as jaunts to keep the home fires burning in Europe.\r\nFew people have displayed the disciplined approach to producing that Rene Amesz has in the last few years. Churning out a steady stream of his unique, dirty cuts with their own distinctive groove, Amesz now has a sound that has been destroying speakers all over the world. It is now coming into its own at just the right time, still as fresh as ever, still evolving ever since he started to tailor his percussive sound for the dance floor. He has without doubt marked himself out as being one of the pioneers of his sound.\r\n\r\nCareer highlights have seen him take on remixes for Mark Knight and Funkagenda’s “The Man with the Red Face” and with further huge releases on Rising, Spinning Deep, and Sander Kleinenberg’s This Is imprint, this producer has certainly made his mark many times over.\r\n\r\nWith collaborations coming with Mark Knight and Mendo and labels clamouring for fresh cuts from the great man, 2015 will continue to be another incredible year for the man from Rotterdam.",

Rishi Bass started spinning hip-hop, R&B and soul in 1990 but not for long as he got ‘infected’ by the house music virus in the early nineties. Like every other hard working dj back in the day, he spent a couple of years spinning anywhere and everywhere, working the field, till his big break finally arrived as Rishi was asked to do a club mix for New Dance Radio (1996).\r\n\r\nHis skills didn’t go unnoticed. The very first booking at legendary RoXY Amsterdam (as a warm up dj for Groovemaster Johnson) was a fact, followed by a Sunday residency at RoXY’s famous G-Lounge parties.\r\n\r\nSoon he became a household name in the Dutch UK/US garage scene, voted #3 best Garage DJ in 1998. The garage period came to its natural ending though when in the late nineties Rishi decided to focus on tribal & latin house. His first release in 1999 (The Defect E.P.) was a commercial success, big enough to put Rishi Bass on the international map; the follow up track was a release together with DJ Roog and Greg from Hardsoul.\r\n\r\nDuring the next couple of years he kept gigging all over the place. It looked as if he could be at multiple locations at the same time as his name could be found on almost every bill of every major club and/or party in existence. In Holland and Europe!\r\n\r\nHis productions grew stronger with every new release and when in 2003 his track “Peak Compression” was picked up by Pete Tong in the BBC Radio 1 show, it seemed nothing could stand in the way of this talented dj/producer. But Rishi Bass wouldn’t be the man he is today if he just did what we all expect him to do, so instead of riding out the success of Peak Compression he decided to chill for a while.\r\n\r\nAfter a short break in 2004 Mr Bass came back, stronger than ever, and he’s been unstoppable ever since!\r\n\r\nGigging , producing, collaborating with other talented folks within the Dutch and international house scene: Rishi is definitely back on track. Literally. In 2006 he releases three vinyl productions: two with D-Rashid (La Fexa and Raw! on Big Boss Records) and Shake on the label of Gregor Salto, G-Rex. Many more successful productions followed: ‘Casera’ with Mc Stretch, ‘Get Ready’ with Mitch Crown, ‘Monkey say, monkey do’ and ‘Why?’ with Melly Mel.\r\n\r\nWith more than 40 official releases and over 15 years of experience, his uplifting sets and ability to rock every crowd Rishi Bass is definitely a name to watch out for.",

Jean was impressed by Rick Charles’ skills and it wasn't long before DJ Jean asked Rick to take over the wheels of steel on Fridays at the IT Club. This allowed his career to sky rocket, most markedly so after playing a set at the famous radio station 'Radio 538'. He performed at many clubs and events and played with some of the biggest DJs, to name a few; Tiesto, Klubbheads, DJ Jean, Rank 1, Johan Gielen, Erick-E.\r\n\r\nIn 2001 Rick Charles made a big change in his style of music and followed his heart. He gave up the opportunity of a commercial breakthrough and instead put his passion and emotion into Techno music. Beside DJing, he also began dedicating more time to producing records. Many of his own productions and remixes were released onto well known compilation CDs. In 2003 he participated at a famous Techno DJ contest in Amsterdam called 'Twstd', which he won - a great boost for his career as a Techno/Minimal/House DJ. This was followed by many more appearances at some of the biggest indoor and outdoor events and clubs in Holland and abroad: Rotterdam alongside Tiesto, Kai Tracid, Erick-E (organiser ID&T), 'Trance Energy', The Hague alongside Marco V, Rank 1, Klubbheads (organiser ID&T), 'Innercity', Amsterdam Line-up: Ken Ishi, Tiesto, Carl Cox (organiser ID&T) 'Impulz Festival's, Hertogenbosch Carl Cox, Michel de Hey (organiser UDC); 'Twstd' stage, Queens day Amsterdam Audio Bully’s , Oscar Mulero, Joel Mull.\r\n\r\nIn 2007 Rick Charles became a dad and wanted to create a stable home for his two sons. This did however mean that his DJing and producing career was to be put on a slight back burner. However, by 2009 Rick Charles made a return to the scene and decided to rekindle his DJing career. It wasn't long before he was approached for demos of his work, and consequently he was signed to the UK label, Plastik Philosophy in the Autumn of 2009.

  "artist_bio": "Rick Dyno began his DJ ventures in the end of 80′s (in 2015 he will celebrate his 25 years anniversary) with Gabber music. At first he was known as Dino, and changed it later to Dyno. The whole decade of the 90′s he successfully played in various clubs in Holland and Germany spinning mainly the harder music styles (Hardcore and Hardstyle).In 2008, after a 1.5 year search for a new style to play, he came across Tech House. This was the music style he was looking for because some of these tracks in this genre gave him goosebumps. This is why he introduced Tech House to his catalog and later even added Techno and Minimal to it. The impact of this change was imminent. He has since that moment played in numerous venues and festivals from UK (Vale Earth Fair, Guernsey) to Holland (ADE, Amsterdam) to Ibiza (V Club) to Germany, back to Holland and many more in between.\r\n\r\nHe also has a popular YouTube channel and adds a new live mix every month.\r\n\r\nIn 2011 he came in contact with 7 Stars Music, a record label from Amsterdam. For this label he played on his first ADE (Amsterdam Dance Event) gig. After this successful party, he signed with the label. Since signing with 7 Stars Music, Rick Dyno was the resident of the Close Connection parties in various clubs in Amsterdam that unfortunately had to come to an end.\r\n\r\nBecause it is essential for DJ's nowadays to gain more exposure, he started to search for more information about producing. With a lot of help from his good friend Volt9, he mastered the DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) called Ableton. While still learning, Rick Dyno (because there already was a producer called Dyno, he added his real name to his artist name) released his first track in 2012 on 7 Stars Music. Today he spends a lot of hours in his studio to make the perfect dancefloor filler!!\r\n\r\nExpect to hear more of RICK DYNO in the future!!!!!!!",

Influenced by Ricardo Villalobos he discovered the more housey and deeper tunes. Nowadays he likes to play old gems together with brand new stuff and he is always searching for undiscovered bombs. Rik is a big fan of longer sets, especially in the morning hours. That’s why Rik has earned his credits as the organizer of the well-known Voltt after parties in the Supperclub. Those who have been there know the crazy mornings at numerous locations in Amsterdam.\r\nSwing, swing, swing, is all we can do when Rik gets in control behind the decks. He should be seen as an artist who understands the new direction of house and how it can be used to create a good and outgoing atmosphere on the dance floor. Rik is busy learning the tricks of producing music. So hopefully in the future we will hear his tunes on the dancefloor.\r\n",

Exceptional dance music, whatever its genre, may be thought of as an exceptional expression of the artist’s soul. Exceptional mixing, consequently, may be thought of as an exceptional expression by the DJ in understanding and conveying the ultimate dance records, thus doing justice to the original artists’ intentions. In my opinion, Robbert Z. is one of the few present day DJs who has actually mastered this crucial DJ-ing skill. \r\n\r\nHaving known Robbert Z. for almost a decade now, I have been in the privileged position of watching his musical abilities mature. Musically speaking, Robbert Z.’s childhood was very much inspired by his father (a former hippy), which led to a great and valuable appreciation of bands and artists like, amongst others, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, and Pink Floyd. During adolescence, his musical orientation was aimed at bands like Nirvana and Rage Against the Machine. It wasn’t until his days at the Amsterdam School of the Arts that Robbert Z. came across – and came to appreciate – dance music.\r\n\r\nRobbert Z.’s initial broad interest in dance music, which was further ignited by several jobs in the record industry, featured varying dance styles: drum ‘n’ bass, techno, electro, et cetera. This broad outlook on music would develop into both a deep fascination and great appreciation for techno oriented dance music, including styles like electro, minimal, progressive, and tech-house. Indeed, Robbert Z. is at his best when manoeuvring through these related yet characteristic variations on techno.  \r\n\r\nBeing well-known with techno in general, and Robbert Z.’s mixing abilities in particular, I feel no need to be reserved when stating that Robbert Z.’s mixing abilities are one of a kind. His great sensation of music at the one hand, and his energetic and charismatic performance on the other, result in a style of mixing that does justice to both the rock and blues that is to be found in every good dance record. Indeed, Robbert Z. is exceptionally able in preserving the soul of techno, and sharing it with his ever-thrilled audience.\r\n\r\nMarc D. Bahlmann\r\nJanuary 2, 2007",

Travelling all over the world got him in touch with so many different kind of cultures and styles of music which made him the artist who he is today. Taking his time to find his own style, made it his and still craving for more. He likes to bring something for those who love to dream as well for them who stay on the dancefloor all night.\r\n\r\nThis is Rik Watts, with his Dutch sober, ‘act normal than you act crazy enough’ mentality. Hard working and stay true to yourself but still loving to share his musical thoughts with others and most of all make them into an artistic reality. \r\n\r\nHis love for music stems from hearing soul, funk and hip hop at home with some Indonesian culture provided by his girlfriend were it all falls down on being ‘senang’ (feeling good).

After five or six years of producing\r\nHip-Hop beats for local rappers he decided to change course and fully focus one the Electronic Dance Music (EDM) genre. First just expirimental,\r\nminimal bleeps but as soon as he found his niche he took all his gained knowledge and inspiration to turn it into grooving Tech House and Deep House\r\nproductions that will definitely stimulate you to make your way to the dancefloor. \r\nRicardos Raphie also isn't averse to other styles in music such as Frenchcore (along with Dr. Peacock) and Dubstep. Even though these side projects \r\nevoked a lot of positive feedback, he still wanted to follow his heart and kept on giving the Tech House and Deep House heads what they want.\r\nRicardos Raphie released a couple of tracks through various labels so the people started to get a taste of what he is capable of on an\r\ninternational level.\r\n\r\nOne thing lead to another. Taking place behind the turntables was just a logical follow-up. That way he can introduce more people to the result of his \r\nhard work he did in the (home) studio. Many visitors of different venues and festivals have now experienced the energy of his entertaining live-act.\r\nRicardos Raphie is also the organizer of the succesful events 'Dagelijkse Kost' and 'Grijsdraaiers'. \r\n\r\n\"There's nothing like a packed venue with people that came to enjoy a clubnight that has been set up by yourself\", he says.\r\n\r\nThe production fase in the (home) studio suits him best though. Surrounded by knobs and switches. Creating his own reality for a moment to \r\nfinally result in another banging Ricardos Raphie production!",

  "artist_bio": "Discovered composing electronic music in 2000 and seriously producing since 2008.Rob 'Belleville' van Beek is a true enthusiast of music in all its possible forms and styles, as long as it contains soul and passion. He is born at home in a hot summer in Soest, a village 50 km southeast from Amsterdam. Music was a daily issue in the family he grew up. Rob's sister has been playing piano since her teenage years. His dad likes to play guitar since he is a small kid and he has also been singing in a local choir for fifteen years. His dancing mother is born in Surabaya and is therefore responsible for Rob's Indonesian roots. Rob came in touch with electronic dance music when he was once listening to the legendary Dutch radio show 'For Those Who Like To Groove'. Among dj's that were invited in this show, were Richie Hawtin, Orlando Voorn, Miss Djax and Speedy J. From that special moment the incredibly strong love for electronic music started. He bought his first records when he was 19, focusing on releases from established techno labels like F-Communications, Djax-Up-Beats, Chain Reaction, Kanzleramt and NovaMute. He spent many hours in record shops all over the Netherlands to search for records that could not be missed in his vinyl collection. It didn't take long before he bought two Technics turntables and a Numark mixer to develop his mixing skills. After 3 years of home recordings on cassette and MiniDisc, his vinylmania stopped. Rob's interest for the composing aspect of electronic music, pushed him to buy a Korg ER-1 drumcomputer. Experimenting with this piece of hardware motivated him to expand his 'home studio' and to develop his musical hobby in the first decade of this 21st century. One of his first works was released on a cd which was included in \"Future Music\". Four of his early works have also been reviewed in this magazine about music technology. A few years later Dutch label Essential Dance Music digitally released a promo album under his alias Artilect. In 2008 some of Rob's tunes were discovered by British techno veteran Paul Souter aka Paul Mac. This resulted in a release on Paul's own digital label Sula Muse Recordings, which is now defunct..In 2010 Rob had his first release on vinyl on the Dutch techno label aDepth audio.",

After long searching what his sound was gonna be he heard DJ sets from DJ's like Sneak, Gene Farris and Derrick Carter and then he knew: that is my sound, the Chicago House. A funky and bumping house sound from America.\r\n\r\nWithin a year he already played for public. It didn't take long when RENE RECHE was a known DJ in his area, because in 2007 he won the biggest DJ contest in his state. And then the big party's came. He spinned on festivals like Extrema Outdoor (NL, capacity 60.000), Solar Weekend Festival (NL, capacity 30.000), Free Funk Festival (NL, capacity 25.000) and in bigger clubs like Paradiso (Amsterdam), Escape (Amsterdam), The Mansion (Amsterdam), Club Up (Amsterdam), Club Home (Amsterdam), Club Rembrandt (Eindhoven), De Rechter (Eindhoven) and in the Bozzini (Kerkrade).\r\n\r\nIn that period he played alongside some big names in the industry like: Ron Carol (USA), Joey Youngman/Wolfgang Gartner (USA), DJ Mes (USA), Milton Jackson (UK), Marcus Worgull (GER), Inland Knights (UK), Dr. Lektroluv (BE), Roman Salzger (GER), Laidback Luke (NL), Benny Rodrigues (NL), Roog (NL), Afrojack (NL), Bart B More (NL), René Amesz (NL), Hardwell (NL), Eric Da Man (NL), Luciën Foort (NL) en Funkerman (NL).\r\n\r\nAt the end of 2008 RENE RECHE was improving his sound, he was also interested in the darker side of house music. His interests went out to deephouse, house and techhouse. Artists like Jimpster, Âme, Dixon, Deetron, Henrik Schwarz, Milton Jackson, Josh Wink, Joris Voorn, Solomun, Maceo Plex. Since then RENE RECHE stopped DJ'ing the Chicago House sound and begin spinning deephouse music.\r\n\r\nRENE RECHE is also a promoter for partys. Since 2008 he joined the Soulfully Yours community, an underground Chicago House organisation that had in 2011 his 10th birthday. But in the end of 2011 he started his own concept: taferelen. A party for deephouse and house music.",

Robaco's love for music started at the early age of 11 as a drummer, however, having discovered house music in his teens, the young man started to combine and create his own beats with other instruments. Robaco’s early DJ sets saw him mix up deep, progressive, tech and minimal house, stirred up with a lot of groovy and funky elements. He got the recognition he deserved when he was chosen to perform at some major clubs in The Netherlands..\r\n\r\nThings got even better for Robaco in the beginning of 2009 when he got his first record deal, with his first release ‘Bounce It Up’ appearing on Roger Sanchez's ‘Release Yourself’ radio show, and subsequently a worldwide audience. His next releases followed suit and his sounds were receiving support from established names in the international dance scene such as Roger Sanchez, The Shapeshifters, Chocolate Puma, David Penn, Laidback Luke, Housequake (DJ Roog & Erick E), DJ Chuckie, Baggi Begovic, Gregor Salto and Youri Donatz to name a few.. \r\n\r\nAlong with his successful Defected track ‘Black Bird’, he has also won a DJ competition in the area of Utrecht (Netherlands) and conquered a residency at the SLAM!Cafe, hosted by the famous dutch radio station SLAM!FM. He did remix work for Chocolate Puma’s (Zki & Dobre) imprint ‘Pssst Music Recordings’ and other major releases by Baggi Begovic & Groovenatics, Youri Donatz, Josh The Funky1 , Dreamcity and Dos Palomas Negras, which gave him an internationally recognized name in the dance scene. \r\n\r\nA new album and several remixes are just a small part of all future plans by Robaco. His own label ‘Bossa Records’ will become reality in 2013 and some other big projects will be announced in the near future. \r\n\r\nIt is a sure bet that the name Robaco Bossa will continue to grow.",

And the most funny thing, this went across the globe. At some point RSTRCTD had brazilian groupies.\r\n\r\nNowadays, the Live webcasts are joined with VJ visuals and sent to our watching listeners. People can also join in on our chat, where RSTRCTD tries to chat and catchup with our regulars.\r\n\r\nRSTRCTD tries to do this monthly basis. Mainly Saturday nights targeted starttime between 11 and 12 PM CET.\r\n\r\nKeep a close watch on RSTRCTDs facebook page or twitter account, as that RSTRCTD tries to make announcements as early as possible.\r\nThis usually means that announcements can be made on the day itself.",

  "artist_bio": "Rene Engel is a name that has risen from the underground to the bigger stages. From illegal warehouse raves to many Festivals, Rene knows how to please the crowd with his unique choice of records. He is inspired by funk, soul and jazz, and these influences find their groovy way into his set which range from deep house to techno. More is to come soon, as Rene is working on an EP for Spanish label Sincopat with Kid Culture with remixes from hero's like X- Press 2 & AFFKT.It is without a doubt that funk, hiphop soul and jazz have kept Rene Engel enthusiastic being a music lover and artist for years. The old school Detroit house scene certainly has his constant attention as well. From the more obscure and unknown gems he discovers, to the more well-known artists in these genres: they make him tick. It is the borderless love and passion for special music, filled with the sound of yesterday which Rene translates effortless to contemporary dance floors. “I feel it as my duty to translate the special feeling I get from this music to my djsets.” Gigs at Paradiso, Poema, Indian Summer Festival, 18hrs Festival, Woodstock 69, Stalker, 12 Inch City and Gramdioos all reflect this. The raging crowd at his closing set on Queensday is the best example, Rene says. “Closing after Gabriel Ananda and taking a mere five thousand people on my musical journey, is priceless.”\r\n\r\nThe first release Rene Engel did was a collab with Kid Culture and was released on Amsterdam based Bitten Records. This 2000 and One and Sandy Huner label gave wings to the release, which got support by Karotte, Dubfire, Deetron and Hermanez, to name a few. June 2012 another collab with Kid Culture was released. “He means true inspiration to me. Without him the Visions EP never existed.” The track was released by Sincopat, with remix work by X-Press2 and AFFKT. Studio work continues and more and more people are interested in what is next for Rene Engel. He is convinced it’s his job to make sure the expectations get fulfilled. “I aim pretty high. Think Nuno Dos Santos his record choice and dynamic sets. Think the way an artist like Dixon makes a night from head to toe.”",

His proven craftsmanship leads to true pièces de résistance, both in his live sets as in his tracks, which are often demure, yet fierce floorbangers. Serious music, accompanied with a subtle smile.\r\n\r\nRobin performed live at TrouwAmsterdam, Palais de Tokyo in Paris, Tresor in Berlin, Paradigm in Groningen, the Fusion festival in Germany and at different venues in Kuala Lumpur, to name a few highlights. \r\n\r\nAt the end of 2014 Robin Kampschoer delivered a seven track EP with his dub/ambient/soundscape moniker RMFK, released on Redevice Recordings.

In just seven years he’s clocked up more dance floor destroyers, sell out gigs and awards than most artists do in a lifetime… and his journey is still in its infancy.First there were Heineken and Edam, then came Sander van Doorn.  The Dutch musical genius may not be as mature as his predecessors but he’s certainly made as much of an impact in his comparatively short career, not only in The Netherlands but also across the world.\r\n\r\nHaving made his debut in the world renowned DJ Mag Top 100 at 32 in 2006, before climbing 19 places to No.13 in 2008’s poll; sandwiched between Carl Cox and Paul Oakenfold, the fast rise of Sander van Doorn is a testament to his raw talent and dedication. In just seven years he’s clocked up more dance floor destroyers, sell out gigs and awards than most artists do in a lifetime… and his journey is still in its infancy. \r\n\r\nFrom the start Sander (and his alter egos; Sam Sharp, Purple Haze, Filterfunk & Sandler) has produced a variety of sounds at a level that only most producers can dream of, combining elements of trance, electro, techno and house constantly blowing away his fans and comrades, keeping everyone guessing what he’s going to come up with next. His debut artist album ‘Supernaturalistic’ was released in 2008 to rave reviews and launched a 32 date global album tour. He followed this by winning the coveted prize of ‘Best Breakthrough Artist’ at WMC’s IDMA, where he also received a nomination for ‘Best Underground Track’ with ‘Riff’.\r\n\r\nIt’s not only Sander’s solo productions that keep everyone on their toes but his bootlegs, covers and incredible remixes. This year we have seen Sander deliver official interpretations for multi-million selling and multi-award winning band, The Killers, with his re-working of their single ‘Spaceman’, as well as ‘Peace’, the new single from electronic legends Depeche Mode.  \r\n\r\nAlso let’s not forget his fantastic selection of collaborations, with artists including friend and mentor Marco V on the monster tracks ‘Organic’ and ‘What Say’, and ‘Close My Eyes’, the European Top 20 hit, with a man that needs no introduction, Robbie Williams. Sander is one of the most in-demand genre crossing producers of his generation, his releases regularly picking up support from as wide reaching places as Pete Tong, Judge Jules, Tiesto and Carl Cox – you’re as likely to find his records in a house DJ’s box as a trance DJs. \r\n\r\nNot content with taking the world by storm with his productions, Sander’s DJ skills are a force to be reckoned with. Every year sees Sander playing to over one million clubbers. He consistently headlines huge events from Sensation to Global Gathering, from Trance Energy and Mysteryland through to his high profile summer residency at Cream in Ibiza.  \r\n\r\nIt was Sander’s DJing experiences around the world that prompted him to start up ‘Dusk Till Doorn’, taking clubbing to the next level, offering the ultimate Sander van Doorn experience.. Having already wowed crowds at the launch in May at The Gallery, Ministry of Sound, London and in Ibiza in June, Sander’s musical and visual journey continues to pleasure crowds around the globe. \r\n\r\nSander is extremely grateful to his fans and likes to give back as much possible.  In 2006 Sander set up his own radio show, giving fans the opportunity to hear him no matter where they might be. Now in it’s 3rd year and broadcast on DI.FM and syncidacted globally, the show has given Sander a platform to distribute the sound thousands of fans adore and a stage to test his own productions.  In 2009 Sander relaunched www.sandervandoorn.com offering users the chance to view his Studio Sessions videos, learning the tricks of his trade, as well as being able to listen to his entire discography. The updated site includes the SvD forum, SvD shop, guestbook, his monthly hour long DJ mix and an exclusive members section which offers exclusive bonus content. \r\n\r\nWith all the above happening at such an early stage for Sander, it’s easy to see where this man’s career is heading – No.1 \r\n\r\nWebsite: http://www.sandervandoorn.com\r\nMyspace: http://www.myspace.com/sandervandoorn.com\r\nDusk Till Doorn: http://www.dusktilldoorn.com\r\nYou Tube: http://www.youtube.com/sandervandoorntv\r\nFacebook Group: http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=11087682391\r\nFacebook Fan Page: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sander-van-Doorn/42400315644?ref=ts\r\nBebo: http://www.bebo.com/SanderVanDoorn\r\n\r\n",

Because of his strong developed musical knowledge and inspiration by family, he started making his own mixtapes. When Roy turned fourteen years old he began with dj'ing and bought his first turntables and mixer with all of his saving money.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFrom that day on, this deejay is hooked on house music and constantly looking for the best records to put in his sets. Wherever he goes, there's always music with, and around him. That is also what the website is based on.. Wherever he goes, Whatever he does.. there's always music around him. The last two years he found his roots in the mix of soulful house, deephouse and minimal. At the moment Rové is the resident dj at the biggest Beachclub in Europe: Beachclub Vroeger at Bloemendaal, which can hold over 5500 party people. Some clubs he has spinned at over the years are: The Mansion, The Sand, Melkweg, Westerunie and Outdoor Stereo.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHis biggest inspiration and motivation comes from : Dj Sneak, Kerri Chandler, Maceo Plex, Kabale und Liebe and Matthias Tanzmann.",

  "artist_bio": "Saam (real name Sam Vermeer) is a Techno DJ / Producer / Live act from the Netherlands. He grew up living in a small town called Koedijk (near Alkmaar). At age seven he started playing the guitar and quickly developed further musical interest. So, at age 13, Saam started DJing. He bought two turntables and a mixer and started taking weekly DJ lessons. In the beginning Saam played vinyl only, but after three years he started to play cd’s as well. At this moment he started to get familiar with Techno tracks and started to develop his own style.From this moment, Saam also began to produce his own tracks in Ableton Live. He produced his first Techno tracks in 2012, which led to multiple EP releases on labels like Wall Music (Mike Wall’s imprint). In 2015 Saam released his second album, also on the Berlin-based label Wall Music.\r\n Saam gets his inspiration from various analog synthesizers and drum computers, like the Roland TR-909 and the Roland SH-101. Nowadays he has a studio in Amsterdam, where he has his own collection of analog equipment. With this hardware, he creates his dark, whipping, tripping, Berlin style cuts.\r\n\r\n2013 was the year when Saam started to perform live acts. In these live sets he exclusively uses his own tracks or remixes by himself. This act contains live drum computers, loads of MIDI controllers and more outboard equipment. This way Saam has a lot more to do on stage, as well as it allows him to have a better interaction with the crowd.\r\n\r\nHis production receive massive support from some great artists like Chris Liebing, DVS1, Joseph Capriati, Paco Osuna, Mike Wall, Dr. Motte and more. This support eventually led to some interesting gigs at events like Schönes Wochenende and clubs like Studio 80 and Paradiso.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 2015 Saam joined the Ravage agency and label. His diverse style of music suits the labels diverse techno sound perfectly. We are proud to be able to help develop and represent this amazing young talent.",

  "artist_bio": "From deep atmospheric soundtrack acid to dark industrial electro-funk and melancholic electronic wave disco, Rude 66 has done it with a Dystopian edge of new wave-futurism.From deep atmospheric soundtrack acid to dark industrial electro-funk and melancholic electronic wave disco, Rude 66 has done it with a Dystopian edge of new wave-futurism. \r\n\r\nVia noise and EBM in the 80's, Rude 66 landed on Bunker Records in 1993 where, with Unit Moebius and I-f, he defined the acid sound of The Hague: lo-fi acid from the sewer. In 1997 Rude 66, bored with corporate techno and empty distorted acid, evolved his style to dark electro funk.\r\nA string of EP’s on leading genre labels like Bunker, Vynalogica, Angelmaker, Crème organisation and Viewlexx established Rude’s name as one of the masters of the dark side of electro-wave and acid, pushing his analogue studio to the limits on already classic tracks like Machine, Black Sabbath, My 909, Overkill, The 1000 year storm, As and the Sadistic Tendencies album.. Rude’s latest release is a 2LP of mostly unreleased archive material from 1992-1998 on Crème.\r\n\r\nNew upcoming releases include a split 7” with US shoegaze band Screen Vinyl image, several remixes and brand new material which leaved the electro trail and veers into slow dark acid territory.\r\n\r\nFor the past 15 years, Rude has perfected a sound that employs everything from early 80’s alternative club music to his own dark acid past, from oldskool electro to Italian soundtracks. Rude’s choice of workhorses (mostly vintage analogue synths and drum machines) and recording methods (still using a big mixing desk and analogue reel-to-reel recording) have resulted in an instantly recognizable signature sound: hard, dense but full of detail and groove and still carrying trace elements of the classic sound of The Hague.\r\nAs a firm believer in only recording tracks when you have something to say, Rude’s output has never been prolific, but each release has hit the scene hard. Rather than just making tracks for the sake of making tracks, Rude’s music has always had an idea behind it, usually working with themes rooted in the darker side of life. \r\nRude’s tracks have been used, abused, charted and compiled by dj’s like Dave Clarke, Andrew Weatherall, The Hacker, Miss kitten, I-f, Sven Vath and countless others, though his tracks are anything but dj-tracks only made to fill mixes. To Rude it’s very important that his tracks can be enjoyed at home as much as on the dance floor.\r\n\r\nHis signature sound has been applied to a number of remixes for other artists. Rude has run the Vynalogica label for the CEM studio in Amsterdam and  his own weekly radio show at I-f’s Intergalactic FM internet radio station called Cosmic Overdrive. Rude is also a member of the 303 Allstars, a live acid collaboration with Cosmic Force, the Acid Junkies, Zero One and Drifter. \r\nAs a mastering engineer, Rude specializes in vinyl mastering for underground labels, either giving modern tracks the sound of the early 80’s or moulding vintage material into something ready for vinyl.\r\n\r\nRude 66's acclaimed live shows are intense improvisation workouts featuring mostly analogue equipment. They include live vocals by Rude’s wife Shaunna, and are based loosely on the studio tracks. Rude has dragged his equipment all across the world for over 15 years from small squats to big festivals, and knows like no other how to rock a crowd hard.\r\n\r\nBilled 'the king of the dark electro-wave death race' by slick promoters, Rude likes his tracks to sound like you're on the red carpet pathway to hell. Dancing.\r\n",

Joining a new and unassailable breed of intrinsically driven minimal house and deep tech producers, Roon is rising gradually and reassuringly throughout the ranks of Europe’s future generation of underground electronic musicians.\r\n\r\nHailing from the picturesque city of Haarlem, just outside of Amsterdam, 24 year old Roon portrays all the hallmarks of a musical prodigy in the making. That said, it’s no surprise then that he has already performed at some of the world’s most revered underground clubs and parties, including both Sankeys Ibiza and New York, Studio 80 in Amsterdam, Rotterdam ‘s Toffler Club, Chalet in Berlin, Barcelona’s OFF Week and Kiesgrube in Germany.\r\n\r\nWhilst he still remains in the infancy of what promises to be an exciting and illustrious career in the industry, Roon has already drawn attention from one of London’s leading underground parties and label imprints, ‘Fuse’. With his latest collaboration with Pelle called ‘Gida’, released on Fuse’s sub-label ‘Infuse’ in 2014, Roon has entered the production market as he means to go-on with future releases on Randall M’s label Thirteen and Dutch imprint Karton, clearly illustrating that he possesses the necessary minerals to ‘mix-it’ with the very best.\r\n\r\nDescribing his refined sound as ‘a fusion of minimalistic, atmospheric and thought provoking grooves’, Roon also claims two solid tracks produced together with Pelle under his belt ‘Dor’ and ‘Feel Like’, which were released on ‘Moral Fiber Records’ and ‘Dorcas Records’ VA’s in 2012 and 2013 respectively. These early productions both enjoyed full support from Roon’s personal inspirations tINI, Enzo Siragusa, Seb Zito Yaya and Rich NxT, and are still navigating their way onto many a credible playlist to this very day.\r\n\r\nAn official member of Amsterdam based label ‘Karton’, Roon has also become a regular fixture on the label’s showcases since its inception in 2011. Forging a close friendship with label owners Pelle (Draft Records/Baile Musik/Earlydub Records) and David van Bilderbeek, this affiliation has definitely aided ‘Roon’ with his maturity and evolution as both a rounded DJ and budding producer. Further influenced by the persuasive sounds of ‘Perlon’, ‘Minibar’, and Dutch label ‘Dialegestai Music’, the foundations have been firmly laid in place for this determined, diligent and sincere artist to progress onto the next phase of his musical conquest, as 2015 will bring more of Roon’s evolved Dutch sound in form of various releases, as well as gigs at influential events like High Definition Festival in London.",

Besides spinning at memorable parties and some of the  best festivals, RuÃ«ll is a well experienced organizer of several House events and has  mind-blowing productions lined up for release. With his boosting energy reflecting on his ongoing career, RuÃ«ll is focused on putting his extraordinary mark on the international music industry.\r\n\r\nLOVING TO RELEASE THE HOUSE\r\nStarting out as an event organizer in 2007, RuÃ«ll still proudly presents his concepts \"STOUT\" and \"Release the House\" on a frequent base. While  he first made sure great talents rocked the DJ decks and the crowd enjoyed every minute of it, RuÃ«ll never expected on how this would get another ball rolling. Inspired by the deejays he booked for his events in a night club in Groningen (Holland), RuÃ«ll devoted all his spare time taking lessons and spend his money on professional gear. This same club happily gave him the opportunity to practice his skills during the day and soon enough he would be warming up the crowd with his sound. To this day he not only maintains a successful DJ residency in this club but also enjoys playing sets for some of the biggest events on a global scale.\r\n\r\nSET & SOUNDS \r\nRecognized by his mature sound and loved for representing his passion behind the wheels of steel, RuÃ«ll is set to keep capturing his audience. With his big smile and limitless view on how to get any party started, he plays a various style of House music. From deep House beats to edgy Techno sounds and forging a perfect balance of all the progressive styles in between.\r\nBesides taking club nights and festivals to a higher level, RuÃ«ll also developed a real hunger to create music in the studio. From huge collaborations, with RenÃ© Amesz, Lucien Foort and Roberto da Costa, to proudly releasing his own productions. In 2011 RuÃ«ll releases \"Sticky Fingers\" with RenÃ© Amesz on one of the biggest world-leading labels from the music industry Toolroom Records. The collaboration with RenÃ© turns out to be a success and recently they released \"Hope\" on the Toolroom label, which got included on the Miami Compilation 2012 album.\r\n\r\nWith many more productions to be released within the following months this is definitely a DJ to watch. Ready to take over the international dance industry and giving you the best clubbing experience while doing so, RuÃ«ll is determined to lose sight of the shore by discovering new oceans in a world of House.",

  "artist_bio": "Superstar Dutch DJ and producer Sander Kleinenberg has built his international reputation on an ability to create different atmospheres, for myriad crowds, at venues all over the world.Kleinenberg is not only an artist who declines to stick to a single, easily defined sound, he also utilizes more than one medium to create a night out.  Long at the forefront of integrating video imagery and other visuals in his DVJ sets, Sander includes Pioneer among his sponsors for these innovative performances.  The manufacturer has been involved with outfitting select clubs around the world with the SVM-1000 audio-visual mixer (which Kleinenberg helped develop), DVJ players, plasma televisions, and other custom video installations exclusively for his performances. \r\nIntegrating music and images single-handedly requires sharpened skills and on-the-fly invention. \"Now, in the process of DJing, I am in control of another dimensions. The thought processes are not just about music; there is a visual element as well.\" Which allows his to shape his identity, and stimulate crowds, in a host of fresh ways. \"This is a whole new way of looking at what you do creatively. In the end, that is very challenging. It makes you more versatile as well. I love keeping on my toes.\" \r\nSander will continue to show off his aesthetic flexibility at residencies around the world during the course of the year, including Pacha in Ibiza, Avalon in Los Angeles, Discoteque in Moscow, and Melkweg in Amsterdam. Each of these gigs affords him unique creative opportunities; the exclusivity and luxury of Pacha elicits different impulses from him than the storied, historic Avalon, pristine sound quality of Discoteque, or the iconic pop temple status of Melkweg for example. Which is how he likes it. \"Residencies are like laboratories: You can go in and experiment. As you get to know the sound system and the clientele, and become comfortable, you have more faith in each potential change of direction.\" \r\n\r\nThe year 2011 will be the year of the release of Sander Kleinenberg's debut album '5K'.\r\nThis is what Sander has to say himself about the album:\r\n\r\n''I’m sure the listener will find the ambivalence between the DJ in me trying to make a soundtrack for Saturday night and the writer in me trying to write a substantial song with more depth to it.” Sander explains, “The internal battle bothered me for a long time and it’s obvious that I’ve been struggling to chose sides. As a matter of fact I’m still not sure but simply had to move forward. I noticeably tried to marry the two on this album and in my humble opinion succeeded, which resulted in this exciting ‘5K’ studio album on which I’ve been working for the past year and a half. It’s been great working with such a variety of extremely talented people in order to make this happen.''\r\n\r\nThose “extremely talented people” include British jazz singer/songwriter Jamie Cullum, an artist whose involvement in Sander’s album may well turn some heads. In fact, it represents exactly what Sander wanted to achieve with his LP and in-turn Jamie admits “I’ve watched Sander for many years from the dancefloor as a fan, so it was an absolute dream come true to work with him! He’s an amazing producer to work with.”\r\n\r\nAcross 5K you not only get a true account of all the sounds that are currently exciting Sander, but you get all the experience and wisdom that a 20-year DJ career has brought, This really Is Sander Kleinenberg. Starting with a nod towards his first love of De La Soul, Jungle Brothers and A Tribe Called Quest, ‘This Love’ featuring Ace Reign opens the album in style with a high-energy rap of the highest quality. Flowing smoothly into ‘Remember When’ (the Jamie Cullem single) and then into ‘Follow Me’, Sander quickly sets his stool out that this is not an album consisting of 10 instrumental dancefloor bangers, in fact, despite it’s very danceable sound it’s quite the opposite, packed full of character and radio-appeal.\r\n\r\nAnother point worth noting is the flow that Sander’s achieved on 5K, deliberately choosing not to use gaps between each track, the album (although not seamlessly beat matched) builds in a way not too dissimilar to a DJ set. With the opening three tracks sucking you in, Sander then drops ‘The Healer’ – a straight up four to the floor banger – into ‘The Journey’ featuring Kraak & Smaak and Ursula Rucker – a classic Moroder-like analogue-synth journey – and then the huge summer club anthem ‘M.A.N.I.A.C.’ – the biggest dancefloor-focused track on the album.\r\n\r\nFrom there Sander diversifies again, drawing on his love of epic rock, ‘Closer’ featuring Neil Ormandy could easily be mistaken for U2 or The Killers. Followed by Sander’s “attempt at being French”, the 80’s-inspired vocodered ‘R.Y.A.N.L.’ (Rock you all night long) and then into ‘Disko Riot’ ft Jon Fugler, which is, in Sander’s own words “a techno protest song written strongly to stand up against what the world of money has done to us all – how bankers obsessed with wealth have fucked us all over… and still do.”\r\n\r\n‘Chemically’ featuring Ryan Starr is strongly influenced by The Prodigy, with rave breaks providing the backdrop to Ryan’s perfectly suited vocals – a real standout on the album. With the brilliant Nathan ‘Flutebox’ Lee, providing his services for an almost dubstep reprise with ‘This Love’, the album then draws to a close with ‘Wish I Said’ featuring Miss Montreal – a deeply personally song dedicated to Sander’s mother and all the things he wanted to say to her before she passed away.\r\n\r\nIt’s an emotional end to a very personal album. An album that’s been developed and worked on for a lot longer than most, we only hope that the follow up is not too far in the future. You already knew Sander Kleinenberg the DJ, you now know Sander Kleinenberg the artist.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I mean, who wouldn’t want to acquire fortune and fame through partying, right? Because that’s essentially wat DJing is: leading a party. It’s having utter control over a venue, its atmosphere and its people, by changing and manipulating the music while simultaneously being a participant of the whole ordeal. It’s as fun as it is enticing.\r\nFame, fortune and excess weren’t why Salomao Nunes (better known as sa.lomaonun.es in the club scene) decided to give DJing a go, though. No, his partying career had much more humble origins: his love for friends. If it wasn’t for his fun-loving, life-embracing amigos and his desire to entertain them even after the clubs‘ closing times, he probably never would’ve touched a set of turntables himself.\r\nThat said, he has always had an affinity for danceable music. Electronica has been a staple of his musical diet since day one; in his earlier years he even listened to a lot of rap and hip hop. It’s when he started going to clubs as a young adult that he realized that he didn’t just wanted to consume music, he wanted to be an active part of it. Unfortunately, it was almost as if the universe was trying to stop him from doing exactly that: not only was beat matching with CDs and vinyl proving to be a more arduous task than he initially imagined, but his mother also threw his prized vinyl collection out the door one day.\r\n \r\nAt that point, it was easy for Salomao to think that, maybe, he just wasn’t meant to be a DJ.\r\n \r\nHe stopped pursuing the DJing business for a while, but that didn’t mean he didn’t still regularly fantasize about it. After all, partying was in his DNA, since, ironically, his mother used to give parties at their house all the time. Once an inhabitant of Angola, she enjoyed playing music with very distinct African roots at those parties, which helped shape Salomao’s relationship with ensnaring rhythms and immersive beats (even if he wasn’t particularly fond of his mother’s choice of music back then).\r\n \r\nAlways hungry for more music, he discovered psychedelic trance and goa in 2002 and became instantly infatuated. Especially in a country like Portugal, which seemingly has always been more into rock than dance music, Salomao’s discovery of the genre truly felt like a revelation. This spurred him to attend the Boom Festival, which he calls a “true turning point” in his career, after which he was 100% sure that he absolutely could not live without electronic music in his life.\r\nThe lack of dance events in Portugal was still being a major problem, though. Furthermore, he was in a steady relationship at that time that almost forced him to settle down. So despite his newfound determination to become a DJ, in 2005, Salomao got the feeling that his partying life was coming to a sad halt.\r\n... But then Amsterdam happened.\r\n \r\nSalomao’s job had given him the opportunity to work abroad and he embraced that opportunity immediately. Could moving to The Netherlands mean a revitalization of his partying spirit? It most certainly could! The country’s capital turned out to be such a fantastic breeding ground for his passions, that, within a year, he decided to stay there for good. He started going out again, to parties, festivals and other cultural gatherings where electronic music could be found in abundance. And he loved it. He was back with a vengeance.\r\n \r\nOn a fateful night in 2009, Salomao decided to go clubbing in one of Amsterdam’s most well-known clubs, where, all of a sudden, he found himself standing in the DJ booth. He decided to use that opportunity to study the DJ’s actions. He kept listening to the music and the changes that occurred every time the DJ touched a button, knob or fader, until he said to himself: “This is actually not that complicated. Maybe I’ve been looking at DJing the wrong way. I need to give it another go.”\r\n \r\nThe next day, Salomao immediately bought some DJ software.\r\n \r\nA few months later, after loads of experimentation and building a library of great music, Salomao finally started feeling like a real DJ. He started making mixtapes and really long mixes for the sole purpose of seeing how long he could work the decks without needing a break. He was not just developing an ear for mixing, he was also training the rest of his body to respect his new passion.\r\n \r\nHis first real gig took place in November 2009, when a friend asked him to show off his new skills at a birthday party. “I’ll happily do it, but if you think the music sucks, let me know and I’ll stop”, Salomao said humbly and nervously. But he didn’t need to worry, as he played a fantastic two-hour set that flew by and got everyone at the party in a fun frenzy. The feedback was amazing. It was time to step up his game.\r\n \r\nConfident that he had finally developed a unique mixing style, he started giving parties of his own and accepting gigs at small venues, with varying degrees of success. It helped him further cement his position as an upcoming DJ and to iron out the kinks in his sets. But after acquiring professional gear and throwing some well received Queensday parties, he realized that there was one more thing he needed to focus on if he truly wanted to DJ on a satisfying level: organizing his own events.\r\nThe only real downside of Amsterdam’s rich electronic music culture, was the abundance of DJs. Therefore, good gigs weren’t exactly easy to acquire. Luckily, Salomao has always had a knack for organizing events, but this time around, he wasn’t alone. He found some like-minded people with good organizational skills and an insatiable appetite for parties. Before he knew it, MIDI-Club was born.\r\n \r\nAnd MIDI-club is going strong. Having thrown an array of successful parties in the hottest clubs in Amsterdam ever since its conception in 2011, MIDI-club is now more than just a way for Salomao and his friends to contribute something to Amsterdam’s riveting nightlife. It has become a seal of quality; a name that people ‘in the know‘ flock to whenever they want the best percussive house, techhouse and techno have to offer.\r\n \r\n“I love to play for friends and with friends”, Salomao always says with a smile. No other sentence could explain his growing popularity more eloquently.\r\n\r\n\r\nby Samuel Hubner Casado",

In keeping an open mind towards the music he makes, he is known for his surprising and hard to label productions that stand out in sets of DJ’s from all over the EDM spectrum.\r\n\r\nRoger views a club night performance as an archaic ceremony where people gather and have profound experiences through repetitive music and dance. Via keen use of narrative and melody in his sets, he is able to seduce his audiences into joining him on vast sonic journeys, culminating in a unifying experience he always tries to communicate through the music. To him dance music is as much an art form as for instance painting and therefore he always seeks to keep an artistic touch in the tried and trodden landscape of the age old and entrancing 4x4 rhythm.\r\n\r\nMore evidence of his broad interest in sound is his Ambient project called “Horizontal Excursions”. Under this guise Martinez explores immense worlds of sonic emotions. Going full circle in the audio realm, he also occasionally designs sound installations and takes part in interdisciplinary art projects.",

His musical taste and influences constantly evolved throughout the years. Sander started DJ’ing at the age of 16. After a whole year of listening records and visiting party's throughout the country, Sander slowly got in touch with techno while getting his inspiration from artists like; Richie Hawtin, Sven Väth, Speedy J and Chris Liebing. He started playing hard and dark techno stuff for a few years before he switched to a more minimalistic, housey sound. After teaming up with his friend and colleague Tom Noah in 2005, things really started to evolve. As a duo, Sander and Tom have had gigs all over Holland including; Free Your Mind festival, Riverdance, Rekord3r, Cocoon, Planet Rose, The City is Yours and in established clubs like Doornroosje, Tivoli, Paradiso, Studio 80, Nighttown, Catwalk, LVC and Gelredome.\r\n\r\nIn 2004 Sander started the concept “Complexed”. He asked Tom to join in 2005 when things really started to evolve. Together they build “Complexed” into a successful event where they were DJ’ing as residents. Soon they conquered the Leiden area with their deep and funky DJ-sets and got noticed by other promoters. Their journey through numerous events throughout the country saw them performing together at places like; Doornroosje, Tivoli, Studio 80, Patronaat, Gelredome, Simplon, Woodstock, Hotel Arena, Whoosah, Off-Corso and Catwalk.\r\n\r\nBecause of the success of “Complexed”, it was time for Sander and Tom to start a new concept in the bigger LVC under the name “This is Complexed”. At the same time they started doing festival events in the Leiden city centre during the yearly Queensday and Leiden’s Ontzet dates under the name KLIKK. Nowadays, all of their events are under the KLIKK flag and the guys have been performing alongside many National and International artists. These include; Ben Sims, Marco Bailey, Steve Rachmad, Andre Galluzzi, Joel Mull, Daniel Stefanik, Heiko Laux, Speedy J, Joris Voorn, Davide Squillace, The Advent, Valentino Kanzyani, Technasia, James Ruskin, Jerome, Bart Skils, Shinedoe, Dave Ellesmere, Secret Cinema, Estroe, Luke Slater, Lauhaus, David Labeij, Miss Djax, Luna City Express, Jason & The Argonauts, Wouter de Moor, Kabale Und Liebe and many more..\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sander found his way as a radio host, presenting the monthly KLIKK radio show on Unity FM (www.unityfm.nl) and into the studio working together with Tom on their production skills for over more than two years. Their first productions are soon to be expected… Stay tuned!\r\n\r\nFor more info and bookings, please visit:\r\nwww.klikkmusic.nl \r\n",

Carrying the title “Rotterdam’s best kept secret” for several years now, his style of music has never been easily caught in a couple of words but best described as a suprising and distinct mix between deephouse, progressive, house, groove and tech-house. Deep, groovy and uplifting with an energetic drive. His “my definition of Deep House’ and 'Darkside of the Moon' series on Soundcloud have grown to become popular amongst many loyal followers. These mixes represent what his musical view stands for, deeper house in all its forms and shapes. \r\n\r\nSandeep started dj-ing in 2003. With monthly nights in legendary Dutch clubs like Las Palmas, Off Corso, Nighttown and Winkel van Sinkel his dj star rose and after being nominated twice as ‘Talent of the Year’ at the dutch dance awards (Gouden Kabouter) a few years later, he decided to really go for it. Since then he has played almost every club and festival in the Netherlands like Time Warp NL, DGTL Festival, Welcome to the Future, Pleinvrees, Straf_Werk, Free Your Mind Festival, Cocoon NL, Rockit Open Air and Solar Weekend to name a few. Sharing the stage with all the big names in the business including Laurent Garnier, Loco Dice, Mano Le Tough and Solomun. \r\n\r\nThe past years Sandeep was the programmer and resident dj of the legendary Catwalk Club in Rotterdam. Nowadays, next to playing many festivals, (beach)parties and clubnights, Sandeep hosts his own monthly night “The Deep” in Rotterdam’s hotspot Toffler. A night that showcases his favourite artists from around the globe. Also he holds acclaimed residencies for major dutch players like DGTL, Whoosah Beachclub, Undertone, Give Soul, Toffler and Claydrum events.",

As a kid he was already interested in music and anything that had to do with pressing buttons. When he was a little older one of his friends had bought a set of decks and it didn’t take long for Roell to get familiar with it and it turned out he was quit talented. Not very long after that roell bought his own set and records and started making his own mix tapes. In those days he met dj/producer Francesco Pico who had just started a record store and they immediatly had a click musically as well as they became good friends. In 2002 they starting spinning records together as resident djs at Club Rage in Rotterdam and played a lot of after parties together. Now in 2008, times change and the 12” records had to make place for the digital age, Roell has created his own sound working the crowd with tech house /progressive beats. It Doesn’t matter if it building up for another dj, playing on the main hours or taking over at the end, Roell always delivers quality and knows how to work the crowd. \r\n\r\nAs producer Roell Sapphire started his career a few years ago and his first release on Magnitude recordings was a fact in 2005. Since then things went fast and he became one of Magnitude recordings main artists, but also had releases on other labels like odori and spinifex. His track “stuck in the middle” in 2006 was a big success and was played on the big festivals and also appeared on Paul Hazendonks sound shifting cd. Massive support on Roell’s releases come from well known dj’s like Hernan Cattaneo, Eelke Kleijn, Francesco Pico, DJ Remy, Erick E, Harold Heath, Mazi, Marco G, Murray Richardson, Kriece , Nacho Marco, nosmo & Kriss B, Sasha Le monnier, Stallos and many others. Besides producing solo Roell also started a collaboration with DJ/producer and mate Francesco Pico. As themselves and under the name Stuccato fusion they have made a lot of succesfull tracks.

His mother was especially of great musical importance to him, as she also fed him with an endless supply of eighties music and disco. It suffices to say he was exposed to a wide variety of musical styles from his early childhood onwards.\r\n\r\nIn his teen years he would often come to the Netherlands to visit his relatives. This is where he got in touch with house music, a genre completely unknown to most Cape Verdeans at the time.\r\n\r\nAfter settling himself permanently in the Netherlands, he took the opportunity to delve into the house scene and further immerse himself in music.\r\nBy digging through records, he was able to further pinpoint his genres: deep house, tech house and dub techno. Through all of this, his interest in presenting music grew.\r\n\r\nBoth as a DJ and as a producer he aims at delivering melancholic, but warm and loving music with good bass, bouncy high hats, and a sexual undercurrent.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2014 he was able to bring his love of house back to his Cape Verdean home as co-headliner of UNDERGROUND Mindelo.\r\n\r\n‘I would literally die, if I wasn’t able to do anything with music. It’s how I express myself. I play on feeling. I want to exude warmth. I want to give energy. I want a kind of symbiosis with the audience, an interplay.’",

Where other kids from his age were listening to music that dictated the charts. Sander listened to old vinyl records of live concerts from major soul acts like James Brown and Otis Redding. The intensity and passion present in the soul music inspired Sander. It doesn’t take a scientist to know that this feeling for music was just the beginning.\r\n\r\nAs he grew older, he made his first encounter with the DJ scene. Watching his older cousin mixing R’n’B and HipHop beats on his turntables, he knew for sure that this was what he wanted to do. As he visited more clubs he became more and more intrigued by the uplifting and pumping beats called ‘House music’. The way how these beats just made you feel the music reminded Sander of the good old soul music, a new love was born. Now-a-days Sander Young is a DJ that has managed to create his own sound characterized as quality house music with a feel good vibe.\r\nNext to spinning music, Sander is also a talented producer. His talent for both mixing and producing has not gone unnoticed. In October 2010 Sander Young won the Let’s Mix ADE Next contest. Since this contest focused heavily on the combined skill of DJing and producing, it’s evident that Sander Young is a talented DJ/Producer. This contest also granted him to play live at the 2010 ADE. As a producer Sander has released tracks on labels like 90Watts, Frameworx Recordings and the iconic Global Underground. Receiving support from DJ’s like Carlo Lio, Laurent Garnier, Sharam, Kevin Saunderson, Gregor Tresher, Saeed Younan, Joan Ribas, Butch, Michel de Heij, Nick Warren and Wally Lopez.\r\n\r\nNext to DJ’ing and producing solo, Sander is also one part of the DJ duo Sander Young & Pieter Steijger. Together they share an immense passion for dance music. This passion is expressed through their unique sound influenced by the roots from Chicago house and Detroit techno, replenished with groove and percussive sounds.",

Roel Salemink chose to combat small town syndrome by developing\r\nhis passion for music, spending his formative years obsessing over different styles of music.\r\n\r\nBy the early 90s he had become hooked on house, a habit he has never since managed to kick.\r\nAfter experimenting with various iterations of the genre he began to focus more on techhouse and techno, \r\nwhich to this day continues to be his greatest passion.\r\n\r\nProfessionally, his musical journey began when he started organising and promoting techno parties, \r\nbooking headline acts like Marco Bailey, Secret Cinema, Peter Horrevorts, Takaaki Itoh,\r\nChristian Wunsch, Pacou, Recyver Dogs and Darko Esser to name a few. \r\nThe success of these events gave Roel the confidence to develop his own event, the magnificent and memorable Magnifique.\r\n\r\nThis event saw him take to the stage alongside a whole host of famous names, including Secret Cinema, Bart Skils, Isis, Marco Bailey, Joey Beltram\r\nand many more. Keen to use his promotional skills across Europe and beyond, he has also hosted a stage at the famous German\r\nFestival Ruhr In Love which is attending by over 30.000 people.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 2008 that Salemink seriously turned his attention to producing. It speaks volumes that his first ever release, techno tune\r\nManalive, became an instant classic. Put out by the famous Bush Records, home to the likes of Carl Cox and Dave Clarke, the track spent\r\na solid eight weeks in the number one spot on the Beatport chart. The track was featured on a number of compilations, including Carl Cox\r\nrecorded live at Dance Valley, and Salemink's reputation was sealed. His tunes regularly receive big name support from the likes of Carl\r\nCox, Pete Tong, Pig&Dan, Mauro Picotto, Tom Hades, Marco Bailey, Loco & Jam and a whole host more. \r\n\r\nThere are plenty of exciting projects in the pipeline for this exceptionally talented DJ, promoter and producer this year. \r\nHe will finish his album and also a huge mix compilation. Both releases of course together with his partner in crime Drumcomplex.\r\nCheck out his online pages to see al of his forthcoming releases in 2014. This exciting foray into techno history, \r\nborn partly from nostalgia and partly from a desire to keep the sound fresh and current, promises to be something truly special and certainly worth watching out for.\r\n\r\nRoel Salemink already did some awesome gigs across Europe and there are more gigs planned for him already.\r\nFurthermore Salemink will release a lot of new tracks & remixes on some decent labels such as Intec, MB Elektronics, Phobiq, Driving Forces, Deeperfect, BlaBla, IAMT and many more.\r\nIf you are interested in having your release remixed by Roel Salemink please feel free to contact us.\r\n\r\nhttp://roelsalemink.com\r\nhttp://facebook.com/roelsalemink\r\nhttp://soundcloud.com/roelsalemink\r\nhttp://gigs.gigatools.com/user/roelsalemink",

Their inspiration has a very wide range: early electronics like Kraftwerk; neue deutsche welle: like Der Plan and Andreas Dorau; minimal music: like Wim Mertens and Michael Nyman. And ofcourse the dance movement from the mid 90’s: from Roni Size and Basement Jaxx to the whole Compost Posse, Jazzanova, K&D and dZihan&Kamien.\r\n\r\nIn dj-sets, R&M take the audience from drum’nbass to nu-jazz to hiphop to electro to jazz to funk and back to house. An eclectic listening experience. DJ-sets often last several hours. \r\n\r\nThe dj-style is reflected in their own productions. Sometimes there’s a drum’nbass influence, sometimes hiphop or plain 4/4 house or electro. But always with a leftfield basis.\r\n\r\nBesides the music, R&M have ‘normal’ jobs.

It took untill 2000 before he decided to really go for dj-ing and throwing his own party’s. In 2004 he won a major dj contest and played at a festival in front of 15.000 people.\r\n He got more and more interested in producing his own tracks so in 2008 he started producing on a very low level, but as time went by he got better and better and in the summer of 2011 he started producing with Ableton, and all fell in place…only last summer he sighned for 10 releases, most of them in a great collab between VITALY KATZ and STAN HOLLAND.\r\n His sound is groovy and full of rythm : Tech-house, Techno, Progressive-house and Tribal.\r\n In the future there is MUCH MORE to come……..",

Music created by this artist, is exactly what his name represents\r\n— Enlightenment and Energy.We are born in a chaotic age, all looking for our own space.\r\nA space that exists beyond ideas of what’s right and what’s wrong.\r\nA space where we can surrender, and find ourselves. Satori helps us find our way.\r\n\r\nSatori is inspired to capture electronic world music, where he combines endless blends of seductive trance and mind-altering earthy tones. It is not defined by any-one genre. Satori is here to satisfy any meditative music-lover by provoking a spiritual journey through his infinite sound-garden. Listen as you take on new dimensions of his musical world, where movement, dreaming and creativity are endless. Let the sound live in your heart, harvesting every last memory of dance and rhythm. Satori’s sound is more than just a switch on a soundboard; he is the man behind the instrument, creating melodies from the piano, kora, kalimba, and guitar in combination with a deeper form of electronic music.\r\n\r\nWhenever you’re ready, Satori will meet you there, to the place one can only dream of.",

With the recent (re)launch of his second label, Kinky Vinyl, this young entrepreneur shows no signs of slowing down.\r\n\r\nHe put out his first release in 2007 and since then has racked up an impressive back catalogue of labels including Noir Music, Plastic City, Dark Energy Recordings, Kolour Recordings, I! Records, Seamless Recordings and Night Drive Music.\r\n\r\nVarious EPs and singles for a diversity of labels followed but it is the ‘Nightbird’ single on Kinky Vinyl – remixed by Manuel Tur – that is definitively the biggest single for Sebastian so far and remains a Deep House classic.\r\n\r\nFollowing the success of these releases Sebastian went traveling extensively all over the world spreading a unique sound combining Deep House and Downtempo Beats. With an emphasis on the deeper end of electronic house music, but not afraid to stray from the path, he retains an old school approach that has seen him booked for gigs as diverse as Moog (Barcelona), Audio Tonic (Dubai), Loveland Festival (Amsterdam), Salon Daome (Montreal), Grodan (Stockholm), Mynt (Belfast) and J-Pop (Tokyo).\r\n\r\nSebastian Davidson founded his Nightbird Music record label in 2009 to show the world his view on the deephouse spectrum. It’s safe to say he did a little more than just that. The releases seem to have a subscription on Traxsource’s Deep House Top 10 and are played all across the world.\r\n\r\nRe-launching early 2015, Kinky Vinyl is the “new” breakout label to the Nightbird Music family, focusing on fresh, new and undiscovered talent.\r\n\r\nKinky Vinyl and its later day incarnation as Kinky Digital was founded by UK DJ’s Joel Xavier & Andy Lekker. With a large fan base and following since its inception in 2000, Kinky Vinyl quickly established itself as a name synonymous for quality, funky, forward thinking dance music with artists such as Mike Monday, Guy Gerber, Sucker DJs, Deepgroove, Richard Dinsdale, Anton Nuemark, Sebastian Davidson and more made the label the success that it has been over the last 13 years…a music catalogue stuffed with gems.",

  "artist_bio": "Once you know that her real first name, Chinedum, is Nigerian for ‘God is leading me’, and you replace the word god with music, you have a pretty clear picture of what Shinedoe is about. Her story has been one of a relentless, infectious passion for high quality electronic dance music from the moment she caught the bug two decades ago.\r\nAnd for quite a while now she has been one of those blessed people who travel the globe, creating and spinning cutting edge pieces ranging from techno to house. Always with a sharp eye on the future, a keen ear for what’s hot, and both feet set firmly intraditions from places such as Detroit, Chicago and Amsterdam.Completely in tune with the underground’s do‐it‐yourself attitude, Shinedoe has left her mark on several aspects of the scene over the years. Starting in 2001 her Amsterdam based Inmotion parties presented the international elite of techno and tech house to the capital’s community. Something she nowadays does at Intacto Nights. Named after the imprint she founded in 2004 together with 2000 and One, this label night is her way to represent the brand’s impressive and diverse catalogue, and showcase its artists.\r\n\r\nBut most people probably know Shinedoe simply from dancing to her music. The down to‐earth, positive vibe that surrounds her speaks out loudly in her compositions as well as in her dj‐sets. A talent leading to a warm welcome on dance floors from Spain to China, long before her first single Dillema (100 % Pure) gave her that last push in 2004. An instant anthem across the board, you could hear it being played by The Big Three (S,R,R) as well as by your local rave head during his Saturday night shift at the bar; it was everywhere... Quickly after that Phunk, released on the newly founded Intacto, and at least as powerful, sealed the deal and changes her status to ‘here to stay’. Since then a series of trademark tracks made its way from her studio to a long list of releases on numerous labels (Get Physical, Cocoon, Bpitch Control, Trapez, Safari Electronique, Music Man, etc).\r\n\r\nNext to playing the worlds club circuit, 2014 is the year of Illogical Directions. After Sound Travelling (2006), and No Boundaries (2009) it’s the third artist album on which she explores the possibilities of the 4/4 realm, sometimes joined by like‐minded musicians. From the slow opening track Release Yourself with its jazz‐like drums, passed the ominous vocals on Discourse Of My New Romance, to the raw 909 patterns and acid sounds of Get Dirty, it turned out a trip worth taking if you like the real deal. She kindly invites you to listen and learn more about her, her music and Intacto through the usual channels, or visit one of her shows in a club near you.",

He learned the tricks of the\r\ntrade from Nubian, who was resident of the DJ Insane Jungle parties in\r\nNighttown in that period.\r\nSilvahfonk's first alias was \"Energy\", as his friends give him that\r\nname cause of his energetic personality and performance. It was so\r\nobvious that it became his trademark.\r\n\r\nIn the past 16 years Silvahfonk made quite a development to put drum &\r\nbass in a creative way on the Dutch map. In 2005, Silvahfonk won two\r\nDutch drum & bass awards as 'Best Breakthrough DJ' and 'Best DJ'.\r\nFrom 2005 till present, he performed at many leading national and\r\ninternational events like: Innovation in the Dam / Clash of the\r\nTitans, Amsterdam Dance Event, Stealth Bombers (Belgium) and London's\r\nTechnicality.\r\n\r\nIn 2007 Silvahfonk started co-producing deep, musical and rolling drum\r\n& bass, together with the respected producer and DJ, Mindmapper. Many\r\ntunes are signed and released, including the famous tune \"Flash\r\nForward\" on the Swiss label Demand Records. Also the mysterious track\r\n\"Collapse\" is a recent track, released on the label Soundium X. Their\r\nproductions are supported by DJ Hype, Dieselboy, Doc Scott, Loxy,\r\nKlute, LTJ Bukem, Nymfo, Madcap, Fre4knc and Adi J to name a few.\r\n\r\n( youtube.com / MindmapperandSilvahfonk)\r\n\r\nSilvahfonk is resident at two events: Spread the Bass in Hoofddorp and\r\nIChiOne, where he is a resident DJ since 2007 and ambassador of this\r\ninternationally respected music event, which started as a small\r\n\"underground\" party in Pakhuis Wilhelmina and has grown into a busy,\r\nbeautiful, visual, musical and culinary event at OT301 in Amsterdam.\r\nSilvahfonk his roots are from the jungle sound with jazz, hip-hop,\r\nreggae and soul elements. Though he is not afraid to drop some raw\r\nsolid rollers with a techno feeling. It involves creativity and\r\nfeelings to tell a story during his sets, no matter which slot he has\r\non the timetable. Variation is the key for what he wants to tell you.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Dutch DJ , Producer & hosting own club nights in The Netherlands.\r\n\r\nSigned on Spinnin Records and released singles and remixes on Cr2 Records, Sneakerz Muzik, Stealth Records, Subliminal records and many others to come.\r\n\r\nSupported by Laidback Luke, Afrojack , Erick Morillo, Rene Amesz and Roger Sanchez just to name a few.Sebastien Lintz is fast becoming known and respected in the world of house music. Not just among the many top DJs who are supporting him, but among a wide audience. The remix he and Simon Gain did of Superstar, by DJ Eako and Inaya Day, has had nearly half a million hits on Youtube to date. Still only young, Sebastien has a string of successes, and many more in the pipeline.\r\n\r\nSuccesses also include a number one in the Dance Tunes top 100 (his remix of Like This by Phillippe B and Romain Curtis), and others which reached the top 20 on Beatport and Dance Tunes. His original production House Maestro showed the kind of work he could produce, defining a style of his own, and making a big impact with DJs all over the world. House Maestro made it to the Beatport top 20 and onto several CD and digital compilations so far. Some great remixes were produced by Rene Amesz, DJ Siege and Digital Lab.\r\n\r\nSebastien is still only 21. Born in the Netherlands on 3rd Nov 1988, he grew up at the same time as the house music scene which had just started in Chicago. However it was the discovery (pardon the pun!) of a Daft Punk CD in his cousin’s record collection that inspired him the most, and with that came an obsession with the whole French house scene that pioneers like Daft Punk had started. On the advice of his brother in law, a DJ, he joined the Laidback Luke forum. Luke was known to be extremely helpful to up and coming producers with talent. This was an important decision, and a good one, because Sebastien got help off Luke, Afrojack, Bart B More, Bingo Players and others who were active on the forum at the time. Luke had also discovered and assisted these producers in getting where they are today. With his natural talent, enthusiasm, hard work, and with Laidback Luke as a mentor, things were bound to happen.\r\n\r\nSebastien’s first track was the In The Air remix (made with Alex Salvador), a very successful start.  The tune became an underground house hit, and was supported by big names such as Roger Sanchez (who’s label Stealth released it)  and of course Laidback Luke and others. The track uniquely combined a Chicago house beat with big room stabs and a big baseline drop to produce a new style – the Big Room remix.\r\n\r\nA string of remixes soon followed, all receiving acclaim from DJs, and a following was gradually building. Sebastien was named as a ‘new upcoming talent’ by Laidback Luke in a radio interview, who later invited him to play at Super You&Me in the Netherlands, and then another in Switzwerland.\r\n\r\nNow he became motivated to work even harder, with a desire to reach the top!\r\n\r\nIn 2010 he signed a three single contract with Spinnin’ Records, one of the biggest labels in dance music. More remixes followed, and soon it was time to start releasing original material. House Maestro was produced, and was a big success. At the time of writing, a new original (Mumba) is in the completion process. Combining world music samples with house and a progressive touch, Sebastien is again showing his originality and producing new styles.\r\n\r\nIn between producing his originals, he found time this year to do some remixes, and one, Blackwater (made with Angger Dimas), was made part of an ‘essential selection’ by none other than Pete Tong!\r\n\r\nWhen he isn’t busy making music, organising parties, or DJing, he likes listening to other genres such as jazz and film scores, watching movies, and doing the geeky stuff producers seem to be prone to -  checking all the latest software and gadgets.\r\n\r\nOne thing Sebastien’s career is not doing is ‘going all Pete Tong’! Currently he is working with some live artists and is developing his sound engineering skills to move on to a new level. Watch this space.\r\n",

Always searching for those rare gems in dark, dusty old record stores, they often come home with the same records. Their dj sets are diverse and they developed a particular sound, resulting from the interesting mix of their personalities you can expect Disco cuts, Africa beats, Ambient stuff and Industrial House grooves.

A household name for over a decade in the Netherlands , aka mc spyder ,making a dancefloor move is doing what he loves most …listen as simon defines deep house bring your ears close, bring your body closer and move to the dark sexy basslines\r\nSimon Titus started out in the UK playing a variety of clubs, parties and bars as MC Spyder, pushing his unique voice and sound with his team of creators such as DJ Timmy Boomkat, MJ Cole and many other producers of the modern sound we all know today.\r\nAs one of the people to introduce Amsterdam to the UK garage sound, he has evolved as the times changed continuing to push his limits, offering the next level of what he has been exposed to in his wide spread travels. Simon Titus has been a fixture of the Amsterdam music scene for over 10 years. Working Groovemaster Johnsons party “Bubbleclub” in 98 as well as being a resident of the legendary RoXY.\r\n\r\nAs Mc Spyder, he was the host/MC of parties like SpeedFreax, Dancevalley, Latin Village, Extrema, Drumm Rhythm Festival, The City Is Ours, MysterLand, The Rotterdam Dance Parade and many more unique gigs along the way. More recently he has been working on the UK Funky and Shake Up Projects in venues all around Holland such as Escape, Rex, Manhattan, Club Noa as well as many other pop up gigs to keep things fresh. You can catch Simon Titus  DJ’ing all around the EU under the name Vinyl Cru (www.vinylcru.nl) or under his real name Simon Titus. Never being one to be tied down to one spot, Simon is always traveling and promoting the scene and music he loves so much, as well as pushing his limits by working in Television and Radio. Spyder is the feature voice over for the Suzuki Swift Ad campaign (06-10). As well as collaborating with top industry professionals on his own sound leading to his joining of the group “Spark”. The first single they dropped, “I Dream Of You Baby” was a huge success in the UK and Netherlands dance scenes, finding its way in to almost every DJ’s bag of tricks for some time.\r\n\r\nSimon as Mc Spyder came back in 05 working with Olav Basoski on a track called “Waterman”, this appropriate title echoed the flood gate of success the track would go on to achieving. Eventually ending up with the coveted Gold Record status in the EU, released in over 25 countries and toping the dance charts in many hotspots around the world. Following up the success of WaterMan, Olav and Spyder hit off “Like dis” featuring a remix by Fedde Le Grand. Hitting the decks in 06 it found a strong hold on many DJ’s ears and was another strong showing of the unique vibe Spyder flows with.",

After finding his love in spinning vinyl, he had to move to Holland for studying. This is where he came in contact with his love for electronic music.\r\nHaving played alongside names as Gayle San, Mike Drama, Oliver Kucera, Frank Kvitta, Sven Wittekind and many more, he has shown a style that makes those party feet move nonstop on the dancefloor. Last summer he was asked to even come and rock the show at Decibel Festival. He has gained allot of respect by some of the bigger names in the scene with his driving and pounding releases, either as a remix or original.\r\n\r\nNowadays he’s releasing material on Elektrax Rec. // Mastertraxx // Burn-Audio // Common Good // Flatlife Rec. // Trust Recordings // Red Section // Kucera Rec. // Gobsmacked Rec. // Extorsion Group Rec.// Gayle San Rec.(GSR) // Naked Lunch // BassAssault Rec. to name a few.\r\n\r\nMore releases to follow soon, so this won’t be the last you’ve heard of him!

From there on he knew that he wanted to make music for the rest of his life.\r\n \r\nAfter seeing a couple of DMC mix championships, his interests were going towards dj-ing. He started dj-ing in 1995 at the age of 14. During that time he mainly played RnB and HipHop tunes at local clubs. He switched his style completely into housemusic in 1999 and\r\nbecame the resident DJ of the ‘Exxellent’ nights at one of Holland’s biggest clubs The Matrixx in 2003. His producing skills really took off in that period.\r\n \r\nHis first real club banger was called ‘Sidney Samson-It’s all funked up!’ (Spinnin’ Records 2003), which had a high rotation by DJ’s like ErickE and Jean.\r\nAfter this release, Sidney knew that he couldn’t stop here and locked himself up in his studio. ‘Nobody Move’, ’Rock This’, ‘Girls’, ‘Aeroplane’ and ‘Viruz’ were some resulting floor fillers, to name but a few.\r\n \r\nIn 2007, after a few successful collaborations with Gregor Salto, they decided to start a new record label named Samsobeats. On this label, new tracks are released from the hottest new DJ’s and producers who showed their talents to the world. Samsobeats wants to set a new feeling instead of a particular sound. That’s why you can expect very various tracks, from electro to latin. Every release must have the potential to grow into a floor filler.\r\n\r\nWith the Skitzofrenix he was responsible for the big summer hit ‘You don’t love me’. This tune is still ripping up the dance floors and was of course released on Samsobeats!\r\n \r\nThen Sidney was hitting the charts with ‘Today’, featuring vocals of the talented Joni. This track is showing another side of Sidney and you can even hear him play the guitar in the breaks…\r\n \r\nAnd last but not least, you really couldn’t have missed it: RIVERSIDE !\r\n \r\nIn charts all over the world for several weeks and even GOLD in Australia;\r\nThe single would have actually moved from #13 in the National Singles chart, back up to number #10, if it hadn't have been for 8 Michael Jackson records entering the top 20.. Riverside is also still in the top 20 of the Club Chart after 24 weeks (!) as this is written.\r\n \r\nThe track is being fully supported by Dj’s like David Guetta, Laidback Luke, Diplo, A-trak, Tiga and Boyz Noize.\r\n \r\nThis is what Guy Garret (DMC) has to say about the single:\r\n \r\nWell Ibiza is in full swing and the big tune that's drilling everybody's head is 'Riverside' motherfucker! Huge wonky techno roller hot from Holland and set to follow fellow Dutch master Fedde Le Grand success with 'Detroit'. The chugging bass is driving from the start and with its tasty drum percussion will have you rocking you side to side more than any rickety boat in a tsunami. Now it's all about that riff, killer hooky melody and out of tune but so hypnotic in rhythm and depth, it's simplistic but so are the best things in life. The aggressive the 'Riverside motherfucker' vox dive in and out the mix to keep the pace punchy and your stompin those night away in no time. With no doubt a heap of remixes to come in for this project but to be honest we only need the deadly original to kill the crowd, banging out all over Ibiza and set to punch a whole in the UK very soon.\r\n\r\n5/5 (essential)\r\n \r\nNew collaborations coming up: As we speak Sidney Samson is in the studio with Diplo and Laidback Luke! Expect a new killer single including video soon, Sidney just got started..\r\n \r\nSome quotes:\r\n\r\nDavid Guetta : Very strong! Support!\r\nLaidback Luke : Bomb!\r\nTom Novy : Very cool track!\r\nSander van Doorn : Very cool tune\r\nBenny Benassi : I like this!!!\r\nTV Rock : This is HOT HOT HOT!",

He co-founded Amsterdam imprint 100% Pure in 1993 and now heads up\r\nthree labels: Thirtyonetwenty - Bitten - Bangbang!\r\n\r\nSandy Hüner released his first tracks in the beginning of the nineties under names like Babies From Gong and Pure on some of the most prestigious labels at the time such as Eevolute, ESP and Beechwood, where 15 releases followed in quick succession.\r\n\r\nIn the early 90s, driven by a need for creative freedom, Sandy and Dylan Hermelijn [2000 and One] teamed up. Based in Amsterdam, the launch of their techhouse label 100% Pure enabled them to spearhead their own vision of dance music. \r\n\r\nSoon releases came from techno visionaries like Steve Rachmad, Orlando Voorn and Steffan Robbers. Detroit legend Derrick May also found his way onto their catalogue.\r\n\r\nTheir album “100% Pure – The Lowlands” on the highly acclaimed New Electronica label in 1994 gleaned massive\r\ninternational attention with featured album reviews from N.M.E, Melody Maker etc. Although Sandy’s passion for music is as huge and diverse as his vinyl collection, he decided in the mid nineties to pursue a career in design leaving Dylan to head up 100% Pure, which is now Amsterdam’s longest running techhouse label.\r\n\r\nThroughout the years Sandy’s impeccable taste for good music remained and 10 years on, inspired by the new sounds emanating from his Amsterdam home town, Sandy became once again deeply involved in the scene.\r\nHaving met Dave Ellesmere in 2006, the two quickly forged a strong friendship which resulted in the creation on their new label thirtyonetwenty (the international dialling code to connect with Amsterdam), now run soley by Sandy. \r\nIn 2008, Sandy and Dylan joined forces again and launched a new house label Bangbang! then in 2009, they co-founded their new techhouse label bitten.\r\n\r\nAs well as managing three labels, Sandy’s addiction for the studio has led him to produce world class club tunes including Rare Tap [Remote Area] with 2000 and One. Following its release he finally succumbed to the club demands for him to DJ, with his first gig at the legendary Voltt party, followed by 2010 dates at Amsterdam’s Studio 80, Paradiso and Berlin’s party hotspot Watergate and 2011 now welcoming him to the international club circuit and Dutch festival greats such as WTTF.\r\n\r\nWith his funky fusion of sassy house harmonies, soulful snippets and techhouse treats – Sandy’s uplifting sets of mashed melodies always leave the party crowds breathless. \r\n\r\nAs Sandy (and the Beastie Boys) once said 'life ain't nothing but a good groove’.",

Only four years old, he was given his first drum set, and wouldn’t let it go. He took drumming lessons for years to come, and when he’d decided he was good enough, joined an Amsterdam punk rock band at the early age of fifteen. With the band, he played at several venues in Amsterdam, and got a first good taste of what playing music in front of a crowd was like. \r\n\r\nEven so, he quit the band when he was eighteen, merely because he’d somewhat fallen out of love with Punk music and very much in love with a different kind of music: House music. After a couple of years of going to clubs, listening to House music and getting to know the enormous variety of styles and sounds within the genre, he had developed a very specific and grounded taste in music. So specific even, that he decided it was time for him to stop searching; and start creating. By this time he’d also found out that he wasn’t the only one around to have discovered the music of the House genre: several people in and around his neighbourhood were on the same track, and ended up joining forces. They became the Amsterdam dj/producer group that is now known by the name ‘De Zorgenkindjes’.\r\n\r\nDJ’ing in several nightclubs and on festivals in and around Amsterdam, Timo Mes (quite literally) turned into Sem Omit.\r\nAfter having DJ’d for some time, he found an actual outlet for his creativity and his love for good music by discovering the ways of several composing software programs and saving every penny to buy decent equipment. By now, he’s created a humble little studio in his house, in which he spends hours of composing, changing, adding, discarding, improving and finishing house tunes in the way house tunes are supposed to be. According to himself, of course.\r\n",

At the age of 14 he sharpened his sense for melodies and harmony playing as a (bass) guitarist in several punk/rock bands. These days, his electronic productions sound similar to his personality: warm and colourful. ‘The feel’ of music is more important than the quality of the kick, he says.

  "artist_bio": "Together with Laurent Garnier, Aphex Twin and Richie Hawtin, Rotterdam’s Speedy J helped define Techno since 1991 with albums like Ginger, G Spot, Public Energy No. 1 and Loudboxer – spearheading labels like Plus 8, Novamute and Warp.\r\nHis latest projects span the audio-visual pioneer work of Umfeld, his label Electric Deluxe, his Event Series Electric Deluxe presents, and his upcoming Album Project.\r\n\r\n*For Bookings please contact*\r\nnatalie@electricdeluxe.netJochem Paap (the Rotterdam artist owes the nickname Speedy J to his DJ skills) is unanimously considered to be one of the first techno producers to come from the Benelux. Together with people like Laurent Garnier, Aphex Twin and Richie Hawtin he helped raising the genre just after it had escaped the Detroit delivery room.\r\nSince the early nineties, Speedy J releases on labels like Plus 8, Warp and Novamute. But while techno develops into a dominating force on many dance floors worldwide, Jochem Paap, after the albums G Spot (1993) and Ginger (1995), turns left and heads for other exciting places.\r\nOn Public Energy No. 1 (1997) and A Shocking Hobby (2000) the sound wizard exchanges flowing, harmonious techno for a much more complex sound, filled with colliding samples, crackling rhythms and tremendously thrilling turns.\r\nAfter fifteen years of techno Speedy J now has come full circle. But what a wide circle it was, and how fickle the trodden path. Over the years he has collaborated with video-artists, filmmakers and advertisers, made the pioneering DVD Umfeld, an audio-visual, electronic trip, which sets the standard for many composers who want to compose for six speakers in the coming years – remarkably made available as a free download on the internet.\r\nBut not only that, Speedy J has continuously been pushing the boundaries of electronic & experimental dance music. Blurring the lines between Live performance and Digital Djing, he fuses subversive electronics and peak time Techno. Together with his partner in crime Chris Liebing he started using Traktor and other Software technology on 4 laptops with hardware such as Machine Drum and 303’s to create a fully integrated set. Again he is spearheading a way of DJing that is picked up by a lot of other forward thinking electronic artists.\r\nLogically, the releases on his label Electric Deluxe all feature tool versions, introducing the concept of creating unique live sets from parts as a natural evolution of Djing. Not only setting the bar for peak hour Techno madness, Electric Deluxe becomes the platform for his Collabs series that started on Novamute, as well as releases by open minded artists like Chris Liebing, George Issakidis, Tommy Four Seven and Terrence Fixmer to showcase the value of creative synergy using newest technology.\r\nAnother strong part of this idea is the introduction of a new series of techno events called Electric Deluxe presents, which in a young history of just a couple of editions brought major artists like Richie Hawtin, Marco Carola, Radio Slave, Matthew Dear, Chris Liebing into play.\r\nSpeedy J’s musical vision is genre blurring, creative freedom at the highest level of innovation and quality, it is providing a platform for artists operating within any conceivable genre in the broad spectrum of techno to fully explore and embrace the ever-expanding technological possibilities.\r\n \r\n",

He’s still based here, and is a key figure in it’s small, but thriving techno scene. \r\nSize was born as Hans Seisveld in 1981 in Leiden, The Netherlands. He’s still based here, and is a key figure in it’s small, but thriving techno scene. \r\n\r\nMusic has always been a very important element in his life. He started to play the guitar in the early nineties and soon started to explore more music styles. In 1995 he got in touch with techno music, visiting lots of events and refining his electronic taste. Three years later, he started playing his first records, a habit he hasn’t kicked since. His passionate skills brought him to play at events like Awakenings, Teqnology, Legalize, Integrate, Decompression, Monocult, A.S.S., mnml.nl and many more.\r\n\r\nThroughout the years he has evolved his own style. It can be described as a mixture of groovy techno, minimal, progressive and acid house. Size likes to explore and cross musical borders and combine different styles in the mix. He started off being known for his energetic techno style, but he only plays that on demand now, preferring the broader spectrum now found in his record bags. He knows like no other how to build up the tension in his sets and please the audience with some tight mixing skills.\r\n\r\nHis love for the music doesn’t stop with spinning records alone. After finishing a sound engineering course in Amsterdam in 2002, production is the next thing on his agenda. With some tracks already finished and lots of projects running, he is going to release at Truesoul Records and 100% Pure records this year (2009). Already huge support from Dubfire, Adam Beyer, Bart Skils, 2000 and one…\r\n\r\nThe 17th of April 2009 Size won the 1st price of “De grote prijs van Zuid-Holland” of the category “Dance and producers”. Besides of that he also won the first price voted by the audience. He’s now participating in the semi finals of “De grote prijs van Nederland”. This will take place in September at “radio 3fm”. He will perform a liveset of 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nAsked which people have inspired him over the years, the list reflects his broad interest in quality electronic music with names as: Adam Beyer, Richie Hawtin, Jeff Mills, Laurent Garnier, Sven Vath, Dave Clarke, Underground Resistance, Robag Wruhme, James Holden, Nathan Fake, James Zabiela, Guido Schneider, Robert Babicz, Abe Duque, Jesper & John Dahlback, Joel Mull, Michael Mayer, Maurizio, Steve Rachmad, Jerome, Aphex Twin and Kraftwerk.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, Hans has become a well known Dj in Leiden. He is the promoter of “Decompression” on of the bigger promoters in Leiden where he played along artists like Joel Mull, Surgeon, 2000 and One, Billy Nasty, Anton Pieete, Regis, Petter, Polder, Julien Chaptal and others. Other parties saw Size on stage next to Steve Rachmad, Dj Rush, Valentino Kanzyani, Ben Sims, Marco Carola, Jerome, Bart Skils, Remy, Guido Schneider, Matthew Dear, Jori Hulkkonen and many more.\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "STERAC is Steve Rachmad's alias that stands for his darker and deeper techno output.Since his earliest productions, Amsterdam’s electronic music pioneer Steve Rachmad has created a legion of monikers for his various compositions. We’ve seen tracks from Black Scor- pion, Tons of Tones, Rachmad Project, Scorp, Parallel 9, Ignacio, Dreg, Sterac Electronics and many more come out of his studio...\r\nOne of the main characters living on Planet Rachmad has always been STERAC: a side of Steve’s musical personality that’s not easily described. Let’s say that where other aliases were used for excursions to more dub-, disco-, or house- oriented records, STERAC’s focus has always been on the no-nonsense, darker, and deeper side of techno.\r\n\r\nThe STERAC discography consists of classic tracks on labels such as M-Plant and Tresor, with the 2012 remixes of his legendary album Secret Life Of Machines (1995) demonstrating the lasting quality of the STERAC oeuvre. Reinterpretations by Ricardo Villalobos, Joris Voorn, and Marc Romboy to name a few, proved a bit hit with fans and fellow artists.\r\n\r\nThis year, STERAC releases appear on Klockworks and Delsin, while his schedule takes him on a tour past the world’s finest clubs: from Berlin’s Berghain to Tokyo’s Womb, and from Output in New York to Club Rex in Paris. On top of that, a series of selected remixes is coming your way.",

  "artist_bio": "SinuZ is an energetic digital DJ duo from Utrecht (NL). They have a broad musical taste ranging from groovy tech-house and solid techno to heavy energetic electro topped off with some occasional dubstep, drumstep or drum&bass.SinuZ is an Utrecht (NL) based digital DJ duo consisting of Thijs van Hasselt and Steven Snoek.\r\n\r\nWhat started with the mouse-mixing of hardstyle and house at the age of 15, developed into high-tech digital 4 decks midi mixing in the present. The hardstyle and house got swapped for heavy jacking electro, dubstep and drumstep music on one side, and groovy tech-house and solid techno on the other.\r\n\r\nTwo very different EDM styles, coming from one very energetic DJ duo.\r\nThe digital mixing, combined with the advantage of four hands instead of two, allows us to do more than was ever possible with vinyl or CD: very fast 4 decks mixing, cutting up tracks using cuepoints, chained effects and filters... add to that a never ending library of blazing tunes and you'll see why we love digital mixing.\r\n\r\nSinuZ is an experienced performer with numerous plays in front of crowds up to several thousands of people at venues in and around Utrecht (including Club Poema, Central Studio's, Ekko, Dock154, and the late Club Elements), as well as in other cities (e.g. Club Seven in the Hague, Club Home in Amsterdam and The Dynamo & De Fabriek in Eindhoven).\r\n\r\nThe music on our Soundcloud page represents our broad musical taste and provides some examples of our mixing skills. If you like what you hear, we invite you to tune in to our weekly radioshow on DeepFM: every Tuesday from 08.00pm to 10.00pm (from tech-house to techno to electro).

  "artist_bio": "Rakesh & Jerry Ray met in 2007 when they both had a residency at Club Purple.\r\nAfter sharing a few gigs they decided to start a collaboration under the name Soulscum.\r\nSoulscum started producing their own tracks in 2009 and nowadays released at high recommended labels such as Strangelove Records, Gooseneck Records and Soul Shift Music.\r\nTheir productions are high quality deep and tech house sounds and already got big support from artist like Tiger Stripes, Redondo ,Jewel Kid, Butch, Hermanez and Daniel Sanchez.\r\nSo make sure you keep an eye on this well talented artists.  \r\nJerry Ray: \r\n\r\nThe story starts at the 29th of april 1982. Jerry Ray Zwinnen is born right above the record store of his father Puck’s platen shop in the center of Arnhem. At the age of 10 he discovered the simple way of mixing music with a double tapedesk just to press on the recordbutton on the right moment and releasing it on the right moment. On his 13th birthday he received a guitar from his dad maybe to lead him into another direction of music, but after a while the guitar was boring him and he bought 2 decks, a simple mixer and a few hardcore records. On his 16th he reached the finales of the Mentos dj challenge but a 3th was all he could get, but it was his first achievement as a dj. After playing over more than 6 years the sound of hardcore/hardstyle at local gigs he decided to change from style. On a bright summer day he walks into the new record store Spincity in Nijmegen. The owner Giovani Solplanit aka dj gio martinez introduced into the latin house and the rest is history. After a residency at Barrio Habana ,Capital X,and Club Purple he played in several clubs such as Inferno Nijmegen,Club Havana Utrecht, TWSTD Amsterdam and The Hollywood Music Hall Rotterdam. At this moment he is free to play where ever he likes playing a deep funky sound with a lot of latin influences and catchy vocals \r\n\r\nRakesh: \r\n\r\nRakesh started his DJ career at the age of 8! At this young age, he began buying 12 inch records at the local record store where his brother frequently bought his own records. Because his brother was a drive-in DJ, Rakesh was able to experiment with all sorts of music and by listening to all of it, he created his taste in music. By discovering the pitch-control on the turntables, he started to create his own Ragga, R&B and hiphop mixes. When the 90’s introduced ‘Turn up the base’, his passion developed from just hiphop, to a mixture of hiphop and electronics put together. Over the years, house music took it’s own turns. From acid house to hip-house, from rave to break beats. Throughout these years, Rakesh began to discover that vocals where very important in house music. At least in his house music. Nowadays Rakesh performs his DJ skills in several clubs in the Netherlands and already represented his sound at big dutch clubs such as Manhattan, The level, Club Ohmsu, Club Purple, Luxor Live, Hollywood Music Hall and Fred& Douwe, where he rocks the dance floors by playing Soulful Deephouse combined with Tech House beats. Rakesh produces his own tracks, where soulful vocals run the rhythm. 100% body movement guaranteed!",

Delft is also stated as the royal city because of its great history it has with the royal family. Eddy started DJ-ing at the age of 19 after visiting a party of Dutch DJ legend Tiesto. From that moment on Eddie was hooked by the melodic trance tunes flowing all over and started spinning the wheels himself. When buying records Eddie soon made his favorite sound a bit more sophisticated and slower and turned over to the progressive side of the trancy house sound. DJ’s such as Sasha and John Digweed really made the perfect combination of melancholic tunes combined with a diversity of flashy sounds and on-going pumping beats.\r\n\r\nFriends know Eddie for his friendly & loving character and yet this influence came by the guys of Deep Dish and Hernan Cattaneo. It’s the ‘vocal thing’ that makes Eddie a special DJ to listen to. He created a combination of sounds into his own making the people feel warm and loving yet still wanting to dancing their asses off.\r\n\r\nNowadays he’s spinning all over a variety of party locations on the west side of Holland. Claiming a residency at the Firma Gezellig Party Concept Organization (eatNjoy & Dansen aan Zee) where he forms a perfect team with his DJ collegue and friend Reinier Bergsma.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Eddie’s DJ name ‘Steelo’ is rising and more often he is asked to give the party people a special night out. Spinning with the likes of Remy, Matthew Dekay, Dimitri and rising star Warren Fellow, this 25 year young talent has set 2007 to make a prosperous year full of interesting bookings and making own record productions.\r\n\r\nDJ appearances oa\r\nOff-Corso\r\nClub zonder Concessies\r\nStudio 80\r\nFree Your Mind Festival\r\nTe Smerig ( pand 48 )\r\nClub Catwalk Rottedam\r\nMaassilo Rotterdam\r\nTwstd Amsterdam\r\nElements beach\r\nKaravaan\r\nSpeakers Delft\r\nStrand aan de Maas Rotterdam\r\nSlam FM (Radio Show)",

With his own releases Sinfol keeps on forging unique moods which he fuses with energizing dancefloor orientated textures, building suspense by utilizing specific aspects of human emotion, resulting in a finely crafted and enthralling sonic experience.\r\n\r\nAs a DJ Sinfol has proven to be as intriguing as his productions. He’s holding a residency at the acclaimed Reaktor Events since 2013 where he developed his musical knowledge and intuitive selection. Constantly striving to let go of a narrow framework, his style blends classic machine funk with modern day drive, bright light with profound dejection. The growing recognition for this palette resulted in a quick gain of momentum on the international stage with gigs across Europe. \r\n\r\nWith everything that has happened over the course of 2 years, there is no doubt that Sinfol’s sound will traverse the globe.",

After all, if you’re able to count the heads of some of Holland’s finest labels, including Balans and Dynamic Reflection, and the likes of Laurent Garnier, ROD and Dimi Angélis among your fans, you’ve obviously been doing something right.\r\n\r\nHis relative anonimity isn’t something that troubles the Amsterdam-based producer and live-act however. More than willing to invest time (the man literally lives in his studio), Stefan has little love for a rushed approach. His path, unlike that of many, hasn’t lead from playing records to eventually taking on music production. Instead, after discovering work by personal inspirations like Rachmad, Surgeon and Mills, Stefan put his own creativity to work.\r\n\r\nNow, with a good amount of solid techno releases under his belt, the urge to translate his music to a live audience has followed. Again however, those expecting thought-out predictability are likely to be disappointed. In a sense Stefan’s live-act, consisting of only his own material, is a sneak peek into his studio. A highly danceable one that is, with ample room deliberately left open for  live, on the spot re-interpretation.\r\n\r\nSo far Stefan’s career has seen him play certainly not the least of venues, including Doornroosje, Paradigm, Simplon and HAL 16. His release schedule does its own equally impressive name-dropping. Included on the list are Dynamic Reflection, Manual and soon Darko Esser’s Balans is set to follow.\r\n\r\nPut together, it’s pretty hard not to come to the conclusion that this year might just be his year.",

He made a real sport out of becoming an expert in different genres, whether it concerns R&B, Hip Hop, Salsa, Reggae or Pop music. Also, he's great in working with talented rappers and singers, adding the right sound to voice and character.Though their unassuming characters might show of differently, the brothers are very eager when it comes to their musical career.

He made a real sport out of becoming an expert in different genres, whether it concerns R&B, Hip Hop, Salsa, Reggae or Pop music. Also, he's great in working with talented rappers and singers, adding the right sound to voice and character.\r\n \r\nIn 2006 Sergio expanded his production knowledge even more by taking a special training at the SAE (School of Audio Engineering) in Amsterdam. After successfully finishing the course 'Electronic Music Production', he is considered as musical as technical. Nowadays, Sergio is capable of producing his music from start until the very last phase. With these qualities in hand, he managed to lift his activities to an even higher level, which has been proven often in clubs with perfectly sounding tracks.\r\n \r\nInspired by the musical talent of his older brother, young Orpheo started working with Propellerhead Reason in 2004. Soon he created his own sound and only a few years later the first steps to success were already made. In 2007 Orpheo saw his first release come out on the popular Dutch download portal Dance Tunes. The track is called \"Invasion\", a team production made in corporation with Lucky Charmes. It is a very good reflection of Orpheo's style, with a raw, bubbling rhythm and high electronic beeps that are bowed and twisted in all different directions. The track combines house with minimal influences, which makes it very original!\r\n \r\nTo use his creativity in the right way, Orpheo found a great mentor in Sergio. His guidance made him able to give more quality to his projects, and soon Sergio recognized a great talent in his younger brother. Working together turned out to be a smart move which eventually led to a special remix job for the famous DJ Chuckie in 2008. With this reference Sergio & Orpheo are about to force a serious breakthrough in the Dutch dancescene, and it's a simple fact that we are about to hear much more from these gifted producers. \r\nSo. stay tuned for the Popken brothers! Once you catch them live, make sure to finish your drink first, because with Sergio & Orpheo in the house, things are about to get messy! \r\n",

His first contact with the world of music was not headphones and turntables but the piano, which he began learning at the tender age of 8. However, Anthony would soon leave the world of piano music behind and develop an interest in electronic music.

His first contact with the world of music was not headphones and turntables but the piano, which he began learning at the tender age of 8. However, Anthony would soon leave the world of piano music behind and develop an interest in electronic music. Despite his great love of music, Anthony never dreamt of pursuing a career in the music world, orienting himself instead towards a degree in business studies. “Like in any industry, if you work hard and persevere in your beliefs, things come. I guess this stems from my father and I thank him for that and much more.”\r\nIt is this determination and at the same time, talent, honesty and integrity which has won Anthony many friends and fans. Inspired by the influences from the simplistic early 90s sound of electronica, Anthony has moulded his own style and presence with his vivid and continually provocative driving sounds of High Tech Soul! These various shades of techno are built for peak-time dance floors as well as some cooler moments and always getting the crowd going.\r\nHis tracks and remixes are played by many DJs and on radio programs and he is currently working on several new releases. “I really enjoy the residency nights where people are coming to hear me play. This gives me a great boost to perform and make sure they get what they came for. But playing at a venue or club I have not played before is even more thrilling for me. There is possibly a new audience and you only get one chance to make a first impression.”",

They founded the project in early 2008 and since have been playing across various events in the Dutch dance scene. \r\nLate 2010 they established, together with other international DJ's and producers living in the Netherlands, \"Origenes\", a platform designed to express creativity and to promote upcoming talents. As resident DJ’s, under the name \"Origenes\" they are organizing successful parties in Amsterdam. \r\n\r\nWhat began as a bit of fun between two friends turned to become long musical sessions, slowly bringing them closer to finding a sound of their own: electronic stories full of hard, powerful and unusual arrangements. Dragos and Alex share the passion for techno music and love spending time in their studio in Amsterdam. Lately they have been busy with music production and Alex recently released a collaboration album on \"MinimoRecords\", a South-American label with influence in the clubbing scene. \r\n\r\nTheir involvement in music started from a very young age, growing up in an environment where music was always present. Being genuinely curious about the mechanics behind the sounds they were listening, they've self-taught in music production/DJing software and gadgets. They are absolutely crazy about new technology and exploring the possibilities it creates. Often they humorously regard themselves as \"geeks\". \r\n\r\nSonocracy will continue to channel their vision, passion, and love of music into all that they do and all that will come in their productions.\r\n",

At this time he also recorded dance mixes with a casetterecorder, which he would listen over and over again. When he received a copy of Magix Music Maker, his first steps in computer music were made.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he switched to Cubase, which gave him much more freedom. As a breakdancer, he was mostly making hiphop beats, until a classmate in high school introduced him to James Holden and his Border Community label. He was listening the same mixes over and over again, and they would never bore him. He quickly gave up hiphop and started making electronic dance music. At this time he switched to Ableton, which he now still uses, in the studio and on stage.\r\n\r\nHis sound can be described as dreamy and euphoric techno. His newer work is more dance floor orientated, while still maintaining this melodic sound. His influences are Nathan Fake, Ricardo Tobar, Max Cooper, James Holden, Gui Boratto, 10dens, Margot, Applescal, Mathew Johnson, Extrawelt, Luke Abbott, Avus, Moderat, Ryan Davis, Apparat, Caribou, Jesse Somfay, Kate Wax, Pivot/PVT, Matthys, Radiohead, Muse ... and many more.\r\n\r\nWhen performing live he uses all kinds of controllers to control and perform his own music on the fly, enabling him to improvise and interact with the audience.",

These days he is a game changer as a promoter and adds an uplifting and accessible vibe to the dj line-up as an artist, sharing his parties and gigs with the biggest names of the industry.\r\n\r\nIt are a vigorous passion for electronic music that pulses in every fiber of his body and above all a Calvinistic approach to his labor, delivering no nonsense hard work, that brought him from the kick-start of his career as a dj in 1997 to where he stands today. Being the promoter of CLICK he shares the stage edition after edition with the most relevant names of the industry, carefully guarding the atmosphere of his parties. But when it comes to the key to the stunning success story of CLICK his own dj sets can not be dismissed. He brings a contagious mix of house, deep and tech, with positive energy and a big smile on his ever happy face. From beats that set the pace of electronic music forward to the epic records that forever shaped the scene as we know it today. Stefano Richetta spins them into a convincing and flowing story and keeps the boys and girls in front of him energized on the dance floor. A true dj, who continuously seeks interaction with his audience, the location and the artists around him, steering each party steadily to the right level and in good spirits. His musical signature, the parties he organizes and his persona listen to the words friendly, honest and epic. The kind of artist people love to be entertained by, organizations want to cooperate with and everybody likes to see coming back.\r\n\r\nStefano Richetta, a dj who happens to also be the promoter of the techno parties that set the tone of today’s party scene. An asset giving him the overall vision of a winner on all fields. He speaks the international language that communicates with the crowd, the staff, the organization and his fellow artists with a disarming attitude. His resume consists of the events that matter, with the likes of Awakenings, Mystery Land, Free Your Mind Festival, Dance Valley and Twstd among them. He knows everybody and everybody knows Stefano Richetta. In his role as a promoter he keeps pushing the limits with the CLICK and Express editions. As a dj he embodies the concept of the party. An ambassador of the Dutch party scene who righteously can claim this title and a valuable addition to every party that wants to keep the spirits alive and the juices flowing. Keeping the fun, passion and love in the game.",

Too young to enter the clubs, Stefan did so anyway. Scouting all the mainstream electronic scenes at an age of 15, Stefan absorbed all the styles he could find. At age 16 he discovered the dutch free-party scene and it was here where Stefan found the ultimate setting for his music.\r\nIt’s 1998 when Stefan started DJing/producing and a year later he teamed up with his friends to start their unique brand of free-party: ZMK Soundsystem. In 2000 Stefan was already a notorious vinyl collector and he was one of the members to start the ZMK record label, which contributed even more to ZMK’s european succes. Stefan’s tracks were featured on the first 2 EP’s, which sold out within several months. Stefan has performed at countless free-parties all over Holland and Europe, promoting the dutch unique brand of acid, hardtek and hardcore.\r\n\r\nOver the years Stefan has not forgotten his roots, and the integration of different styles (breakbeats, electro, techno, rave) became more and more evident. While his style really started to develop, his number of solo-bookings at clubs and parties exploded, including most mayor venues in Holland and touring through Europe regulary. With over 15 years of experience, he is considered to be the most booked dutch DJ of the free-party movement.\r\n\r\nBut his development does not stop there. With the rise of Ableton Live and Traktor Scratch, Stefan has found the tools to incorporate all that is good in electronic music into his mindbendig sets. Mixing obscure elements, custom remixes with the freshest beats available, digital and analog. What was considered to be impossible, now sits waiting at his fingertips! Are you ready?\r\n\r\n“My mixing is about creating deep atmosphere mixed with uplifting energy. The styles i like to fuse are Acidcore, Hardtechno, Mental hardcore, Industrial, IDM/Breaks and a hint of Rave. To enhance the fusion i create my own custom edits of old tracks and the occasional mashups.”",

  "artist_bio": "After more than a quarter of a century involved in electronic music, it’s not an exaggeration to say that Steve Rachmad has been integral to the development of the scene in his native Netherlands. Most often associated with Detroit techno, its warm pads, rousing strings and powerful grooves, Steve is the producer, remixer and DJ who among first championed such sounds in his home country.\r\n\r\nAmongst his earliest achievements was releasing the full length Secret Life of Machines back in 1995. A definitive techno album that was very much an instant classic from Rachmad (under his STERAC alias), 2012 sees it getting touched up, slowed down and remixed by the likes of Ricardo Villalobos, Joris Voorn and more.Mentioning releases, remixes or labels on which Steve Rachmad has shown his craftsmanship, or boasting about clubs and festivals on which he has left his mark, would just make for another list of names, places and brands…. Let’s not do that. Feel free to visit the usual channels such as Discogs, Soundcloud or Beatport and take your pick of the numerous productions and DJ sets, which are the result of more than two decades of dedication, sweat, and the polishing of a one of a kind talent…\r\n\r\nBecause as Miles had his horn and Pablo took to canvas, Steve has an unequalled gift for making a connection with every thinkable drum machine and synthesizer out there… If the man had kids, boys would carry names as Roland or Robert (Moog), and a girl would surely be named Linn, after the machine made famous by Prince in the 80’s. No wonder one of his major achievements is the album Secret Life Of The Machines. Released in 1995, the force of this piece still lingers on today, resulting in last years re-release with remixes by people like Ricardo Villalobos, Joris Voorn and Marc Romboy… For music to have this kind of a timeless value is a rare thing in the current electronic music scene.\r\n\r\nAs a DJ he is constantly reinventing himself. Set firmly in the best that techno and house have to offer at the moment he draws inspiration from his love for high quality disco and electro from the past. A thing you can clearly hear in the four-hour set he did at Berlin’s Panoramabar last year. \r\n\r\nAs words can never describe the feeling one gets from good music we will end here advising you to go check him out and hear for yourself what Steve is all about.",

  "artist_bio": "Style Beats Liberation Front is a DJ from the South of the Netherlands and plays electro music, which sounds like The Ramones’ distortion with Daft Punk’s tunes and the dance-steps of Elvis. All of this with a spot of raw disco, the kind that Saturday Night Fever didn’t dare to dream about. With their conviction that dance music is not solely dark bass-lines and tricky high-hats, that put a lot more in his mixes: from screaming guitars to pounding drums! This is how he spreads his own interpretation a sex, drugs & rock ‘n roll!\r\nMusic is for Style Beats Liberation Front more than just mixing the right tracks. With his conviction that dance music is not solely dark bass-lines and tricky high-hats, that put a lot more in their mixes: from screaming guitars to pounding drums! This is how Bart spreads his own interpretation a sex, drugs & rock ‘n roll!\r\n\r\nAnd guess what, he’s getting much appreciation for doing just that. He’s been spreading his musical ideas before as a steady part of the CampingDisco (Eenheidsworst) party-tour and in venues like Effenaar Eindhoven, 013 Tilburg, Ekko Utrecht, Club 8 Amsterdam, Extrema’s Solar Weekend, StudioCamping Westergasfabriek Amsterdam, Hangar 20 Breda, to name just a few. Style Beats shared stages with Beesmunt, BoemKlatsch, Crookers, Dem Slackers, Eric De Man, Joost van Bellen, LeLe, Lustige Lola & Weltschmerz, Mightyfools, Nobody Beats the Drum, The Longmen, the Subs, The Walk & RogerSeventyTwo and many more...\r\n\r\nNext to spreading this musical ideology, Bart has been involved in the Dutch music scene for years now. Currently he is organizing party’s like DR’OP in Eindhoven (together with Hank Long) and Hangar 20’s Aerial Club in Breda (together with Cursed P).\r\n\r\nDuring his energetic DJ-sets, Style Beats Liberation Front supplies a healthy dose of enthusiasm, beats and audience-interaction. The chemistry between the DJ and the crowd results in a steady start and a booming climax, which fits right in the evenings line-up!\r\n",

Well known and appreciated in his district.Whether being a magician on decks or in the studio DJ/Producer Timmy Overdijk (1978) is redrawing boundaries between House, Techno, Pop and Electronica.\r\n\r\nWith a credential of turntableing since 1994 under his earlier alter- ego DJ T.M., he played among sides of the Dutch nation greatest DJ’s until 2006 and made his comeback as a producer in 2011, releasing his debut on the Compresmode label.\r\n\r\nPassionate he is about music, the DJ holds residential seats at C.O.R. Private party’s ( Compresmode/ Basement) and at Poppodium Nieuwe Nor (Nominee best Dutch Popstage 2012) promoting “Zwartkrijt & friends labelnights” under the concept of the “ Soort Zoekt Soort friends –art and music collective “ and claiming audience with his different dazzling style. Yet Tim’s fans know describing his music is not an easy task.\r\n\r\nQuality fit, a specific dynamic core sound can be found in all his productions, but the music changes frequently, like his love to experiment with the sour and sweet.\r\nFrom pop/synth releases to crowdpleasers for the dancefloor, his tunes are always elegant or powerful but do not fit the most expected paths, making him a true artist.\r\n\r\nIn 2013 the artist founded the recordlabel Zwartkrijt (2013) , cooperating with musicblogger salsa-at-night and made his first releases successfully ,gaining support by the likes of SLAM and Paco Osuna among many others. A new monthly electronic radio show from his label Zwartkrijt is aired on Strom:kraft radio (CH) starting October 2013, revealing hot mixes from the artist himself and musical talents worldwide, spreading his love for the electronic genre.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.beatport.com/artist/tim-overdijk/201711 \r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/TimmyOverdijk\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/deejaytimoverdijk",

From the beginning they felt a certain bond, and decided to join forces. On their first joint party, the two of them started a spontaneous back2back session. This set went down so well, others were soon to follow. It would be the start of a long lasting musical alliance between Sven & Tettero.\r\n\r\nThree years down the line, the future is looking brighter than ever. Tettero is organizing parties in Amsterdam, Haarlem, Zandvoort and Bloemendaal, while Sven is rapidly evolving as a gifted producers. Thanks to their residency for RUSH, Sven & Tettero played prime spots in most of the country’s leading clubs and festivals. Meanwhile, booking requests from the underground rave scene keep pouring in. From being two local heroes in Haarlem, the guys are now operating on a national level.\r\n\r\nMusically, Sven & Tettero have also developed rapidly. Growing up with disco influences and shaped by the classic house sound, the two of them are now a multi-talented, border-crossing tandem. They seemlessly mix anything from house to disco, and from electro to techno, never failing to present a captivating chunk of dance music. Sven & Tettero are guaranteed to set floors aflame, without sticking to one particular style.\r\n\r\nThis wide variety of styles is also reflected in their exotic agenda. As klinch residents in Melkweg they’re frequently lined up alongside a variety of superstars, ranging from Dizzee Rascal to Plump DJ’s and Ben Westbeach (with whom they have been known to play back2back2back sets). They are also known to rock the more intimate parties like Vrijbuiters, Dekmantel and Electronation – does it get any more versatile? No wonder they were booked for Lowlands this year, where they warmed up for none other than Air and Groove Armada in the Bravo tent (capacity: 8000).\r\n\r\nOnly to create a casual beachvibe the next weekend at Woodstock69. No problem for the guys, who like to keep things exciting for themselves and for their crowd. If you want to know how all of this sounds, check out Sven & Tettero’s Soundcloud account with tens of various mixes. Hearing is believing!\r\n\r\n\r\nBookings: niels@earthbookings.nl",

Inspired by a diversity of other musicians, producers, dj’s and the things that happen in “normal” life. A very important dutch man gave him so much inspiration to find his real techno sound. His name is Jochem Paap aka Speedy J. Steve started to produce tracks at a very young age. Over the years he produced different kinds of techno and tech house tunes. His style can be best described as very energetic raw techno. Lots of sound editing and weird and crazy effects to create a certain atmosphere in his tracks, while the rhythm keeps on going and going like a machine. He also did some great dj performances for organisations like Qdance, UDC and other smaller ones. A couple of years later he was asked to perform a live set. He grabbed the first edition of Ableton Live and started to create a live set. He instantly had the intension to create a dynamic set. This was a very tough goal to reach. But with hundreds of loops and sounds he’d created over the years, he was able to do it. His style of performing a live set is hypnotic and driving techno, it keeps you going for hours. A live set without pre-programmed parts. In every set you will recognize his sound, but the arrangements are always different, in order to create the best sounds and atmosphere on stage.",

Five years later at the age of ..Steven Pieters (1983) was born in Etten-Leur (Netherlands) but soon after moved to a Rotterdam suburb. His interest in electronic dance music started to grow at the tender age of ten. Heavily influenced by the older kids in his neighborhood, who were already into mixing house records, he bought his first set of turntables in ’95 when he was only twelve. Five years later at the age of seventeen, he was one of the resident DJ’s at a very gritty Rotterdam based after party club, quickly learning the tools of the trade. Nowadays he plays his music in clubs and festivals throughout Europe and is one of the tastemakers of the Dutch underground house scene. Although it’s hard to stick a certain label to his sound, it can be best described as a forward thinking blend of everything deep and funky. Whether playing solo or back to back with his partner in crime Khalil, he holds a reputation for bringing warm and soulful sounds with a distinct freaky edge and a powerful hypnotic groove.\r\n\r\nCurrently Steven is spearheading Triphouse Rotterdam, a collective of creative people from the city of Rotterdam who share a common love for house music with a psychedelic touch. The collective operates from their recordstore located in the west side of the city, that functions as a communal gathering space for the local scene. Together they also runs several club nights and festivals, two radio shows and the Triphouse Rotterdam label. With these activities Steven plays a vital role in maintaining a much needed platform for contemporary electronic music in his hometown. His little spare time is spent in the studio working on his own productions that have surfaced on labels such as Wolfskuil Ltd, Kindisch and Grammafoon over the last years. On a shorter notice: keep an eye out for this enthusiastic and highly motivated house freak, soon to be setting fire to a dance floor near you!\r\n\r\nDiscography:\r\nKhalil & Steven P – Crooswijk RIP EP (Grammafoon)\r\nCombinator – Tranq (Steven Pieters remix) (Manual)\r\nSteven Pieters – Acid Sunset (Wolfskuil Ltd)\r\nSteven Pieters – Concorde To Honolulu (Kindisch)\r\nSteven Pieters – Don't Try To Understand It EP (Triphouse Rotterdam)\r\n\r\nSome festivals, clubs and parties where Steven performed:\r\nDimensions Festival (Croatia), Awakenings, Free Your Mind Festival, Solar Weekender Festival, Extrema Outdoor (Belgium), Sensation White, Your Time NYE (Turin), Slakthuset (Stockholm), Off Sonar (Barcelona), Chalet (Berlin), Have A Nice Day Festival, Sira (Jerusalem), Free Funk Festival, Dockhouse Festival, Pakhuis, Graefenthal Am See Festival (Germany), Brandend Zand Festival, Costa del Soul Festival, Maassilo, Trouw, Watt, Supperclub, Amsterdam Dance Event, Off Corso, Doornroosje, MS Stubnitz, Kruthuset (Stockholm), Studio 80, Tivoli, Rotterdam Electronic Music Festival, Sugar Factory, Dekmantel, Drift Festival, Catwalk, Poly Vinyl Club (Barcelona), Nighttown, Escape, Melkweg, Paradiso, Woodstock 69 amongst hundreds of others.",

After a brief adventure as a singer in a metal band, Melvin van Pelt hit the club circuit. As a real “career tiger” he worked his way up from glass threader to bartender to club photographer.\r\n\r\nFrom his experiences in the nightlife the interest in dance music and techno in particular grew. After a good friend gave him his first set of techno records and a subsequent party with Ricardo Villalobos, Tahko fell in love, was sold and enslaved to dance music.\r\n\r\nAfter some experimenting with producing music Tahko was asked to play at a new years party. And as of December 31, 2010 Tahko took on DJ-ing and he’s got no intention of stopping.\r\n\r\nAlthough he only started performing quite recently, Tahko left a significant impression in the Amsterdam scene. ThuisHaven, Lazy Sundays, Crossovers and Klamme Handjes are just a few parties where his infectious enthusiasm has left the crowd wanting more.\r\n\r\nTahko already played alongside big names like Luna City Express, Gabriel Ananda, Mauro picotto and Felix the Housecat\r\n\r\nHe leaves a special impression behind every time he performs. His main objective is to entertain and that is the key factor in his shows, he is a slave of his crowd; ‘They are in charge of the night’.\r\n\r\nAt this moment producing music is gaining his interest again and Tahko was invited to release on starting deep house label midi8or. He is set to release a remix for PatriceVanDenBerg and will also release his first EP soon, titled “Musical Journey EP”!",

In 1996 he started buying records and developed his mixing and musical skills. Soon he began playing for audiences in small clubs in Haarlem. One of his first residencies was and still is at Club Stalker (Haarlem).\r\n\r\nClub Stalker has always been an inspiring club where new styles of dance music can be heard in its early beginning, and where special foreign djs can be heard. In 2005 Sven started organising his own night at Club Stalker together with friend and DJ Gijs Tettero, called 'Vastgoed', and later on he organised 'Haarlem Beeft'.\r\n\r\nIn Amsterdam Sven organizes cultural parties named Club Cult. Writers, poets, actors and classical musicians together with djs inspire eachother, creating the unexpected.\r\n\r\nSven regularly plays at clubs and venues like Trouw, Melkweg, Paradiso, Westerunie, Doornroosje, Patronaat, Studio 80 and Woodstock69. Festivals he cracked were Lowlands, Rockit, Welcome To The Future, Mysteryland, Lovelandand Amsterdam Open Air. Sven's sound can be best described as a mix of raw house and techno. The term recordfreak suits him well with checking loads of records online and offline every week. His intention is to always create an energetic dance floor and to make clubbing a special experience to people.\r\n\r\nBesides that Sven spends a lot of his time in the studio, so watch out for his releases this year!\r\n\r\nFor bookings: lisette@squarebookings.com\r\n",

As goes for the architecture of Rotterdam, Taras is always looking for new ways to find an innovative sound. This didn’t go unnoticed by the house en technoscene.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of years spinning the decks in the underground scene he started producing in 2007. Warm melodies, effective bass lines and crazy breaks. He’s been then taking things seriously in his studio. His way of producing has led to some surprising results. So it’s almost impossible to put his sound in a genre. In the end it’s all about the result; a ecstatic dancefloor.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe released a series of Eps and remixes on Manual, Stolen Moments, Exceptional and Mood Music. The release of tracks such as ‘Skylime” on Wolfskuil (co.production with Jelle Kuipers) and “1998” on Rebirth/EC served as a springboard for remixes and attention from international Dj’s like Pete Tong, Richie Hawtin, Agoria, Luciano and a lot of other keyplayers. The tracks have been on number one of the Juno and the Resident advisorcharts for weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the last years he has built up his (inter)national reputation by playing at the major clubs and festivals in Europe. Awakenings, Dancevalley, Paradiso, Club 11, Doornroosje, Barcelona (Raum), Londen (The Egg), Antwerpen (Cafe d'Anvers) and Milaan to name a few. His sets are very different from your average DJ. You only have to witness the queues of enthousiasts in front of the Catwalk in Rotterdam where he held long-term residencies. Especially on his long sets. Mellowing his style as times goes by, getting more experimental and spacious with a fresh style of his own. It’s clear that Taras is has made his name in the music scene and his is ready for the next step.For more Information about Taras van de Voorde\r\n\r\nwww.myspace.com/djtaras\r\nwww.soundcloud.com/taras-van-de-voorde\r\nwww.twitter.com/tarasvdvoorde\r\nwww.facebook.com/pages/Taras-van-de-Voorde/47074958986?ref=ts",

They first were introduced to music at their cousin’s, who had a DJ set with house vinyl. In the beginning they got instructions from their cousin and 1 year later they had their own DJ set. The music that they played was house music. They wanted to find out where house came from and so they got busy doing their own research. Exploring local vinyl shops in Amsterdam and buying house vinyl to hear and learn from more producers. \r\nDuring that time they listened to big producers like Roger Sanchez, Hollis P Monroe, Jean Jacques Smoothie, Kerri Chandler and Daft Punk.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of years of listening to different styles of house, they had set their heart and sound into 1 style, Soulful/Beach house music.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 they had landed their first gig. Their first gigs were in cafes and clubs in Amsterdam and outside.\r\n\r\nTo name a few: \r\n-Main room of the Marcanti Amsterdam \r\n-Groove to chill with Michel De Hey, Zeeland \r\n-TWSTD Cafe, Amsterdam \r\n-Holland Casino, Amsterdam \r\n-Dream Spinners, Amsterdam\r\n\r\nIn 2009 the brothers decided to form a DJ group called “Teo Brothers”.\r\n\r\nIn 2010 they got the chance to play at big events and from then on, they got a residency in Rico’s, Ijmuiden. They played alongside Gregor Salto, Brian S, Dennis Ferrer(US), Gene Farris(US), Victor Coral and Ricky Rivaro.\r\n\r\nThe last years they are getting along with Ableton and making house productions in their own style. \r\nIn 2011 they signed a contract with 7 stars music. Their debut release Teo Brothers – “Summer at the beach” with vocal of Saga Bloom got a lot of very good and positive feedback. They even got a response from their idol DJ/producer Roger Sanchez.\r\n\r\n3 months later the second release under 7 stars music’s wing was called Teo Brothers – “The Good Days” with remixes of FiguDs and Mickey Destro. This one was a huge success in the summer of 2011.\r\n\r\nNow the Teo Brothers have releases on: Randall Records(UK), BigGrooveRecords(UK), Punky Records, 666 Recordings(Colombia) and Vethmusic.\r\n\r\nTheir new release on Vethmusic was played on Fresh FM by DJ Jurgen. The release on Randall Records was used by Luis Del Villar – Ibiza Sensation podcast as openings track.\r\n\r\nNow the Teo Brothers have their own radio show on Posh FM in London.\r\n\r\nWatch out for the Teo Brothers for the releases and upcoming gigs.",

I was always really interested in it, but I couldn’t find a way to dig in to it. I thought, this is the best way to express my feelings and emotions and to create a sort of story that I want to tell, not only in DJ sets, but also in producing. I noticed that people understand you with music not only with words. In the last couple of years I developed my taste, and I found out that I want to go deeper in the sounds and learn how to create a more perfect story, and I can do this with a big focus on my myself and music that I really like. I like to combine dance (like in clubs) with music for easy listening.",

  "artist_bio": "Music has always been the biggest passion in DJ Tiësto's life and he felt the need to share that passion with other people. Between 1985 and 1993 he performed as a resident in several clubs in Holland and in these years he developed an important foundation.Together with Arny Bink he founded tge record company Black Hole Recordings which provides the world with all sorts of quality dance music. On Black Hole Tiësto has his own Magik and In Search Of Sunrise Series, which are very succesful all over the globe. He also mixed the first two Space Age volumes, and most recently Nyana.\r\n\r\nHis remix of Delerium Featuring Sarh McLachlan - The Silence was the first house track ever broadcasted on daytime radio in northe america and was four weeks in the U.K. top 10 chart. In 2001 Tiësto started a new sublabel, MAGIK MUZIK which is providing the world with Tiësto's finest productions and his favourite tracks. The first releases were the 2001 anthems Flight 643 and his long awaited artist album In My Memory, and lately massive anthems from Umerk, Mark Norman and Mr Sam vs. Fred Baker. Summer 2002 Black Hole Recordings UK is born, a sister company set up to service the english market. After winning almost every dance related award in 2002 a crown was put on his career by being voted the number 1 DJ in the world in DJ Magazine's top 100.\r\n\r\nThe year 2003 has been a year filled with highlights. Tiësto is now officially the first DJ in the world ever to sell out a stadium event with a solo performance for over 25.000 people. Like Nyana, the Tiësto In Concert DVD has reached the gold status, same for the hitsingle Traffic which is the first instrumental track to reach the numner 1 chart position in 23 years. In 2003 Tiësto has won 3 TMF awards (Holland & Belgium), 2 Dutch DJ awards, one MTV holland award, and was again number 1 in DJ Magzine's top 100, first time a DJ got this spot twice in a row!",

It was there that he developed his preference for progressive disco, mixed with the queer-, vogue-, house-, internet- and electro-influences that have made you jump / vogue / shuffle / twerk for the last three years. \r\n\r\nFrom clubs like NYX, Paradiso and Trouw in Amsterdam, The Stress quickly found his way to international venues such as Razzmatazz in Barcelona, The Other Party in Kuala Lumpur and Brussels' notorious Los Ninos parties.

His techno productions appeared under the names REC (Djax-upbeats) and Con Man (P.i.a.s.), while more melodic techno music was released under the aliases Terrace (Djax, Eevo Lute) and Florence. He also records experimental music under the name Sierra Romeo.\r\n\r\nThroughout the years, Stefan has carefully spread out his creativity over a number of musical alter egos. He saved his purest, most minimal productions for REC and Con Man, while the more accessible, melodic and melancholic techno was released under the Terrace name. Experiments with the Roland TB303 bass synthesizer found their place in the live shows and jam sessions of the Acid Junkies, together with Harold de Kinderen. With the Acid Junkies, Stefan played parties and festivals all over the world.\r\n\r\nAnd since 1992 he has operated Eevo Lute Muzique, a record company specializing in abstract and modern electronic music in its broadest form. The label has brought forth over 40 releases during recent years. After a refreshing pause in the period 1998 to 2001 the label resumed its activities last year, with renewed energy and lots of good music on the way! EevoNext is a fully digital web label emerging from the fundaments of Eevo Lute Muzique, one of the most influential techno labels from the Netherlands. Started in November 2006, it brings a bi-monthly release of a featured artist as a high quality download with emphasis on quality and playability. Available from the EEVONEXT.COM web store and established online stores like iTunes, Beatport and others.\r\n\r\nRobbers’ other projects include a concert with a 30-piece symphony orchestra in Jyvaskyla (Finland), a multimedia live show accompanied by video projections for the Tokyo based arts collective Ambient Web, Dutch National VPRO Televisions’ Moondive project and collaboration with a renowned Dutch theatre company for live music & acting performances.\r\n\r\nTo spread the word about his label and music, Stefan has developed an inspiring solo live set that he brings under his techno-alias Terrace. This varied musical performance kicks off in a melodic vein and gradually evolves into a total electronic dance music experience. The live set brings the audience an hour of energetic, funky electronic music: From Detroit to Eindhoven with a smile…",

The Scumfrog, an Amsterdam native and New York City transplant, has evolved his sound by combining the best from both sides of the Atlantic with a sophisticated blend of New York dark and rock-influenced beats and sexy European sounds. His recent successes include four no. 1 club hits; 2001's Ibiza anthem \"We Love You\" (Rolling Stones 60's cover), his remix of George Michael's single \"Freeek\", the billboard dance smash \"Love At First Sight\" by Kylie Minogue, and his re-conception of Dirty Vegas' \"Days Go By\". 2002 was an exciting year for The Scumfrog. Highlights included collaboration with David Bowie on Positiva, and DJ Gigs all over the world.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 2002, his new single \"Music Revolution\" was available for free download off his website for ten weeks. This generated enough play and publicity for the song to make a big impact during the 2003 Miami Winter Conference. The song is also featured on his compilation \"Extended Engagement\", which features 20 of his recent productions and remixes. \r\n\r\nThe Scumfrog DJ sets are not limited to mixing records. They include his live vocals, percussion, samples, visuals and occasional guest performances. The colorful live sets and consistently innovative productions landed him on the cover of DJ magazine in May 2003, and expose him frequently on Pete Tong’s BBC1 radio shows. On April 26th, the British station aired the first Scumfrog Essential Mix. \r\n\r\nFor over ten years, The Scumfrog (a.k.a. Jesse Houk) spread his distinctive sound in clubs throughout Europe. In 1997, the DJ and producer packed his record bags and brought his sound stateside to New York City. During the next two years, he released \"The Watersong\", (featured on Danny Tenaglia’s \"GU Athens\"), and the soulful single \"Learning To Fly\", which he signed to R*Senal records, the label of house music heavyweight Roger Sanchez. The Scumfrog and Sanchez toured together in 2001, and ever since, this Dutch born DJ/producer has been a familiar face behind turntables around the globe. \r\n\r\nAnnie Lennox, Monica, Missy Elliot, New Order and David Bowie are just some of the names that have recently undergone the Scumfrog’s remix treatment, and there are many to follow. When he is not remixing or producing other artists, he is working on his artist album, scheduled for completion in September.

Encounters with the anima, the shadow, the persona, the trickster and countless other archetypes all led up to the realization of the importance of the process of indivuation. \r\n\r\nThis eternal becoming of the Self carries within it a never ceasing confrontation with both painful and beautiful elements of Life Itself. Hoping that perhaps he can take along some listeners on a cerebral dancing journey to the center of their souls, Noyster has decided to dedicate himself to this thankful task under the slightly pretentious name of 'the Self'.",

  "artist_bio": "Techno from the north of The Netherlands.The Binary Mind (Christiaan van Tienhoven) is a techno performer and producer from Groningen, The Netherlands. Having released on and contributed to several labels like Naked Lunch, artists like Gary Beck describe his productions as “well produced with great energy”.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 2014 he founded the label Decoder Recordings, with its first release “The Bankrunner” planned for early 2015. There is a a clear vision about what the output of the label should be: “I founded Decoder Recordings as a platform for (but not limited to) releases as The Binary Mind, but generally for energetic, dance floor oriented techno. If it's quality techno and it breathes proper energy, it might be released.”\r\n\r\n“In 1990 I was seven years old, so I kind of grew up alongside the evolution of house music and many of its styles. However, techno was an undiscovered area until I went to university in Groningen. I started producing techno together with a friend (Daniel Plooster) in a period that many artists made their move to minimal techno. We had a healthy aversion against that development and we tried to create something different, utilizing those projects to explore production tooling and techniques.” It was how The Binary Mind as an act came alive, which was eventually continued only by Van Tienhoven, who produced the releases that made it to stores.\r\n\r\nWith the founding of Decoder Recordings, the release of “The Bankrunner” and upcoming contributions to other labels, the future looks very interesting from a musical perspective. “The current developments make it possible to expose my productions to a broader audience. It's what makes music satisfying and fun, and the latter stays the most important aspect in my opinion.”",

Often it’s not so much the groove that takes the lead in his music but the honest and romantic atmosphere that makes the sound of Thomas unique and graciously.\r\n\r\nSpotted by Nuno Dos Santos, Thomas Lauren began his musical journey in Utrecht. Starting with live performances, he developed quickly to be a known musician. The first track that was pressed on vinyl was ‘Hope’ on the Utrecht based label Dualblock Records. International recognition came when ‘Limit Life’ was released on the infamous dutch label Wolfskuil Records. The record got support from artists like Karotte and Ben Watt.\r\n\r\nBut since the release of ‘Waste No Time’ on King Fu, Thomas wants to let the world know that he is a hopelessly romantic and a thoughtful producer. The ideas of music Thomas has, are without any reservations or restrictions. So to do the thing he loves most, Thomas created, together with his musical friend Tundra, Savoir Records. They are releasing primary their own material, but the most important aspect of the label and music is that it comes from the heart. Savoir Records is trying to let the world know that innovative romantic electronic music exists. ‘Undefined Night’ was the first release on Savoir Records and it was an instant success. The track has been picked up by many DJ’s including Estroe. The second release of Thomas Lauren on Savoir, ‘Elevated Morning’ reached even one of the biggest DJ’s in the world, Sander Kleinenberg.\r\n\r\n",

Serving it up with big flair since 2007, they’ve rocked Amsterdam with a number of critically acclaimed, high profile parties and more memorable dj sets than they care to recall.\r\n\r\nToday the name of the game is housemusic and in Amsterdam, THE HEYKIDS are in a league of their own with a banging, versatile take on this most universal genre of dancemusic. Intensely inspired by loads of experience behind the decks, these guys know exactly what they want to play out for a crowd and are in the studio creating just that sound, expecting to start releasing it next year. Ahead of that, this year has seen THE HE..Things got started with the now-legendary Fightclub parties in 2007, where they hosted the likes of Ed Banger and Institubes crews, kick-starting the nu-rave electro hype for the lowlands. In the spring of 2008, they took up a challenge in organising the weekly wednesday night for the hottest club of the capitol, Studio 80. Within a year, Katapult was voted ‘Best New Party’ at the prestigious ‘Golden Gnome’ awards in poptemple Paradiso. Katapult serves up midweekmayhem for a diverse crowd of hipsters, hobos and hustlers united only in their will to party, plus a stunning lack of obligations the day after.\r\n\r\nFeeling the fresh intensity of the house groove, THE HEYKIDS rekindled the Fightclub fire with TAFKAF in 2009, going on a six-month tour de force with guests Boy 8-bit, New Judas crew, Duke Dumont, Justin Martin, Solo and Renaissance Man. Their point was not lost on the Amsterdam underground and beyond, firmly establishing the so-called midget house sound as the next big thing to jack the continent.\r\n\r\nAlthough they keep themselves well busy throwing parties, DJ’ing is what the heykids do best and love most. As a dj-team, the heykids have specialised in a number of upcoming styles and genres throughout their career - not being afraid to move away from established party music they’re always one step ahead of the game. Ask anyone who’s been on their dancefloor and survived: THE HEYKIDS DJS play quality music to make you lose your shit with a smile.

  "artist_bio": "The Man With No Shadow – shady name for a respectable dj. Gaining notoriety as co-founder and resident of the infamous GZG raves, he is now one of Holland’s most wanted technojocks. Representing the underground with a stern smile towards the mainstream, he’s winning over crowds across the Netherlands and beyond. A matter of timing or just a captivating choice of records? Who’s to say. Somehow The Man never fails to supply magical moments.The philosophy behind the GZG parties isn’t genre-based, but aimed foremost at capturing the ‘New House Feeling’. A whole new generation of underground clubbers has been inspired by these raves in old warehouses, on boats and in deserted factories. While crowds grew steadily over the last six years, so did the fanbase of promoter and dj The Man With No Shadow. As his organization was defying the authority’s regulations, he was breaking the rules of clubland from behind the decks. The Man has nourished an extraordinary blend of silk-mixed techno: patiently luring you into his aggressive grooves, he always finds the perfect moment to make the dancefloor explode with a surprising record.\r\n\r\nHis talents haven’t gone unnoticed. The Man has brought his musical passions to some of Holland’s most renowned clubs and festivals – highlights including main stage Mystery Land, Awakenings, Studio 80 and Trouw. Meanwhile GZG has gone legit, hosting area’s at major events like The Love Parade, and organizing it’s own festival in Amsterdam. The Man With No Shadow has become a household name for quality dance music, setting aflame the raunchiest of raveholes to some of the world’s leading events.\r\n\r\nMost recently, The Man’s focus has become more international – especially since he became an intercontinental resident for Sensation Deluxe (2008 – 2011). Headlining the second floor of the world’s largest travelling indoor event and touring thirteen country’s – including Portugal, Denmark, Russia and Spain – has not only strengthened his determination to conquer all corners of the Earth. It also proves that a great deejay isn’t defined by his productions, but by his ability to rock any given dance floor.\r\n\r\nFor bookings go to:  www.meanwhile.nl\r\n",

At some point, he came across Steinberg Remix which was actually a trimmed down version of Ableton Live. This is where it really started and the step to  Ableton Live was quickly made. Carefully growing his own way of producing and driven to get better as a live-act for over a decade, Tim is found in his studio everyday and without compromise.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, he joined team with C.O.R. and Tim Overdijk to setup the label Compresmode(.com) on which he released his first releases. In November 2012, Tim decided to make the step towards other labels. Since then many tracks are signed and will be released in the next few months. December 2012, his track “Window Apple” was staff picked by Traxsource.com on the 1st place of their “20 Essential Techno Tracks” and was additionally featured on the techno landing page. The second track on the EP “In the near Distance ft. Bibiche” got airtime on the Austrian national radio FM4.\r\n\r\nAltogether experimenting 13 years in the studio, Tim grew his own way of producing music. - far away from the present loop based culture. Tim composes and plays his music himself. Everything he creates is 100% original and in that way distinctive. Recently, Tim started studying harmony deeper. By this, his productions took a huge leap and these tracks will reach beatport in summer 2013. Expect live played organs over live played pianos over live played baselines - creating more dynamic than loop based productions can offer. This summer, Tim will also present his aka “Puur” with some very melodic works. The first EP release will be on Horatio’s well known Berlin label Natural Rhythm with recent releases and remixes by Tapesh, Alex Celler, Waff and many more.\r\n\r\nAs a DJ/live-act, Tim Deetakt brings the best of both worlds. Recent techouse and techno releases mixed in a harmonical journey combined with live/on the fly created remixes that lift the crowd! Baselines, melodies, beats, vocals - everything mixed together live with up to 6 tracks running simultaneously and all of this non pre-programmed. Each set brings something different and new. With all funky elements just one finger tap away, Tim Deetakt creates a continuous groove that will move the crowd!\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "140/170 all day everydayBio, written by Wil Benton\r\n\r\n\"Few facts about the origins of dubstep are widely accepted - but a few stand out in my mind as certainties. The fact that the sound originated from South London. The fact that the sound we know and love grew from the intersection of genres like dub/ reggae, grime and garage (to name a few) and the UK's Jamaican soundsystem culture. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“It's the latter that strikes me as the most important when listening to three Dutch producers who make music under 'The Illuminated' moniker. Dyzz, Rebus and Vence’s music reminds me of the early days of dubstep - with inspiration drawn from the same places as the sound’s forefathers. The trio may have only been producing together for a few years, but they’re quick on their way to joining the likes of Noisia, Icicle, Proxima and TMSV as internationally known and respected Dutch bass music producers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“I’ve been working with the trio since hearing ‘Scavenger’, one of their first productions caught the attention of Skream and Benga on Radio 1. Support from other big names quickly followed with the likes of Joe Nice, who’s often quick to rewind many an Illuminated tune,  Wheel & Deal's N-Type and Biscuit Factory Records' Walsh lining up to support The Illuminated’s music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“The next few months are a promising time for Yuri, Joep and Maarten. Since the early days and Radio 1 support, The Illuminated have released on Mu Djina, Underslung Audio, Iron Shirt Recordings and FatKidOnFire’s first compilation album, FKOFUn/Known01. ‘Scavenger’ also recently appeared on New Moon, alongside the brilliant TMSV remix, forming what was the first - but definitely won’t be the last - Illuminated vinyl release. The trio have a number of releases lined up for 2014, with an astounding new EP due out in March.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“International bookings will see Dyzz, Rebus and Vence take The Illuminated on a Poland tour, as well as their first ever visit to the UK later this year, bringing The Illuminated's take on a British - but global - sound to its birthplace for the first time. I, for one, can't wait.\"",

  "artist_bio": "The Moderator aka Klaas-Jan Jongsma is one of Holland?s most talented producers in the field of electronic dance music. He has a very personal, melodic and soulful style of music that combines the past with the future. His influences originate mainly in the birthplace of soulful techno music, Detroit Motor City in the USA. Earlier releases under various guises on Eevo Lute (Peninsula) and labels like Djax-up-Beats, Downlow Music, Keynote and AW-Recordings demonstrate his ability to grow with time whilst maintaining a very personal touch in his music. The Moderator also manages the well known techno music site www.technotourist.org and collaborates on projects with fellow musicians from the east part of Holland like East Island.The Moderator\r\n\r\nThe Moderator, aka Klaas-Jan Jongsma, is one of Holland’s most talented producers in the field of electronic dance music. He has a very personal, melodic and soulful style of music that combines the past with the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nKlaas-Jan caught on to electronic music at an early age, listening to a broad range of developing styles. He was thrilled by the emergence of house music and techno and fully immersed himself in these new musical forms. As a consequence he got interested in the creation of this fascinating music. He bought his first pieces of equipment and started experimenting. \r\n\r\nKJ also connected with a few other music enthusiasts in his area, the somewhat remote area of Almelo in the north-east of Holland. All the creative impulses amounted to KJ’s first releases under various guises such as Dash (Acid – Djax-Up-Beats), Peninsula (Detroit-influenced – Eevo Lute) and Megapurlz (Acid). Musical collaborations also surfaced, such as East Island, an ongoing project together with Peter and Tonie Vanderloon. \r\n\r\nKJ subscribed to ‘313’, a mailing list for the fans of electronic music from Detroit, techno in particular. He connected with like-minded souls from all over the planet. He also was the moderator of the Dutch counterpart of 313, the Lowlands list. This is where his artist name “The Moderator” originates.   \r\n\r\nIn December 1999 KJ made his first visit to Detroit, together with some Dutch friends such as Hans Veneman (TV99AD). At the 313 party the Dutch crew met tons of people they had spoken dozens of times in cyberspace, but never in real life. They were also lucky to hook up with some of their favorite artists. On one of these occasions an influential, but rather enigmatic figure of the music scene referred to them as ‘Techno tourists’ because he realized that they came to Detroit purely for the music and the city. The name stuck and a new chapter opened up in KJ’s musical journey, always following the beat…\r\n\r\nOn their return KJ and Hans decided to register Technotourist.org and put their pictures of Detroit online. The trip also inspired them to start bringing out music themselves. Otto Koppius started the label Ground Zero (later changed to Keynote) and a first Technotourist release featuring The Moderator, TV99AD and Thijz also surfaced. \r\n\r\n2000 became an important year in KJ’s musical development. The first DEMF, a three-day electronic music festival in downtown Detroit, was a major boost for KJ. It was an overwhelming celebration of KJ’s favorite music and he got in touch with even more like-minded souls, including the DownLow crew. He also met up with John Osselaer, a Belgian music enthusiast and freelance journalist who became part of the TT crew and started contributing to the website. Gradually TT.org evolved into an extensive information platform on Detroit techno and quality electronic music. \r\n\r\nThe consecutive years of the festival, the after-parties and personal contacts were a continuous inspiration for KJ. A first release on DownLow, ‘Sliding To Midnight’ came out, followed by the acclaimed ‘Interstate 5’ release on Keynote. A new collaboration with East Island saw the light of day. KJ became even more productive. On the ‘Modus Operandi’ ep, on his good friend Arne Weinberg’s label AW Recordings, he clearly shows his versatility and production skills. He also refined his live performance, which he has been doing since the early days of Dash.\r\n\r\nA visit to Detroit in 2004 with Stefan Robbers reinforced their friendship and got KJ involved in the development of the relaunched Eevo Lute label and website, together with Dj Estroe. This involvement also resulted in the release of ‘Reversed Evolution’. At present plans are being drawn for Eevo Lute showcases across the world, with KJ performing as The Moderator live, Stefan Robbers as Terrace live and dj Estroe.\r\n\r\n",

Now, a decade later, new names took over the scene like Justice, Uffie, SebastiaAn, Kavinsky Mr. Oizo, Teenage Bad Girl and of course label Kitsune. Besides all those Parisian party chrashers don’t be surprised if the Walk and Rogerseventytwo bring you some German Electro (Boys Noize, Digitalism etc), Favela Booty Beats, Baltimore Sound or even Michael Jackson.\r\n\r\nWith a friendship longer than ten years old and a same taste and interest in music The Walk and Rogerseventytwo started to work together in the summer of 2004. Wasn’t that the time that the DJ scene needed a new boost with a new sound? Yes indeed! And those two were ready for it. With great support of captain Joost van Bellen they both had the honour to perform together twice with Uffie and Feadz at Holland’s filthiest party Rauw where they soon became residents. Soon gigs followed in the Netherlands, (Paradiso with Justice and Gildas from Kitsune label) Tjech Republic (Plastique), Paris (Elegangz) and London on the Tiger Trax Label night. Since then they have a diverse list of gigs in and outside the Netherlands.\r\n\r\n2007 was the year that their baby WE LOVE… was born. Their own party night in one of the most outstanding clubs at this moment in the city off Amsterdam: The Flex Bar. Teenage Bad Girl, Les Petits Pilous, Aysam and Danger came to join the line-up in earlier successful editions. Also this year new upcoming dj and producer talent from abroad will be their guest once in every three months. Most of the time these artists are not to common with the majority of the crowd yet, this gives the WE LOVE… night an exclusive feeling with one security, the invited artists are always asked and scouted by The Walk and Rogerseventytwo themselves. And believe it or not, they know exactly what they're doing!\r\n\r\nNext to a being a DJ, Rogerseventytwo is also a producer. When he first started, his first inspiration came from music produced in the seventy’s. This period in time became a fascination while he was working on tracks that grasp the new French sound in a creative and innovative way. Curious? Here you find a list of tracks produced by Roger. And promise yourself one thing, make sure you’ll check these youngsters out; we’ll see you on the dance floor!",

  "artist_bio": "In a society where a career in music can be downloaded off the Internet, a person who knows where to buy a microphone is considered an artist and where someone who’s able to press play on tape claims to be a dj. In this world only a few stand out, amongst those chosen few is a young man from Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This is The Flexican’s society, welcome.In a society where a career in music can be downloaded off the Internet, a person who knows where to buy a microphone is considered an artist and where someone who’s able to press play on tape claims to be a dj. In this world only a few stand out, amongst those chosen few is a young man from Amsterdam, The Netherlands. This is The Flexican’s society, welcome.\r\n\r\nGrowing up in Mexico City, Mexico, surrounded by all sorts of latin- and rock music, with an uncle who worked as an audio technician for various shows and concerts. Often enough the young Thomás could go with him to watch his uncle prepare that night’s rock gig. His uncle, aware of his nephew’s fascination with music, hooked him up with a drum kit and at the age of six and when most kids were into football or karate his uncle took him to see one of the best musical teachers in Mexico. This was where Thomás took his first lesson in drumming. Being influenced by the bands at his uncle’s work Thomás developed an undying love for bands like Pink Floyd, Guns ‘N Roses and U2.\r\n\r\nIt’s around 1992 when Thomás, alongside his mother and younger brother, moved from Mexico to The Netherlands. Settled in Amsterdam one of the first things Thomás noticed was the MTV-culture that had sprung off in the early 80’s and went on to flourish in the 90’s. Thomás was hooked instantly. Not being able to turn his favorite TV channel off. Through MTV Thomás was introduced to various waves of music that were popular in the urban environment of America and Europe. Among these different styles of music was hiphop. Being so different to what he was used to hearing and seeing in Mexico, hiphop stood out. Supported by his mother and uncle they gave him a compilation with acts like C&C Music Factory on it and Ice-T’s 5th album Home Invasion.\r\n\r\nA few years later, entering high school, Thomás found new ways of answering the demand he had for hearing as much music as possible. As his record collection expanded his mother made him choose between his drum kit and the turntables with the mixer he desired. It didn’t take Thomás long to get rid of this dilemma which led to the makings of the perfect dj. As his old drum kit was no longer there to take up valuable space there all of a sudden was room for more & more records. Listening to acts like A Tribe Called Quest, Blackmoon, various Rawkus artists and more it’s safe to say that the mid 90’s was a good time to master your dj skills. It definitely was for Thomás, who learned the basics from a friend but later mastered his own style and soon took on the name The Flexican. Confident enough that he could rock a crowd he convinced the people of various party committees on local high schools that he was the one who they should hire as their dj. This way The Flexican made a name for himself among his friends and extended friends.\r\nTogether with his friends Andras Caron and Yousef Gnaoui they started the DasDatDing parties. A series of parties that started in Club More in Amsterdam. Although DasDatDing only lasted for three months on a weekly basis, it opened the door to the dj scene in Amsterdam for The Flexican. Around this time he worked for a restaurant where people asked him to spin at weddings and business parties alike. This is where he learned to experiment with different styles of music during his dj sets, as a dj with a hiphop state of mind he brought a special kind of flavor to these parties where the people weren’t necessarily familiar with hiphop or its way of mixing a track with the next track. After working a year for different restaurants he attended The School for Audio Engineering, which he graduated from two years later and where he mastered the style of music production and mixing.\r\n\r\nAround that time he started making mixtapes. Looking back, one of his first mixtapes Summer Madness is considered a classic. Another one of his early mixtapes was Numero Uno, a hiphop mixtape whereas Summer Madness was more funk and house orientated. He handed these tapes out to various people. One of who was Real El Canario, an established dj in the eclectic music scene. Inquiring to what the mixtapes were about Real only wanted Summer Madness and disregarded the hiphop tape. Because of their Latin roots they connected on a social level but more importantly Real was more than impressed by what he heard on Summer Madness. Real pointed the tape out to different agents. His hard work finally paid off and led to getting signed to his first agency. Having a gig here and there his record collection continued to grow and meant he still spent a lot of time at different record stores in the city. Where he later was invited to join the crew of Dance Tracks and later Rhythm Import.\r\n\r\nThe amount of parties he was asked for started to grow and his name began to ring out. The Flexican couldn’t combine his work for a record store any longer with his work as a dj and gave his regular job up to completely focus on his dj career. Because of his talent and S.A.E. background The Flexican was one of the first who saw the endless opportunities of dj’ing with CD’s opposed to using vinyl records. Making his own edits and testing each song on quality and possibilities before he burned them to CD he found ways to authenticate his dj sets and stand out from other dj’s.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment The Flexican moved from a barrio in Mexico City to ‘De Pijp’ in Amsterdam his best friend Yousef Gnaoui was a witness to The Flexican’s life story for the most part. Sharing a similar love for music they started experimenting with hiphop. When The Flexican was working at a restaurant or playing tunes at a wedding party Yousef was working on his acting skills at Likeminds, a local theatre collective where he met Glen Faria today better known as MC Fit. Yousef dubbed himself Sef Nice and with The Flexican as their dj and producer the hiphop group Flinke Namen was naturally formed. With Sef & The Flexican being almost the same age and MC Fit a few years older the latter closed the gap as far as age goes between Dutch oldschool hiphoplegend, host and comedian Murth The Man-O-Script who later joined Flinke Namen.\r\n\r\nFlinke Namen was introduced to the world with the track ‘Pelikanen’ through the soundtrack of ‘Scarfaced’, a Made In Da Shade (MC) theatre production. Thereafter Made In Da Shade embraced The Flexican into its family of creatives. Being a collective that combines hiphop, urban culture and theatre into a stageplay Made In Da Shade asked The Flexican to entirely produce their 2005 project ‘Kings’. A soundtrack that coined The Flexican’s musical style and launched the second Flinke Namen single ‘Niet Om Arrogant Te Doen’, this time with Murth on the track they set the tone for what people could expect from this up & coming hiphop group. During this time they were competing other up & coming hiphop acts in de Grote Prijs van Nederland. A much acclaimed national talent show where they made the finals and won the Musicians award.\r\nKings featured Dutch talents such as Pete Philly, Big Boy Caprice & Sticks. However, one track in particular stood out which was Bumayé with rapper Typhoon delivering the vocals. Referring to Muhammed Ali’s Rumble In The Jungle Bumayé had a couple of unique verses, a catchy hook. Together with the victorious sounding drums and Latin horns, cleverly put together by The Flexican, this is still a much-requested track. It’s often used as encore or climax to either a Flexican or a Typhoon show. Without ever being released as a single or having a video to it, Bumayé remains a diamond in the rough in the world of Dutch hiphop.\r\n\r\nCelebrated with various awards The Flexican became a force to be reckoned with, both as a producer and dj. Having dj gigs all over the country his work ethic and talent led to being asked to dj for popular radiostations Juize.FM, 3voor12XL on 3FM and deliver a monthly mix for Lijn5.com. Never scared to mix one style with another The Flexican saw the opportunity to bring his personal taste and vision for demand to a monthly party when his friends Yousef Gnaoui and Lee Stuart shared the idea to set a similar flavored party up called TheDirtyDirtyDirty. Successful as the concept was The Flexican’s continued to rise and became thé dj in the eclectic music scene with residencies in clubs like Jimmy Woo, Paradiso, Monza and on various parties and events. Among those are the GirlsLoveDJ’s parties, a successful party organization set up by long time friend Andras Caron. Together with Andras and Sef, The Flexican is working on The Century; an electro-based music project that you can expect in the not so far future.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the buzz that Flinke Namen generated was zooming through all the projects The Flexican took on. Everywhere he went people asked as to when their debut would drop. With his creativity on display on the track ‘Lichaamstaal’ with which they contributed to the soundtrack of yet another Made In Da Shade production; HRMNNH Kung-Fu Hossel. And the news that the group was signed to TopNotch, the biggest hiphop label in the country, while touring with Dio and The Opposites as Flinke Namen during the Op Volle Toeren tour kept the buzz alive and allowed them to postpone their debut while striving for perfection and the right time and place to release Superstuntwerk, their long awaited debut. With the success Flinke Namen had individually 2009 became the year to finally announce the release date of the album which the light of day on june 19th. Prior to this solely by The Flexican produced album sans guest appearances they released Kunst & Vliegwerk, containing collaborations with legend Extince amongst other talents this mixtape. In combination with SuperStuntWerk that featured the megahit ‘Als Ze Langs Loopt’, showed the musical diversity of The Flexican as a producer.\r\n\r\nThrough the various paths The Flexican walked to become the dj he is today he receives a unique amount of respect and credibility in the Dutch music scene as a whole. Bridging gaps between styles and time and again able to redefine the often-misplaced term ‘eclectic’ he became an entity in different worlds ranging from the gritty world of hiphop to the ever-evolving world of dance and everything that lies in between. From society’s underground to society’s mainstream; it’s all part of The Flexican Society.\r\n\r\nFor booking The Flexican, please contact: \r\n\r\nPOW!

It’s like my body needs it as much as it needs food, water or sunshine.”\r\nRight now, Trago’s immersion in music is almost total. An internationally renowned\r\nDJ, producer, live performer and label owner with three critically acclaimed albums to his name, the Dutchman divides his time between all-day studio sessions, DJ gigs\r\nand live shows all over the world, and a steady stream of musical collaborations.\r\nYou sometimes wonder how he finds time to sleep.\r\n\r\nHis dedication to the cause has been unflinching since his earliest years. He grew up in a free-spirited, artistic household, surrounded by music and encouraged to make his own. He entertained himself by recording his own home-made radio shows using the weird and wonderful albums he found in his parents’ record collection.\r\nAt the age of 15, he decided that he would devote his life to music. “I just had this\r\nrealization that life is so short, you have to pursue your dreams,” he says. “My dream was music. That’s all I ever wanted to do – to listen to it, discover it, make it, play it and share it.”\r\n\r\nEver since, he’s been living that dream. Success wasn’t instant, and in his early\r\nyears in Amsterdam he barely eked a living DJing in coffee shops, earning just\r\nenough to afford to feed his vinyl addiction. “As long as I had enough to live and buy\r\nrecords, I was happy,” he recalls. “It also gave me more time to make music.”\r\nHe was offered encouragement in these difficult early days by a number of figures on the Dutch scene, with the likes of Mike Kivits (AKA Aardvarck) and Steven De Peven (Awanto3) happy to act as unofficial mentors. As he still does now, Tom poured his heart and soul into making music. Early experiments with blends of experimental hiphop, jazz, Latin influences, Afrobeat sounds and soul-flecked broken beat caught the ear of local labels and producers, before he began to apply his composition and production skills to house music. By the time local label Rush Hour snapped up his debut single, “Live With The BBQ”, in 2006, he’d already developed a trademark style that blended the best of three decades of dance music – disco, boogie, synth funk, Detroit techno and more – with insatiable house rhythms and an intrinsic grasp of what makes dancefloors tick.\r\n\r\nIt’s this blend, not to mention his love of collaborating with musicians, vocalists and\r\nproducers from Amsterdam and beyond (think Romanthony, San Proper, Awanto 3,\r\nCinnaman, Tyree Cooper and Bok Bok), which makes his music so irresistible. Given his impressive track record, it’s perhaps unsurprising that several of his tracks – not least the rush-inducing “Use Me Again” and 2015’s equally delicious “Hidden Heart Of Gold” and “Brutal Romance” – sound like future classics.\r\n\r\nIt’s not surprising that Tom is a man in demand. Aside from travelling the glove, he\r\ncontinues to develop the Voyage Direct label he founded in 2010, an outlet for Dutch\r\nelectronic music that’s more like an extended family of like-minded musicians than a\r\nregular imprint. It celebrated its’ fifth birthday in Spring 2015 with a label compilation,\r\nahead of an expansive tour featuring appearances from various “VD” family\r\nmembers. As time moves on, Tom continues to pour his heart and soul into music, whether DJing, performing live or making new tracks. If you bump into him in the corner of some dark, sweaty club, you’re likely to find him excitedly talking about ideas for new projects – from film soundtracks to audiovisual performances and straight-up club tracks – or waxing lyrical about hitherto unknown producers he’s discovered in Amsterdam or Rotterdam.\r\n\r\nHis immersion in music may be total, but Tom Trago’s musical journey is far from\r\ncomplete. In fact, it’s only just begun…",

When he’s playing records he moves from sweet disco to dark melodic techno, and tips it off with some soulful house. His philosophy as a DJ is that a party should be a party without boundaries and taboo’s . So no matter the style or genre, he’ll play anything he likes to make the party everlasting. He is a well known guest at the Familiar Forest Festival  and is part of the organization behind Geroezemoes and Mad Mondays, at which he is also one of the resident DJs.\r\n\r\nIn his productions he samples a lot from records and uses all kinds of freaky day-to-day sounds. Combined with a variety of acoustic instruments and synthesizers, most of the time even he will not know where it’ll lead to, resulting in the creation of not-yet classified genres. His creations led to a contract with the Australian netlabel Mojodojo Media in 2010, and two released EP’s: Close To The and Acid Motherfucker.\r\nBesides his songs, he uses his creative force also to make soundscapes and to create sounddesigns for short films and animations.",

Active as a deejay in the dance scene around his home base Leiden (20 min outside Amsterdam) the name Tomaschek soon became well known, gathering his own fan-base.\r\nAfter founding the Lovin L’ectro concept in 2005 things were taken to the next level.\r\n\r\nWhat began as an intimate monthly residency to promote the “electro minded German sound”, grew rapidly to the most successful club night ever around the city of Leiden.\r\nEvery 1st Friday of the month the Lovin L’ectro Club Night with Tomaschek behind the decks is sold out non-stop since January 2007. Tons of guest deejays and live-acts were invited to perform along with Tomaschek at Lovin L’ectro and got a treat of one of the best club nights in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nDue to his hospitality, Tomaschek is frequently welcomed as a guest deejay at all kinds of organizations in and outside the Netherlands.\r\nFor example VOLTT, Electronation, Dance Valley, Mysteryland, Gasten zonder Grenzen, Body Condition, Eye on the Future and his German friends from Aspekt-records in Berlin, 7th Sunday, Outdoor Stereo and Fullhouse festival.\r\n (to name a few).\r\n\r\nClearly Tomaschek is a people and party minded deejay. Because of his 15+ years of experience he knows what to do at the right time, at the right place place and always keeps in mind what’s best for the night. Depending on the event, time and line up his goal is to either warm up and getting things started or just make the crowd go wild.\r\nThe perfect track at the right moment instead of playing that one difficult track which is just released and nobody ever heard. \r\n“Up! Up! Up! Hands in the air with a big smile and a wink! That’s what we all want”. \r\n\r\nAfter years of hard work, lots of gigs and his residency at Lovin L’ectro, Tomaschek is earning more and more fame in the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nBesides his monthly residency and all Lovin L’ectro events planned for the summer of 2010, Tomaschek’s festival season is looking very sunny...\r\n\r\nMusic style depending on time and place is a mixture of techhouse, minimal- techno and “electro”.\r\n",

He played amongst Hardwell, Nicky Romero & Tiësto and Tommy had the honor to close Tiësto’s concert in the Mezz, Breda!\r\n\r\nTommy has been showing interest in music since he was a kid. This interest which he inherited from home, inspired him to experiment a lot with all sorts of music. The experimenting led to the creation of his unique and outstanding style: a combination raw electro-house and electro.\r\nThis unique style was noticed by Hardwell and so Tommy’s ‘How We Roll’ became Demo of the Week in ‘Hardwell on Air’. ‘How We Roll’ also got noticed by Black Hole Recordings, former label of Tiësto, on which Tommy’s got several releases.\r\n\r\nTommy already received supported from big names like: Tiësto, Hardwell, Axwell, Steve Aoki, Markus Schulz, George Acosta, Miss Nine, Robbie Rivera, Quintino, R3hab, Jacob van Hage, René Amesz, Dannic, Firebeatz, and Ziggy amongst others.\r\n\r\nAs hard work pays off we can proudly announce that Tommy has played at Ultra Miami Festival 2014! This man is coming in like a bazooka!",

However, he was also heavily exposed to the techno scene in Amsterdam and Brighton. Today, he is mostly spotted in Berlin, as the darkness, but still openness, of this city inspires him a lot. \r\n\r\nHe is the founder of RMW020 (Raar Maar Waar), an experimental club night in Amsterdam that will be launched autumn 2011.

Op dit feest, waar onder andere Polder, Rauwkost, Bart Skils en Kabale Und Liebe te gast zijn geweest, werd een groot succes en is tot op de dag van vandaag één van de grootste feesten in Leiden. Sinds september 2005 is Tom resident op de bekende ASS-feesten in Zoetermeer waar hij onder andere met Billy Nasty, Marco Bailey, Heiko Laux, Bart Skils en Secret Cinema het podium heeft mogen delen. \r\n\r\nPrecies een jaar later leert hij Sander May kennen. Het wordt al snel duidelijk dat de verschillende stijlen muziek die beide dj’s ten gehore brengen goed bij elkaar passen. Het tweetal besluit vaker samen het podium te betreden en vergaart daardoor onder andere optredens op Rekorder, Free Your Mind Festival en Planet Rose. Tom en Sander hebben inmiddels in clubs als studio 80, Doornroosje, Tivoli en de Off Corso gestaan. \r\n\r\nIn 2006 start Tom een nieuw concept genaamd KLIKK, waar hij als resident inmiddels namen als Joris Voorn, Michel de Hey en Remy heeft mogen verwelkomen. Daarnaast ontstaat er ook een samenwerking tussen This is Sick en Complexed, genaamd This is Complexed in het LVC te Leiden. Als organisator en dj van Complexed, KLIKK en This is Complexed is hij inmiddels een bekende figuur in de Leidse scene. Tom is op het moment bezig met zijn eigen producties en hoopt in de toekomst zeker wat van zich te laten horen. \r\n",

His influences come from his own early explorations in nightlife and artists like Steve Bug, Laurent Garnier, Carl Cox, Miss Kittin, Alter Ego and Tiefschwarz. He also shows great admiration for his Dutch DJ heroes, Benny Rodrigues, Leroy Styles and Cleon Macnack, who have always managed to retain original techno, tech-house and house elements in their sets, despite the rapid growth of the Dutch electro/house scene.\r\n\r\nTimo’s success with Groovenatics since 2007 has given him the opportunity to work with many accomplished producers which has helped him develop his own production style even more. Consequently now is the perfect time for Timo Romme to return to playing and producing the music that first ignited his interest in dance. He aims to achieve the ultimate: the atmosphere that’s created with a perfectly built-up set, one that sets the dance-floor on fire and leaves you dancing all night until your feet seriously ache!",

His father being frontman of a band and his mother being frontwoman of a choir, it didn't take long for him to develop his own style of music. Tim has always been attracted to electronic music and was inspired by groups like The Prodigy.\r\n\r\nIn 1999 he went to his first techno party and was captivated by the feeling, ambiance ...and especially the sound. At that moment he decided to buy his own records and to produce the music he had come to love. He eventually built his own studio on the farm to make a perfect room for his analog gear.\r\n\r\nDiscography:\r\n2007 - Quagmire - Artist ensemble - B1 Tim Woestenenk - Sunset love\r\n2008 - 11AM - Tim Woestenenk - Structure of worlds\r\n2012 - Studio Soulrock - Tim Woestenenk - From Juno with love\r\n2012 - Aurora Records - Tim Woestenenk - The long kiss goodnight (Tba)\r\n\r\nIn 2012 he started his own record label, Aurora Records, with his friend Ferdi Blankena. It was a step to get more grip on the music they feel should be released and feels good to them.\r\n\r\nPlaying DJ sets with a very deep love for the black gold, he has developed a strong musical background. This experience rocks crowds and brings the audience in another state of mind.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by:\r\n\r\nThe Prodigy\r\nLarry Heard\r\nKerri Chandler\r\nRicardo Villalobos\r\nLuciano\r\nRichie Hawtin\r\nMarco Carola\r\nAnd offcourse all his friends around him!\r\n\r\nFrom techno to house music in it's purest form, Tim has been bitten by the music bug.",

  "artist_bio": "Tom Smeyers is a Belgian house DJ and producer based in Amsterdam The Netherlands.It all began in 1998 when Tom started playing his first gigs at local house events. During the first years of his early DJ career Tom played a mixture of styles, nowadays known as the Sound of Belgium.\r\n\r\nTom founded Moonraker in 2000, a techno concept that was held in Belgium and France. A final edition took place in 2005 inviting techno legend Scan X from Laurent Garnier's F Communications label.\r\n\r\nWhen Moonraker was founded Tom started playing gigs under two monickers, Tom Moonraker and Anti-Statik. Tom Moonraker represented tech house and melodic Detroit techno while Anti-Statik covered the darker styles of techno and electronic body music.\r\n\r\nOne of the highlights of Tom's techno era was playing for Kozzmozz at Vooruit Ghent, a sold out edition with performances by Tony Rohr (US) and Shinedoe (NL).\r\n\r\nAfter Moonraker it was time for a new musical chapter. Already playing house music next to melodic Detroit techno made it easy for Tom to make the switch to playing house music only sets. The absence of Moonraker was made up for in 2007 with the introduction of SneakerFreaks, a new house music concept by Tom Smeyers.\r\n\r\nSneakerFreaks was already held more than 16 times inviting local and known Belgian house DJ's such as Raoul Belmans, Red D, Massimo Dacosta, Soul Migrantz, Koenie, D'Stephanie, Diepvries, Flapjackers, Jenssen and many more.\r\n\r\nTom's first EP was a fact in 2011 when he got the opportunity to release on Guesthouse Music (US), one of the leading labels in (jacking) house music.

His influences come from his own early explorations in nightlife and artists like Steve Bug, Laurent Garnier, Carl Cox, Miss Kittin, Alter Ego and Tiefschwarz. He also shows great admiration for his Dutch DJ heroes, Benny Rodrigues, Leroy Styles and Cleon Macnack, who have always managed to retain original techno, tech-house and house elements in their sets, despite the rapid growth of the Dutch electro/house scene.\r\n\r\nTimo’s success with Groovenatics since 2007 has given him the opportunity to work with many accomplished producers which has helped him develop his own production style even more. Consequently now is the perfect time for Timo Romme to return to playing and producing the music that first ignited his interest in dance. He aims to achieve the ultimate: the atmosphere that’s created with a perfectly built-up set, one that sets the dance-floor on fire and leaves you dancing all night until your feet seriously ache!",

  "artist_bio": "Erwin van Moll has been taking piano lessons now for almost two years. \"It was about time\" he says. \"Standing still means the same as going backwards\". And he is someone who's always looking ahead. He was one of the first Dutch techno musicians during the early nineties and one of the main producers to give birth to the ‘Eindhoven techno sound’.Erwin van Moll has been taking piano lessons now for almost two years. \"It was about time\" he says. \"Standing still means the same as going backwards\". And he is someone who's always looking ahead. He was one of the first Dutch techno musicians during the early nineties and one of the main producers to give birth to the ‘Eindhoven techno sound’.\r\n\r\nSince then van Moll has built an extensive discography containing a wide variety of styles such as deep house & disco, break beats, ambient music and down tempo. When asked what all his music has in common there's a long pause. \"It all has a warmth and a strong atmosphere I hope\" he replies. \"Oh, and the bass line. I find the bass line very important in dance music\". You know exactly what he is talking about when you hear ‘Merging’, the killer single he made together with dj Nuno Dos Santos from Utrecht and which features vocals by house legend Robert Owens. The smooth, powerful bass line in that song draws one irresistibly to the dance floor.\r\n\r\nIt's not van Moll's only successful collaboration. After having worked mostly solo during the 90's as max 404 together with musician Jan Vanderlest and former Darryll-Ann singer Jelle Paulusma he started Clashing Egos in 2003. \"I did a week-long session in 2001 making music with befriended musicians and singer Kirsty Hawkshaw which was so inspiring it really made me want to do more pop oriented music together with others\" he motivates. \"I must admit that I was also a bit fed up with dance music at that time, which had become quite formulaic and uninteresting.\" The first Clashing Egos album 'rubicon' came out in 2004. The second one is scheduled for the end of 2008.\r\n\r\nSince then Erwin has also re-found his love for dance music. He said goodbye to his alter ego max 404 and was reborn as TJ Kong (TJ Kong is the rocket-riding cowboy in Stanley Kubrick's 'dr Strangelove' ). \"I noticed that I had started a new musical period so I wanted to make a fresh start\". This doesn’t mean that van Moll is ashamed of his previous work. He has released records on labels such as Mo’ Wax, Djax, Evolution/Universal Language and Eskimo Recordings, did remixes for David Holmes, Kirk Degiorgio, Steve Poindexter and Gerd and his 1995 album 'Love & Mathematics' has earned him a place in the acclaimed Penguin book 'The Rough Guide To Techno'.\r\n\r\nAs a dj Erwin's well-liked for his fluent and open minded style. He played every Dutch club and has stood in the spotlights at The End (London), Café d’Anvers (Antwerp), 10 days off (Ghent), Nitsa (Barcelona), Harry Klein (Munich), The Arches (Glasgow), Beam Hall (Tokyo) to name just a few. \r\n\r\nMusical inspiration he gets from books & films or during a walk or cycling-tour. He's a Dutchman after all. In such cases his mobile phone functions as a sketchbook. \"I sing or hum melodies and rhythms using the memo function of the phone\" he enthuses. \"Later I work these out in my studio\". It is exactly this lo-fi approach that he liked about the first Detroit techno records. \"I was a huge fan of top producers like Trevor Horn, Yello and François Kevorkian. But it was only after the first house and techno records from Chicago and Detroit appeared that I realized it might be possible to make electronic music without having a studio costing a hundred thousand euros. Guess how I made my first record ('Recycler EP')? It was made with just a borrowed sampler standing on an ironing board during Dutch Carnival!\". \r\n\r\nA full TJ Kong & Nuno Dos Santos album (including more vocal contributions by some of their house heroes) is planned to be finished before the end of 2008.",

Trickkit is a Dutch techno/minimal producer, DJ. Trickkit is an upcoming minimal dj with lots of techno influences, He wants to break thru in the world of electronic music with his deep, groovy minimal sounds that tend to rest on impressive strings and melodies. \r\n\r\nTrickkits life story starts in Nijkerk a village near Amersfoort. At the age of 6, little Trickkit (what he still is) was already playing with his dads records. Records from the OJays, Howling Wolf and many more. He bought his first record to mix at the age of 11, at that time the music was Hardcore and the side paths of Hardcore. After a short time he stopped with buying records and mixing. His Dj career looks to be at an end.\r\n\r\nAfter 9 years not buying records or mixing, he buys his first Techno record at the age of Twenty. This was after he got in contact with a drive-in and music rent company (MJFF). Who saw in Swen a Dj who feels what the crowd wants, and therefore would be a good all-round dj to get the crowd dancing. Besides the music technique and all-round Dj job. The company owner saw that Swen had more in him than the skills he performed, en saw that Trickkits interest lays with electronic dance music. Things like Techno, Minimal, Progressive, Club and Groove. So the owner of MJFF  bought 2 technics a mixer and two table top players to give Swen the space to praktice his mixing skills and express his love for dance music.\r\n\r\nNow he's also exploring the wolrd of producing. With Ableton live & logic studio. And sticks all his time in new productions. Productions of a wide variety from Techhouse to minimal en from minimal to techno with hiphop influences. He's working with a hip-hop producer that call's himself Significant Dutch or Natural . Together they work with some big names in de Dutch hiphop scene but also from France and even America.\r\n\r\nTrickkits love lies in the row of minimal, techno, techhouse. In his record bag youll'd find techno, funky techno, minimal, electro, techhouse, groovy stuff, classics and lots more things you wouldn't expect. However, he built an oeuvre that is without a doubt of a high magnitude: both quality and quantity-wise. Unfortunately, his busy DJ schedule puts a limit on the time he would like to spend in the studio. Yet, he strives for the balance that would satisfy his enormous artistic appetite and potential. His devotion to his dreams and inspirations drives him hopefully safely into the succesfull future.",

His style is best described as rolling, deep and melodic house music with a big dose of funk and groove. It’s a guaranteed party in and outside the dj booth when Tim is spinning his tracks. Standing still, during his sets, is not an option. His splendid musical choice allows him to be the perfect DJ to warm things up with deep melodic sounds , or his unique pick of rolling funky techhouse with a bit of techno is suitable for any main room atmosphere. Not afraid to use some classic house tracks and vocal edits in his sets as well Tim finds interaction with his crowd very important. His sets these days are inspired by deep labels such as Life and Death, Innervisions, Kompakt, Noir Music and Ellum. And for more tech sounds, Hot Creations,Desolat, Crosstown Rebels and Cadenza. Also some indie dance & nu disco flavoured labels like PopArt. So anything with deep melodic influences and a big dose of funk/groove with a rolling drive.",

Laying down considered sets that entertain but also find him digging deep, he is a DJ that never fails to connect with a room whether warming up, closing down or playing the peak of the night.\r\n\r\nHis sets at that club lead to the man with the big afro winning fans further around Europe, and as such he now plays all over the place on a regular basis. In production terms, Tsepo rates quality over quantity. He has so far given us a glimpse of his emotive sound with a remix of Kompakt’s tasteful Icelandic pop pairing GusGus. That track was just the start of things to come.\r\n\r\nInspired by classy selectors including Move D and Gerd Janson and producers like Roman Flügel, rather than rushing out his first creations into the world, Tsepo has taken his time to really find his own sonic identity. Because of that they ooze real atmosphere and, alongside his DJ sets, are sure to keep on winning him fans.",

Samen met 'Mathew Koster' organiseerde hij twee edities van 'Sequence', met als gast dj's Rachid Prins (ROT), Audiowomb en Nonce (Give Soul). De feesten zijn uitgegroeid tot een muzikaal spektakel waarbij, ook de volgende editie, Timothy Luppez weer zal knallen.\r\n\r\nEind 2012 was hij de winnaar in de Perron DJ contest, opende voor Secret Cinema op de PERRON.FM livestream en maakte zijn debuut in Cultuurpodium Perron met een knaller van een techno set. Hierdoor zijn er nieuwe deuren geopend en is er in 2013 van alles te verwachte van dit dj talent. Met zijn rauwe, experimentele en opzwepende stijl levert hij één bonk energie waardoor je tot leven komt op de dansvloer.",

Raw primitive production and sound (the first 7 albums were recorded on a nearly-broken cassette recorder - it was all they had!), very diverse in style, but always with that typical twisted, paranoid and fucked-up drive, a bad sweaty groove that feels like a mindfuck.",

When I was 15 at the basketball court in Haarlem, I met Vincent Verburg. We showed each other some street dance moves. We hooked up and started to practice and to network. Before we knew it, we were performing in clubs and jazz festivals as street jazz dancers. Our style was a combination of hip hop, breakdance, tricks, fast jazz footwork, and acrobatics. \r\nA few years later, I met other jazz dancers like Gary and Seymore Nurse, Norville, Levi, John, Adolf, Jelly Germain (a French tap dancer), Johan, Jerry, and of course, my brother, DJ Carlito, all specialists in jazz dance.”   \r\nIn 1990, DJ Urvinson spent time at the Jazzbopparties in Paradiso in Amsterdam and at the Hardbopparties at Fellini’s, an underground club in Utrecht. “That time was very important in my life as a dancer,” says DJ Urvinson. “I spent Sunday nights club hopping from Havanna’s The Message to the Roxy and the Richter in Amsterdam, which were the hottest places to be for dancers from all over the world. At that time my brother Carlos was already DJing. My focus was strictly dance and dance performance.”\r\nAuditions:\r\nIn 1999, DJ Urvinson shifted his focus to drama, acting, theatre, and DJing. He auditioned and did theater projects for schools with the theater group, Stout. Meanwhile, he bought two turntables and started to collect hip hop, R&B, soul, rare grooves, funk, disco, jazz, and deep house. “I surprised my brother, DJ Carlito, when I wanted to DJ. In the beginning, it was hard to combine all music styles the way DJ Carlito does, but he inspired me and I learned.”\r\nWicked Jazz Sounds:\r\nIn 2002, DJ Urvinson joined forces with Phil Horneman and Manne van der Zee and started a weekly Sunday club evening called Wicked Jazz Sounds, which is now held regularly at Sugar Factory. “Phil and I were the only two resident DJs working with Live musicians like Jeff Hollie and Vibemaster R.Skills,” says DJ Urvinson. “Wicked Jazz Sounds became really Big and is still a very successful concept and club night in the Dutch jazz and dance scene. Now we have a big family with a lot of musicians and DJs. I am a resident DJ and I am very proud to see Wicked Jazz Sounds grow to what it has become today.”\r\nWicked Jazz Sounds has released a series of successful CDs. DJ Urvinson is featured on one of the last released within that serie: Wicked Jazz Sounds 6.\r\nMusicstyle he plays: Jazz from Acid-Jazz, Nu-Jazz, Punk Jazz, BeBop, Fusion, Latin, Contempio Boogaloo,  Drum & Bass SOUL,  FUNK, HIP HOP, LOUNGE, BREAKBEATS, R&B, HOUSE, FROM  DEEPHOUSE TO TECHHOUSE\r\nUrvinsons other activities: Brothers In Harmony, Producing with his brother DJ Carlito under their own Label Software For Soul Recordings with various artists.",

  "artist_bio": "Vitreous is the brainchild of Australian-born producer Chris Buckridge. Now based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, his work blends the best of the European minimal techno scene with the live, organic sounds and influences of his performing past.\r\n\r\nGEOSYNC EP OUT NOW THROUGH PLAN B RECORDINGS! \r\n\r\nWATCH THE VIDEO: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2drLCoY_aE\r\nVitreous is the brainchild of Australian-born producer Chris Buckridge. Now based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, his work is the sum of years of musical experience, whether on stage or in the studio.\r\n\r\nHaving studied music from his early school years and played bass in various Brisbane bands over the course of the 90s, Chris eventually found his most significant success to date in My Ninja Lover. A three-piece live act and production crew, MNL also featured Manta Ray and Porl Deville, already know for the work in breakbeat outfit Zephyr Timbre. MNL’s short lifespan (2004-2006) was a blur of tours, live shows and awards for their mix of breaks, electro and drum’n’bass.\r\n\r\nWhen the opportunity to relocate to Amsterdam presented itself at the end of 2006, however, the chance to see what evolution had in store was too great. Vitreous, originally envisaged as a label, became the vehicle for Chris’s solo production work, and the global shift unleashed a flood of inspiration.\r\n\r\nOver the last two years, Chris has refined an idiosyncratic style that blends the best of the European minimal techno scene with the live, organic sounds and influences of his performing past. Throughout the Vitreous repertoire is an appreciation for subtle, evolving, addictive rhythms. This is on display with tracks like 'Basmati’, a slap bass-driven electro concoction, ‘Pellets’, a twisted deep house epic, and 'Guise', a nu-disco groove that was released in 2009 with remixes from Segue, Fromage Disco, Kris-Ko and Alex Ward. It has also seen him tapped for various remixes: ‘Forward’, by Canadian producer Timothy Allen, garnered DJ praise and plays in 2008, with 2009-2010 bringing further remixes for Kris-Ko and Fromage Disco, as well as the release of the Noord and GeoSync EPs, through New York label Plan B Recordings, and a collaborative release through Smash Bang Records with Brisbane producer Dave Dri, aka Segue.\r\n\r\n2008 also saw Chris returning to performance, working with Ableton Live and mixing his own productions and remixes in sets up to 5 hours long around Amsterdam. 2009 should see opportunities to take the Vitreous sound to new audiences, in the Netherlands and beyond, and a slew of new tunes released on labels in Australia, the United States and Europe.",

The music that they are into are in very ways simular. Microove's (Michael Verhaaf) taste in music is very eclectic and he has played almost every style of music in the past. Now he playes a more mature deep sound of House that has influences of Groove, Disco, Soul, Jazz, Techno, Hip-Hop and all subcategories of House.\r\nMichiel Tettero playes a more uplifting TechHouse sound with influences of Fidget House, Electro, Jackin' House and other styles.\r\n\r\nTogether they bring a sound that you can describe as a old feeling of House. You can expect groovy bassline's, uplifting beats and offcourse, the by Versa Vica beloved Hi-Hats. \r\nNow they are also producing together, so soon you'll probably hear some of their material!\r\n\r\n'Vica Versa, or was it Versa Vica?

The name Umoja is a Swahili word meaning unity; the spirit of togetherness a philosophy shared by the two producers. Umoja has over a decade of experience dishing out warm dusty grooves. The duo is part of the Amsterdam based INI Movement, a collective of creative entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nThe conception of Umoja is not a fable involving neither an A&R exec nor does it involve been stranded in the Amazon rainforest with nothing but two synthesizers. It is rather an organic evolution between two humble groove aficionados whose path crossed over half a decade ago. Both Sjef and Job born and bred in the commuting town of Haarlem in the Netherlands. The duo came to know each other through their individual production and disc jockeying rendezvous. Their musical partnership would not take off until 8 months later when they collectively built a studio in a massive loft then occupied by Sjef Rolet. The studio became known as the Pigeon Hole, with a spin off late-night radio show. It was during this period that the two producers intimately got to know the each other’s work.  Sjef was at this period more aligned with hip-hop/beat oriented productions while Job was into trip hop/electronic  productions. They shared a similar trait: an intrinsic appreciation and a understanding of world rhythm, the mechanisms of groove and contemporary electronic beats. Regardless of their shared interests the two had yet to collaborate; this was soon to change.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 2011, Sjef and Job’s individual projects were in hibernation at that time. With time spare they both sought to expand their production skills. Unbeknownst the other, they were both experimenting with sounds from afro-beat and world music traditions. These experimentations later came to be known as the ‘after-pigeon late night sessions’. It was during this period that both producers immensely influenced and learned from each other; the birth of Umoja had arrived. Resulting from after-pigeon late night sessions was the Je–Ka–Lo! ep . The ep constituted 6 tracks pivoting around eccentric afro-beat tracks  inspired by west african funk from the ‘70s. Je-Ka-Lo! as a record was subconsciously crafted as a prologue to Umoja, and simultaneously as an epilogue to the pigeon studios era.   At the time of its release Umoja was merely a side project for the two hyperactive producers. Slowly, Je-Ka-Lo crept through the ears into the hearts of world music enthusiasts and afro sound connoisseurs. Umoja’s rave reception by the online community coupled with success within Amsterdam nightlife scene prompted the duo to reassess their commitment to Umoja. \r\n\r\nAn attempt to categorically pin down the sound of Umoja is only but a pipe dream. In the spirit of ‘Umoja’, Sjef and Job’s approach to music is to unify grooves across the seven oceans, one record at a time. With a well-received record under its belt Umoja went back into the studio to work on a new record. Eleven moths later Umoja presents ‘Vuelo Nocturno’, the duo’s sophomore record. Vuelo Nocturno is a beat oriented cumbia record oscillating between Columbian & Mexican sounds. Percussion driven and with the rich palletes, dubbed & well crafted effects. \r\n",

Within a year Wessel became one of the better DJ's of the underground scene in Rotterdam. \r\n\r\nAfter two years of frequently visiting house and techno party’s, he felt that it was time to expand his love for electronic music and he wanted to present his own interpretations to the underground scene. He gets his inspiration from an already fair share of life experience and translates this into his music, which give his sound a unique character.\r\n\r\nAfter starting at Bootleg DJ Café, he received and grabbed a lot of opportunities. For example he played at Triphouse Rotterdam for their Tripstream, played at various party’s in and nearby Rotterdam and has proven himself several times on the events of ‘Rotterdamsche Nieuwe’.\r\n\r\nBeing submerged in various musical creativity, it wasn’t long before he found himself interested in producing his own music. For the coming years it is his ambition to produce his own tracks and expand his typical tech and deep house music collection.\r\n\r\nNL:\r\n\r\nWessel begon in 2011 met draaien en heeft zich binnen een jaar opgewerkt tot een van de betere DJ’s in Rotterdam. Met een flinke dosis levenservaring waaruit hij inspiratie kan putten is deze DJ er een die je niet vaak tegenkomt. \r\n\r\nNa twee jaar house en techno feesten afgelopen te hebben wist hij dat het tijd was om zijn liefde voor elektronische muziek ten gehore te brengen aan het underground publiek.\r\n\r\nNa begonnen te zijn in Bootleg DJ Cafe kreeg en greep hij veel kansen. Zo draaide hij bijvoorbeeld bij Triphouse Rotterdam voor de Tripstream, op verschillende feesten in en rond Rotterdam en heeft hij zich meer dan bewezen op de evenementen van Rotterdamsche Nieuwe.\r\n\r\nIn de komende jaren zal hij zich verder verdiepen in het produceren van tracks en in het uitbreiden van zijn muziek collectie waaruit zijn typische tech en deephouse voortkomen.",

You will not be able to stay still and a full dance floor is guaranteed!Ronald Verdegaal, also known as Verdi, was inspired to techno at the age of 16. He was amazed by the performances of legends like Jeff Mills, Dave Clarke, Jay Denham and Chris Liebing at “Awakenings”, which is a houseparty in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.He knew straight away that this is what he wanted to do!\r\n?Soon after, he borrowed money from his parents to buy professional DJ equipment and started to buy his first pieces of techno released on 12” at Outland Records in Amsterdam, which he visited weekly to keep up to date with the latest records.\r\nHis 1st demo was straight away a big success and resulted in an invitation from a local radio station called “Next Groove”. They asked him immediately to come back and perform more.This resulted as well in his 1st official gig in “Club ‘t Zeepaardje”, in his old domicile Noordwijk, where he became one of the resident DJs. Then he switched to “Discotheek de Bob” where he had his own “Techno Eve”.\r\nIt was no surprise that Verdi’s career came in a rollercoaster; he received many bookings and has played all over the “Bollenstreek” and beyond. He was several times guest-DJ at “Q-Beach” and lots of other locations.\r\nAbout 2 years ago, he started to specialize in minimal techno and tech-house, which was a big success from the very beginning.The club night “Vaag” in Noordwijk was born and was a widespread success from scratch.He is also the main organizer of parties like  “Full Moon Party” and “Hole in One”, all big successes.\r\nThe club scene in Amsterdam is his next project, since he moved there back in 2010. He already has his own clubnight called \"ThemeHouse\"at ”Club 8”and \"ClubUp\", which was launched in 2011.\r\nDJ Verdi’s secret is his style, being “fat groovy party music”; it rocks the dance floor!

Both Harm and Merijn got their start in the film industry, which is where they met in 2010. When they found out they shared the same love for creating electronic music, they decided to team up.Merijn’s musical background is mainly trip-hop, while Harm is influenced by house and jazz music. The two combined their different backgrounds into a unique sound for their first EP, “Half Age” on Atomnation, released in March 2013. Shortly thereafter, they premiered their live show at Pitch Festival 2013, after which more shows followed.\r\n\r\n2014 started off with a bang for Weval. Their track “Detian” from the Half Age EP was featured in a Schweppes commercial starring Penelope Cruz. Detian ended up at #5 in the French iTunes Electronica top 100. Two month's later the remix they made of Gui Boratto's new single 'Take Control' charted #1 at Beatport's Electronica Top 100.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the duo is working hard on their new EP which will be released on the legendary Kompakt label.",

His style is described as being galvanizing, sucking you into his maelstrom of pure energy with his uplifting sets of house and deephouse. It’s this energy that’s not only transported by means of music, but by him as a person as well making him a true character and fun to watch.

After watching a horrific documentary about factory farming he became a vegetarian at the age of seventeen. While reading books, seeing videos and talking with a lot of people who are vegan and concerned about animal well fare he became a vegan himself. For him this is the best way to ban all animal abuse in his life. Eleven years have past and now he tries to motivate other people to be more aware of animal and human rights and the ecological problems in the world. He is always wearing t-shirts and buttons witch are about these issues or handing out leaflets to inform the crowd \r\n",

Widely recognized as the originator of the ‘Dirty House’ genre/movement in his home country and internationally renowned for his ‘Badman Riddim’ anthem, the 28-year-old music enthusiast has already won thousands of fans with his immensely energetic stage presence, rather rebellious attitude and by generally doing things his way. So who is this kid, who appears to be the poster boy for DIY artists, building his empire with his own two hands and a rather insane furry ear flap hat? What drives a lad to wake up, look at the music industry with disregard for the way things have been going for years, raise one eyebrow and say: “To hell with it!”\r\n \r\nBorn and raised in Spijkenisse, a small town generally hidden from sight by the thick smog of Rotterdam’s industrial zone, Vato Gonzalez spent most of his teenage days hanging around the block, messing up his eardrums by listening to UK garage, hip hop and dance hall. He used his college years to discover whether or not he wanted to be the next Mark Zuckerberg or become a world famous graphic designer like Paul Rand. In the end, he decided on ‘none of the above’, but not before he put his acquired knowledge to good use with slightly evil intentions. Tapping into the university’s student database, he started promoting his own party, which quickly turned into one of the most popular student nights out. These days, he is still a part-time software engineer and designs all the artwork for his own events, in between gigs and studio time.\r\n \r\nEarning his stripes in clubland by gigging relentlessly for almost a decade, Vato Gonzalez gets his big break in 2007, when he decides to unleash the first ‘Dirty House’ mixtape to the public. The fast-paced mixed first mixtape proves to be an instant hit with the crowd and spreads like wildfire all over the internet, resulting in more than 150.000 downloads. When asked what ‘Dirty House’ actually is, Vato Gonzalez states: ”Whether your kid brother or the biggest super producer in the World has produced the record, I could care less. Genres do not apply, whether it’s tech-house, progressive, Brasil Funk, Baltimore club or electro, as long as the tune has that essential energy to rock my socks! Goodbye to the boring overproduced and politically overhyped records of the past! Hello to the thumping, rocking, down low and dirty records of the future, which give punters their money’s worth when they go out clubbing.” Quickly after the launch of the first mixtape, he starts with ‘Dirty House’ events and as the brand/genre grows, he keeps selling out clubs with his ‘Dirty House’ concept, starts hosting ‘Dirty House’ areas at massive events and as a result, he becomes one of the main festival attractions in Holland himself. Around this time, he also hooks up with his sidekick & partner in crime, MC Tjen, with whom he soon becomes one of the most lethal DJ/MC combos in Holland, tearing the roof of many clubs with their unparalleled energy and nonstop hype during their performances. Fed up with the state of the industry at large, he also decides to set up his own booking agency, ‘010 Bookings’, ‘Dirty House’ record label and ‘Dirty House’ publishing arm, to become completely independent. As demand keeps growing for ‘Dirty House’, he rolls out four additional mixtapes within the next 3 years, amassing well over half a million downloads together. In retrospect, Vato Gonzalez comments: “There was no masterplan behind launching the ‘Dirty House’ brand. We just felt people were looking for something hot and exciting and were tired of hearing the same old, dull records in clubs. With the mixtapes & events we brought the hype back and gave the crowd a voice! We just ran with it and it took off in a big way, way beyond our expectations.” Currently averaging over 350 shows per year, his schedule takes him all over Europe (Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, UK, France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Greece, and Hungary) and he’s ready to add a few more continents in the near future. \r\n \r\nFast forward to 2010: ‘Badman Riddim’, a tune Vato Gonzalez produced three years earlier, starts buzzing in the UK. While gradually notching up over 2 million YouTube views, the song finds its way to some key UK tastemaker DJs through amazing DIY promotion vehicles like Yousendit, Mediafire & Zippyshare, which are hated by the anti-piracy lobby, yet loved by DIY artists such as ‘Dirty House’ bastard Vato Gonzalez. Soon after, ‘Badman Riddim’ pops up in specialist shows on BBC Radio 1 and gets snatched up by the mighty Levels Recordings/Ministry of Sound, who turn the Godzilla inspired tune into the actual monster that slowly, but surely creeps up to people. As a result, ‘Badman Riddim’ quickly becomes one of the biggest instrumental club tracks of 2010, winning over the likes of Annie Mac, Zane Lowe, Annie Nightingale, Pete Tong, MistaJam and Toddla T at BBC Radio 1, while also being championed in the clubs by a very wide selection of DJs, including the likes of Crookers, Chuckie, Skream, Tiësto, Grandmaster Flash, Congorock, Roger Sanchez, DJ Fresh, Erick Morillo, Benga, Avicii, Zinc, and Jaguar Skills, to name but a few. As the record keeps gaining momentum, UK urban heavyweights Foreign Beggars jump on board and add their trademark rhymes, which combined with Vato Gonzalez’ killer hook and phat bassline, quickly becomes one of the biggest summer anthems of 2011.\r\n \r\nWhat’s up next, you might wonder? Early 2011, Vato Gonzalez launches his brand new event concept and record label ‘Crowd Control’, which he also plans to tour the world with and use as an imprint to release some of his own releases and music by like-minded artists. ‘Crowd Control’ can be considered the big room and more tech-house, progressive brother of ‘Dirty House’, showcasing how Vato’s sound has matured the last few years. But, he is not about to leave his ‘Dirty House’ roots behind though; in true Vato fashion he states: “I don't do ‘and/or’, I do ‘and/and’. Just like one does not only favor one type of food, I don't favor just one kind of music.” Much like the past ten years, most would consider his philosophy quite impossible, if not sheer madness; but if he had listened to everyone saying he couldn’t, then you wouldn't be reading this biography at present.\r\n\r\nWith forthcoming releases and remixes on labels such as Southern Fried, Sony Music, Universal, Ministry of Sound and some heavy collaborations in the pipeline, 2011 is looking like a monster year for this ‘Dirty House’ bastard!\r\n",

Some soft, smooth and emotional. Sometime harschly digital and synthetic, not shy in organic and realism in sound design.\r\n\r\nAfter a history of Jazz and Death Metal, electronic music took over around 2007. Realizing a first release on Moon Koradji Records in 2008,\r\nWhrikk has been featured on several cd's by different labels and is now working on an album.",

  "artist_bio": "no weapon formed against me shall prosperFor Wendel Sield, it all began at a very young age, when he was trying to beatmatch two tapes with cassette players at home. His family was really into music and Wendel was surrounded by jazz, soul and funk, which explains his love for these genres. When he was 15, he started working on his own music mixes, gathering all the vinyl he could find.\r\nBeing influenced by jazz, soul and funk, his mixes stood out and some time later he started collaborating with his best childhood friend. Together, they built a small studio and did some small gigs. Later, they released several EP’s like “Groovebag EP” and “That Man”, which ended up hitting the charts on platforms like Traxsource and Stompy. After performing together for three years, playing all the clubs in Amsterdam and Utrecht and some of the bigger festivals in The Netherlands, the collaboration ended. Why? Well, long story short: they felt like they were forced to play music they didn’t enjoy anymore, so they decided to finish it and start all over again, doing the things they love most.\r\n“For me, being a good dj means taking the time to actually go to a record store, dig for records, create a good track selection and combine this with great mixing skills. There’s no skill in pressing sync, a lot of people only do it for the fame. If you find yourself in the position to entertain people with your music, make sure to be on top of your game.”\r\nAt the moment, Wendel Sield holds a residency at the “Our Society” and \"Spot On\" collective in Amsterdam and he is working on his next 12 inch EP’s, scheduled for later this year. So, keep an eye out for these and if you get the chance to see him as deejay, don’t miss out on his mixes of down-tempo funk, Chicago house, acid and even ghetto house!",

  "artist_bio": "030303 RECORDS / EVENTS / DJ's / LIVE ACT\r\nAdvanced electronic acid sound\r\nBased in Utrecht, 030303 Records is a wonderful platform for the advancement of acid sounds, adopting influences from diverse genres of underground electronic music such as electro, techno, electronica and neo-disco. \r\nUtrecht's dj-collective and recordlabel 030303.Travel just thirty kilometers south from Amsterdam and you'll find another world where jogging pants are the new cool and people actually feel free to smile when they go out. You have arrived in Utrecht. Call it Little Cornwall if you will, because it was in the South-West corner of England that lads like Aphex Twin, Luke Vibert and Mike Paradinas made their quirky yet emotional electronic music without acting cool as was common practice in the dancemusic scene at the time.\r\nIt's exactly this Cornish way of life that appealed to the boys of Utrecht's dj-collective and recordlabel 030303. Mind you, 030303 are not ashamed of their love for serious IDM and glitch flavoured tunes by contemporary hotshots such as Richard Devine and Nosaj Thing. But they also enjoy watching the unsure expressions on the faces of their fellow music lovers whilst playing eurotrashy tunes by the likes of Twenty 4 Seven and Quadrophonia in trashy taverns such as Tivoli, Ekko, Melkweg and Kikker.\r\n\r\nAs healthier ways of living came into fashion in the 1980s, acid became more than a mere chemical substance and started to come out of machines as well. Despite their very young age, the 030303 crew became a huge fan of a particular bassline machine made by the Roland corporation and so did other now big names such as Cylob, D'Arcangelo and Ceephax amongst others, all of which come and celebrate the acid bleep at 030303 events around Utrecht and the dandy town of Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nBeing right in the middle of the happening acid-scene, the 030303 crew could not help doing what any other freak would do: they had to start releasing acid-tunes by Braindance veterans as well as by younger musicians. 030303's chart-toppers range from subtle to bombastic and highly psychedelic, the common denominator always being a very deep bleep.\r\n\r\nIt's just as fantastic as you've just read: 030303 brings a very complete picture that will never be equaled by any other crew. Feel free to rock up at any 030303 event near you but don't forget to dress up as corny as possible! Aciiiiieeed!!! \r\n\r\nWe only book djs and artist we really like. When we buy music from them, and listen.

She performs as a DJ/LIVE act, bringing her beautiful sounds to all corners of the globe. \r\nHer original productions, collaborations and remixes have been released on iconic labels including; Plastic City, Suara, Kling Klong, Freude Am Tanzen,Tronic Soundz, Toolroom, Connaisseur, BassCulture, Pacha, 1:53.2 and Kosmo Records.\r\nZoë's track \"Cherish\" on Connaisseur Recordings' became house tune of the month in the November 2007 issue of Mix Mag and she also received great feedback on her 2 following EP's “Let The Music Play” and “Is It What” on French label BassCulture from artists like RadioSlave, Luciano, Laurent Garnier and Joris Voorn. The “You Got Me Started EP” on Spanish label Suara in 2011 reached the Deep House Charts on Beatport with her soulful track \"Right Here Feels So Good\".\r\nZoë Xenia releases her debut album in 2012 on German label Plastic City called “Heartbeat”, a true gem, taking the listener on a journey through down-tempo electronic beats, soul infused love songs, deep/tech-house and techno. \r\nShe initiated a project with befriended Swedish DJ/producer Cari Lekebusch with whom she's creates a fine fusion between the dark sounds of Techno and the soulful sweetness of Deep-House. Their 'Good Love Sweet Love EP', on German label Kling Klong in 2013 got amazing feedback and reached the Deep-House, Tech-House as well as the Techno charts on Beatport. In 2014 they released dance floor bomb \"Crazy\" on Monique Musique and the majestic \"Fly\" on Tulipa Records, both played out on festivals by Richie Hawtin and Adam Beyer.\r\nAside from producing her own music, Zoë Xenia has lent her distinct vocals to various other productions. She just came out on the brand new album from Mathias Kaden with their track \"Soulmakers\", Pacha Recordings invited her to come to Ibiza and record vocals for global all star producer Richard Grey. She wrote and sang \"Matters of the Heart\" for Tigerskin on Dessous Recordings and was approached by Kosmo Records to write vocals for the new mixes of BBE's huge dance-hit \"7 days and one week\" making her appearance as well in the promotional video, which has over a million views on TV and internet channels.\r\nWith her powerful sets, soulful voice and her ability to produce sounds as if from another planet,  Zoë Xenia weaves together a hypnotic, ecstatic experience for the listener and an extremely funked up situation for the dancing crowd; an exchange of energy that dissolves boundaries, where music becomes a universal language.",

  "artist_bio": "International DJ, producer and six times Amsterdam label heavyweight \r\n\r\nVision and versatility - the DNA that defines 2000 and One (aka Dylan Hermelijn) as an artist.  His pioneering vision across more than two decades of music genres, now ranks him as one the most versatile, in-demand international artists, commanding weekly performances on the house, techno and techhouse global club and festival circuits.Vision and versatility - the DNA that defines 2000 and One as an artist. Whether he’s performing for 40,000 housecrowds, 2500 techno lovers or 400 party people at an intimate, underground tech-house club, he’ll always cook the dancefloor. \r\n \r\n2000 And One (aka Dylan Hermelijn) has been on the forefront of electronic dance music since the late eighties. His pioneering vision across more than two decades of music genres, now ranks him as one the most versatile, in-demand international artists, commanding weekly performances on the house, techno and techhouse global club and festival circuits. \r\n\r\nNot only recognised as a magnet for the clubbing crowds, 2000 and One is also credited for championing the sounds of Amsterdam’s new school DJ and Producer generation and propelling the scene’s visibility into the international club headlights. \r\n\r\nBased in Amsterdam, his involvement with six of the city’s finest techno, techhouse and house labels - 100% Pure, Remote Area, Area Remote, Intacto (with Shinedoe), Bitten and Bangbang! (with Sandy Hüner) has offered a framework for the new generation of producers to hit the world stage. Collectively these labels have offered a staggering amount of underground dance anthems and it’s therefore no surprise that he’s recently been hailed as the inspiration for Amsterdam’s new sound generation, as well as the glue that binds it. \r\n\r\nInfluenced by a hiphop background, it all began in the late eighties, when heavily infected by the acid house bug he produced his first record at 17 under his moniker 2000 And One. A passion for musical diversity saw him release across other genres such as ambient & drum n bass before he became one of the first successful Dutch technoproducers, as well as one of the first in this genre to perform live. \r\n\r\nIn 1993 he launched 100% Pure Records with schoolmate and music partner in crime Sandy Hüner.  Now heading up the label solo, it is internationally recognized as Amsterdam’s longest running techhouse imprint and its foundations have paved the way for the success of his other labels. \r\n\r\nIn 2005, his epic stomper Adonai Elohim (2005) caught the eye of technofreaks around the globe. Then Tropical Melons (2006) became a massive festival hit, as well as Microfunk’s contemporary techno classic Pecan (2006), then Rare Tap (2009) scorched the international club systems. 2009 also welcomed the release of his debut album Heritage, a powerful homage to the timelessness of house music and picked up by many as one of the best house / techno albums of that year. \r\n\r\nAlthough his past accomplishments have made international sound waves, the new decade has witnessed a sonic boom of recent achievements - and like every sonic boom, there's an enormous amount of sound energy that is unleashed. That's why in 2011 you'll find his point of view with numerous remixes including his Defected remix of the house classic 4 You by 4th Measure Man as well as a bestseller collaboration with Sandy Huner - Tap Deux on Remote Area, 2 classics covered on his vinyl only Kreamm release on BangBang! plus his first solo EP since his album, Analogue Dreams on 100% Pure.\r\n\r\nOutside of his own studio he's presented his Essential Mix on BBC Radio 1 and moved to the Defected House with a series of mixes, releasing a new sound energy that has propelled him to the global party hotspots across Europe and the Americas as well as debut in Russia and return to Japan.  The white island called again for an exclusive summer residency at Ibiza’s Amnesia with Eric Prydz (Tonight), furthermore the Sensation madness that began in 2010 has continued with his back-to-back sessions with Joris Voorn,  driving the 40.000 party people insane.  And to ensure that more clubbers experience the madness, he's strengthened his bookings crew by joining The Bullitt Agency for his America gigs, complementing his worldwide bookings with agency Kazz_ema and his Dutch bookings with new agent Fire in the Disco.\r\n\r\nClearly as the decade progresses there's no sign of the 2000 and One's sonic boom silencing as he propels himself forward to break new sound barriers in the world of electronic dance music. \r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Thou shalt dance.  For those who know and love Zix, it’s assured - thou shalt dance. With a style that never fails to get the dance floor pumping, Zix has firmly established himself as one of the most revered techno DJs of the Netherlands. People who know Zix come to parties knowing they will be taken on a journey. Those who don’t are hooked from the moment the first record hits the turntables.\"Thou shalt dance.\"\r\n\r\nFor some people, Techno is not just music.... it’s a religion. For even fewer, this religion is the driving force that guides them in everything they do. ZIX is the leader of these people. With a style that never fails to get the dance floor pumping, ZIX has firmly established himself as one of the most revered techno DJs in Europe. Getting his original start in the Netherlands, ZIX is never too far from home unless he is on the road touring as an international DJ. People who know ZIX come to see his performances knowing they will be taken on a journey. Those who aren't familiar with him are hooked from his relentless work on the turntables.\r\n\r\nZIX comes from the South of Holland and was given the name Ziggy. Named after David Bowie’s infamous alter ego Ziggy Stardust, ZIX was destined for a career in music. As a youth, he was exposed to an eclectic variety of music from all around him. From mainstream to underground, Roxy Music to the Doors, he showed early on his affinity for music. However, it was Steve Rachmad’s \"Emerging\" CD that first inspired him to play Techno. “It was a style and kind of set that I’d never heard before - very unique on its own. It totally blew me away with its depth and energy.” ZIX says. Inspiration had struck. Immediately he embarked on a quest to create a sound of his own. Personal, unique, and full of emotion. After years of hard work, ZIX has emerged himself as a Powerful and hypnotic performer. His sets have been described by journalists as a \"Steam train bearing down on you... yet danceable and uplifting.\" Later his popular radio show was to be named LocoMotive, truly reflecting the harnessed energy of his sets. His radio show dominated the airwaves in Holland from 2004 through 2009.\r\n\r\nIt is this sound combined with his trademark long mixes and intelligent stylings that give fantastic songs an extra level of depth. He has built his reputation – and sets – on the ability to weave the different sounds together, with rarely heard or soon to be classics, that leave other DJs clamouring to know what that last track was. ZIX is an award winning DJ that has a rare trait. Not only is he a very in demand DJ, but he is also a favorite performer of many of today's biggest DJs and producers.\r\n\r\nWith over a decade of experience touring and playing festivals, ZIX has established a reputation for igniting the dancefloor with his high energy sets. In April 2004, he joined the renowned Dommelvallei organization as the first resident DJ and firmly established his relevance in the underground dance culture of the Netherlands. DommelVallei started as an underground Techno organization, throwing parties in warehouses, under freeway passes, in the woods – wherever it could - to give real techno lovers an alternative to the commercial music that was dominating parties and the airwaves. The events have since then, taken on a life of their own, with classic parties such as the legendary AlleyGator-parties at the Effenaar. The queensday festival PACT, and the summer festival E-troit. ZIX is the First DommelVallei Resident and the success of their events and his career have risen together to legendary status in the Netherlands as well as worldwide.\r\n\r\nWhether producing or at work behind the decks, there are two things on which ZIX always focuses: emotion and energy. As a DJ, ZIX is known for taking the crowd on a healthy, emotional rollercoaster, bringing them to a sustained, energetic state of ecstasy. “I’m there for the crowd first. it’s my responsibility to deliver a good set so they can enjoy themselves, let go of their problems and the pressures of daily life, and just have a good time.”\r\n\r\nThe past few years have seen ZIX on the rise. His performances at the Awakenings Festivals as well as at the massive DommelVallei's events have seen ZIX all around Europe as well as across the pond to the United States. \"There is no need to learn other languages when I travel, I try to communicate with my crowd through my music. Having the crowd dancing during my sets tells me they understand what i'm trying to say\" What is ZIX trying to say?... \"Thou Shalt Dance.\"",

Production and DJ act Youri Donatz has forged an impressive reputation as a producer and performer since his dj-birth in 1998. Strikingly current yet hauntingly retrospective, “Rituals EP” on (Monique Musique 2011) represents Youri Donatz’s best work in recent memory and further cements his reputation as one of the greatest tech minded house producers around.\r\n\r\nWith a truckload of support coming from big boys like Nic Fanciulli, Steve Lawler and Karotte the Dunkin’ Donatz sound is getting out of control. In a time when many musical acts are sticking to what has been ‘safe and tested’ Youri Donatz is really pushing the envelope with new and creative music filled with groovin’ phat baselines and is influenced by the melodic sounds of (deep) house guru’s François K, Todd Terry, Darren Emerson, Danny Tanaglia, Sneak, Dave Seaman, Deep Dish, Layo and Bushwacka, Funk d’ Void and many more.\r\n\r\nYouri Donatz has played at all the big Dutch festivals; Dance Valley, Extrema Outdoor, FFWD and Mysteryland to name a few and has been touring the clubs extensively the last few years. He’s played close to home and on the other side of the world; this man has been everywhere and seen it all. His passport contains Europe, (South) America, Canada, (South) Africa – you get the idea. You could say he has built up a nice permanent tan!\r\n\r\nYouri Donatz is the first Dutchman to create an exclusive samplepack for ProDJloops.com. With subtle nods to the Chicago and Detroit innovators of yesteryear, Youri Donatz draws upon their rich experience to deliver timeless groove after timeless groove.\r\n\r\nA seamless fusion of Techhouse and Techno is the best way to describe this studio monster’s style. With release on labels like Monique Musique (CA), Natural Rhythm (DE), Punta Del Este (URU), Pura Music (ESP), Elegant Bit (IT) and a zillion more this guy is certainly someone to check out regularly on beatport.com",

  "artist_bio": "For bookings: nick@meanwhile.nl For other enquiries: martijn@spektre.nl\r\n\r\nWouter S powerhouse maverick, Dutch Garage and Basshouse DJ.House DJ Wouter S. has just recently entered the Dutch electronic music scene but already established quite a name for himself. Not only through the hosting of very successful monthly parties in Utrecht based techno club Poema throughout the years 2011-2012, but mainly by standing out from the unmeasured amount of competition that was going on between DJs in Utrecht last couple of years.\r\n\r\nFinding his relieve in techno music as an enthusiast back in 2007, Wouter S. quickly got hold of DJ gear that would eventually lead him getting small and large crowds going throughout the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nBack in his early days as an eager party goer, Wouter S. was influenced by the minimal-techno sound that ruled the Utrecht underground music scene for some time. It is through the influence of passionate DJs and organizers that Wouter S. has remained loyal to his personal musical path and has always remained explicit in delivering the sound that is appropriate to his trusty audience.\r\n\r\nIn the years 2010 – 2011 when Utrecht found itself in a massive rise of small organizations that sought to deliver true house music and the minimal-techno sound slowly became part of the past, Wouter S. managed to fit in the new trend by communicating his own vision on house music. Not only through his musical selection as a DJ, but also by inviting renowned artists to his parties such as Jason Hodges, Andre Crom, Rafael Kakudo, Boris Werner and Lauhaus who fitted perfectly in the locally rising trend.\r\n\r\nIt is through this process that Wouter S. established his own vision on house music, and by collaborating with the likes of garage freak DJ and producer 'De Sluwe Vos' and holders of the jacking house sound, Pete Bandit, Jason Shae and Alex Fields, that Wouter S. released his first EP in the fall of 2012. Aside from his producing skills and his cutting edge mixing skills he developed through hard practice, Wouter S. possesses an incredible drive that has led him to where he is today.\r\n\r\nThere are but few DJs in Utrecht who have successfully withstood the coming and going of party organizations and Wouter S. is one of them. Moreover, Wouter S. secured himself a favorable position within his operating market which can be noticed in his recent gig at Smeerboel NYE and a big festival booking which will be revealed in the following months.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore that the future of Wouter S. is one that keeps every bystander watching from the shadows in await of his next move. Without supporting evidence, however, it has become clear to many that Wouter S. is not some naive trend hopper who is loved one day and put aside the other. Through this notice it can be said without any doubt that Wouter S. is no longer a talent that has to assert his position in the ever ongoing petty fights, but has become a full grown artist who knows his strengths and weaknesses and has learned how to work with them, never failing to lose sight of his vision and his goals.",

That's not just a coincidence: 2Dirty is on fire!Ever since their first hit 5 years ago, the Dutch DJ duo 2Dirty worked their way into the dance scene, quickly gaining support and fans worldwide with their energetic, uplifting and sexy house sound. Tracks like 'Climax In My Head' (Dance Tunes #1 and Dutch Single top 50), Let's Get Dirty and Our House Music are received well and played by DJs such as Tiësto, Diplo, Chuckie and Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike. Their busy show schedule takes them from The States, to France, Turkey, Albany and Spain, establishing them as a popular DJ act in The Netherlands and Belgium.\r\n\r\nTheir 5th anniversary was celebrated with their first (and sold out!) 2Dirty event in Maastricht Music Hall, setting an example for what the future may bring for these two passionate friends: more gigs, more events, more followers and above all: more music!",

Their newest album, 'After the Carnaval', makes ears salivate and hearts jump.\r\nThe bond between Rio-born vocalist/lyricist Lilian Vieira, keyboard man/producer Stefan Schmid (Munich) and drummer/producer Stefan Kruger (Amsterdam) goes back to 1998.\r\n\r\nThey’ve been on a rollercoaster since. Ten years of Zuco 103. Seen it all: from North Sea Jazz, Bumbershoot Seatle to Rock Werchter, playing everywhere: from Moscow to Tokyo.

Three musicians on a quest for brilliance inspire and enrich each other; they clash, there’s firework. It’s happening!\r\n\r\n\r\nSo again – of course – Zuco 103’s magical music cocktail adopts a new flavour on 'After the Carnaval'. A remarkably peaceful album. How they manage? By not taking anything for granted.\r\n\r\n'After the Carnaval' is Zuco 103's sixth album, partially recorded in Rio de Janeiro. Zuco 103 has moved away from sample-based music, which gives this album a natural, acoustic sound. Peaceful. Produced almost with a tough kind of carelessness.\r\nIn March 2007 the band went to Brazil for an extensive project. In cooperation with charity organisation Ibiss they produced demos for several Favela based bands, mostly composed by unfavored streetkids. Additionally, Stefan, Stefan and Lilian did a tour for the Brazilian release of their previous albums, and started recording for 'After the Carnaval' in the beautiful Rio de Janeiro studio 'Toca do Bandido'.\r\nInspired by Brazil, this famous studio, and full of new ideas the band collaborated with multitalent Sergio Cavazzioli (Gilberto Gil) on guitar, banjo and cavaquino, and the brilliant Marcos Suzano on percussion.\r\nAll the musicians had a spontaneous 'click' together.\r\n\r\nMutual respect, joy, virtuosity and open-mindedness: components that resulted in an instant excitement from the moment they met.\r\nSpontaneously they invented a new combination of sounds. 'Country samba for instance. How much straight up fun was that!\r\nBack in Amsterdam they compressed the sounds into the sprezzatura essence of songs that go straight to the heart.\r\nAnd again: there's Lilian Vieira's touching voice, together with the noisy glitter synths of Stefan Schmid and the cleverly pounding beats of Stefan Kruger.",
