He is also a label dj for both imprints.\r\n\r\n    As Augen, he released  an ep on Mimi records, one track on the dutch Spiritech Records, one remix for S.Francisco based producer and dj DF Tram, a couple of remixes for Aqob on Question of Time Records and has some new material about to be released on Womblabel.\r\n\r\nGabi aims for musical inconformism and the search for mystery, surprise, and unusual sensations or emotions.",

He’s also fond of 808 drum samples and lush chords. This can get him into trouble when in the company of other house heads but shows his willingness to test the boundaries of his chosen genre with often great results. Accatones musical know how, gained through a life on full front musicianship and live acts, enables him to translate his soul world influences into contemporary House music.\r\nIt’s difficult to sum up his productions and his dj sets as in a way he thrives for the old school House and Techno and brings his own imprint, a highly organic dance floor experience that can change in a clap and still maintain a natural voyage like flow. With a vast music selection on his crate, Accatone is able to blend both the old and new without any trouble of a sort.\r\nAccatone has been an artist and co-promoter for the past 4 years of one of the most successful modern prints in Portugal, Piston Recordings. It’s a family run label that has provided Accatone with the ground to make his cuts by walking freely in many different musical quadrants. Running their own label nights, there’s room for everything, and everyone comes down for the music’s quality and variety.\r\nHaving several EP’s and remixes released since 2008 and a full album in 2012 on labels like Dabit, Apparel, Piston Recordings, Roots & Wings, One to One, to name some, and having his work remixed by legendary Matthew Herbert or Jay Tripwire (Poker Flat, Tonality), Piek, (Cadenza, Paulatine, diynamic), Accatone is becoming a full-grown producer by conquering the likes of Dj Sneak, Laurent Garnier, Stacey Pullen, Slam, Timo Maas, Danny Tennaglia, Olderic, David Labeij, Mirco Violi, Severino Panzeta (Horse Meat Disco), Paco Osuna and many others!\r\nYears to come will certainly take notice on this newcomer that has been conquering the after-hours underground scene in Lisbon and Bilbao’s wonder nights or the deep Stuttgart scene and getting the recognition of Berlin's Weekend Club and other European club scenes.",

He is one of the pioneer producers of the Portuguese electronic music scene.Alex Santos (born 26 April 1975 in Coimbra), also known as Alex S, is a Portuguese DJ, musician and record producer. He is one of the pioneer producers of the Portuguese electronic music scene.\r\n\r\nDJ\r\n\r\nBeing just 15 years of age, got his first job as a DJ in a bar at São Pedro de Moel in Leiria. He has never stopped since then and Leiria (the town where he lived) was the background of his residences as a DJ. As time passed, the success of his productions made Santos an international hit. He played in well-known clubs such as The End (London), Neighbourhood (London), Sobe Live (Miami Beach), Essential (Riga), S.Q. (Poznan), and Sage Club (Berlin). In Portugal, he has been playing everywhere and was one of the guest DJs of Rock In Rio Lisboa 2006.\r\nAt the present time, he is the resident DJ and artistic director of Clube Suite in Leiria, Portugal.\r\n\r\nProducer\r\n\r\nIn 1994, under the alias of Urban Dreams, Santos became, just like DJ Vibe, Rui da Silva and The Ozone, one of the pioneers of the electronic dance music in Portugal. After some releases in a more alternative circuit, Santos got into the universe of Pop music and produced the album Estou na Lua by Os Lunáticos, a band in which he played for from 1995 to 1997. In 1998, he released his first CD titled Urban Dreams Productions, thus becoming the first Portuguese DJ/producer to record an album of original material.\r\nSo far, Santos has been one of the most famous producers of Portuguese electronic dance music. He has collaborated with both national and international artists such as Tracey Thorn, Rui da Silva, Melanie C, Michael Gray, Dennis Ferrer, Funky Green Dogs, Silence 4, David Fonseca, Corvos and Paulo Gonzo, just to name a few. In 2007, Santos was invited by the English singer Tracey Thorn, from the band Everything But the Girl, to write and produce a song for her second solo album Out of the Woods. The track is called “Grand Canyon” and was the third single taken from the album.\r\n\r\nCollaborations and groups\r\n\r\nDarkmountaingroup and Delicado\r\n\r\nHis collaboration with DJ Luís Leite gave origin to two projects: “Delicado” and “Darkmountaingroup”. In Delicado, they produce one of the most played tracks in Portugal in 2002, “The Sound of Fashion”. In Darkmountaingroup, Santos and Leite produce \"Lose Control\", one of the most internationally played tracks of electronic dance music in 2006.\r\n\r\nRodamaal\r\n\r\nIn 2002, with the French DJs Rocco and Manoo, Santos created the project Rodamaal. After a first 12’ inch was released by the French label “Jazz Up Recordings”, Rodamaal signed for the English “Buzzin’ Fly Records”, of the well known DJ, producer and musician Ben Watt, from the band Everything But the Girl. Tracks like “Música Feliz” and “Insomnia” become very popular in the international dance music scene. In 2007, the Rodamaal remix “Church Lady” by the well known producer Dennis Ferrer was released with commercial success\r\n",

In his teenage years his perception of music changed and was shown to him in a whole new light. It was the moment that he walked into a nightclub the size of his living room that he discovered his true passion and calling and most importantly, he discovered that less is more. Since that night on the Marginal dancefloor the little kid from Brazil took over and from minimal stances and groovy techno patterns, shone through a new found clarity and way of thinking.

She dismisses the need for words, especially when choosing music during her energetic and seductive DJ sets. She instinctively knows what the audience is thinking, or what people’s next move will be. This “female intuition,” for many considered a true “Midas’ touch,” is contagious throughout her playlists. \r\n\r\nAnalodjica takes a more elaborated stance. In her perspective, “music isn’t always a physical phenomenon, it can also be a mental one with a mathematical structure behind it.”\r\n\r\nSo, how did it all start? It was already eleven years ago! For Analodjica it was love that led her to the decks. She fell for a DJ and committed her first act of rebellion by jumping out of her bedroom window, to join him at an after-hours club.\r\n\r\nIt often feels that what has happened since has been a dream: in Portugal she has deejayed in the biggest and most respected nightspots – Lux, OpArt, Europa, Indústria, Gare, Sudoeste Festival, Rock in Rio Lisboa and at last years’ Boom Festival. \r\n\r\nOn an international level, Paris came first. And what better place to mark what is sure to be the first of many forays into Europe and beyond than the beautiful “City of Lights?” After that she span at places like The End, AKA, The Egg in London, Salvador da Bahia and São Paulo in Brazil, Ilhéu das Rolas in São Tomé e Príncipe, and so long…\r\n\r\nThis girl shapes her influences to create her own unique form of techno, like a rollercoaster filled with twists and turns, highs and lows, the kind that moves muscles in your body that you didn’t even know reacted to music.",

On other hand there's also his DJ capabilities, which took him to perform on either national or international clubs around Europe, but has more recently focused his efforts on the soulful realms of house music under the new handle Audiopath. His debut release with that moniker, the Kings of Kings EP, arrived on past february via Portugal's Circus Maximus imprint and besides being all over the majority of electronic orientated radio shows and press on it's own country and even in international press, it's also supported by artists like Robert Owens, Mr. G, Slam, Behling & Simpson, Moodymanc and plenty others more. Following this debut EP other releases are already scheduled to the Berliner label, Suena Hermosa. Keep an eye on fresh news soon.\r\n\r\n(Text partially extracted from XLR8R magazine)",

From a music passionate mind, to a national celebrity, A.Paul is today one of the key players of the electronic music scene on a worldwide scale, both as a DJ and as a Producer. His taste, technique and originality made him earn the respect from his peers and most of all the love and devotion from his fans.\r\n\r\nAfter the first years of musical discovery, his talent start to blossom when he was 13, despite living in a country where only a small percentage of people would listen to dance music, he always knew that these infectious rhythms would be on his path. After buying his first decks and mixer, including a couple of years of bedroom practice, he organized a few parties himself and later acquired his first residencies in clubs, through the hand of J.Daniel, who was one of the most respected Portuguese DJs in the 90′s. He was the owner of Question of Time Records, a vanguard record shop and record label, where A.Paul would later release his first record “Juice” a remarkable masterpiece that was played by many top DJs worldwide and licensed to various labels and compilations. He was also invited to be part of the Climacz project, the first after-hours club in Portugal, which was one of the first milestones of his career. The amazing spirit this venue brought to the Portuguese scene is still remembered with great joy and nostalgia by A.Paul himself.\r\n\r\nAt some point he felt the need to move on and search for new challenges. In 1996, he became part of the Illegal Records project as a techno import manager, was invited to be resident of the best club at that time Kremlin, and later founded his first labels, Squeeze Records and Onh.Cet, which were two relevant projects that helped define and polish his sound. By then he was also already playing quite a lot as freelancer, in a growing market. Portugal was at its peak, in terms of electronic music popularity and A.Paul was playing at one point every weekend on different parts of the country. It was inevitable that he would decide to stick to this option for his career, as opposed to be resident in a club, where he would be more limited in terms of music taste.\r\n\r\nIn 1997 he joins the X-Club, the most important DJ Agency and party organizer in Portugal. All the top cats were signed to X-Club, and so was A.Paul, first as a supporting artist, and later part of the agency’s top artists too. This period was very important for A.Paul, and his growth was remarkable, because he had the chance to meet and play with all the major techno and house artists in the world. Other projects developed by A.Paul at that time include sound engineering, journalism and also graphic and web design, activities that would become also important on his next projects.\r\n\r\nA.Paul was voted best Portuguese techno DJ in 2000, 2001, and 2002 by the readers of Dance Club, the main electronic music media vehicle in Portugal. A.Paul has never stopped investing and supporting the electronic music community particularly in techno. This is when A.Paul decides to start exploring the international market, due to the changes in the Portuguese scene.1994 to 2000 was monumental time after suffering from the huge decline in quality and quantity of events and musical culture. From the “Paradise Called Portugal” coined years before by international media, Portugal was now a place with a stagnated scene, and techno was probably the first genre to suffer. It was time for change, this crisis lead him to invest his time in a music production career, that was quiet for a few years due to the higher demand for DJ previously. In 2001 he opened Genesis record shop. Later in 2007 A.Paul was co-owner of MPC Vinyl Distribution, with his long-time friends Cisco Ferreira (The Advent) and Michaelangelo, where he also released on his other sub -labels The Light, Parallel 125, Dirty Ego, LK and Xtractz.\r\n\r\nIn In 2012 A.Paul’s most renowned & most successful project to date is Naked Lunch Records which was created back in 2005 really began to really take mold into one of the driving forces in the techno scene. Naked Lunch Podcast, a weekly podcast, which is a careful balance of top quality underground DJs and the game changers in the techno scene.\r\n\r\nFast forward to 2013, this marked a new monumental moment in A.Paul’s career as a promoter, by the end of the year he had 5 success events under his belt! With the success of the highly acclaimed Naked Lunch Nights in Portugal, its natural step would be to take his events international for 2014, alongside the grand opening of the much anticipated Naked Lunch Agency, the missing puzzle piece to complete his techno vision & one day his legacy.\r\n\r\nA.Paul has released over 100 vinyl records, several mixed CD compilations released in amazing labels like; Kombination Research, Synewave, Planet Rhyhtm, Italo Business, Pure Sonik, Theory, Mastertraxx, Beat Disaster, Yin Yang, Impact Mechanics, and has remixed artists such as The Advent, Ben Sims, Eric Sneo, Angel Alanis, Damon Wild, DJ T-1000, Virgil Enzinger, Robert Armani, Dave The Drummer, Dj Preach, Mike Humphries, Spiros Kaloumenos, Torsten Kanzler, Bas Mooy, Housemaster Boyz and many more.\r\n\r\nBesides his sound of hard, funky, deep bass lines he is renowned for, he has also been known productions in tech- house, minimal and experimental sounds, under several aliases like Loudon Kleer, Luther Miek, Beat Therapy and LK. and last but not least, he is also known for his co-productions with artists like The Advent, Industrialyzer, Michaelangelo, DJ Slot among others.\r\n\r\nHis unique sound, taste, and technique, granted him a position on some of the best mega events like; Awakenings, Chateau Techno, TGV (The Netherlands), Evolve (Canada), Nature One, Syndicate, Ruhr in Love (Germany), Rock in Rio (Portugal), Technolandia (Portugal), Aquasella, (Spain), Liberty White (Belgium), Decibel (Holland), Global Vision Festival (France) & Apokalypsa (Czech Republic).\r\nA.Paul has rocked some of the hottest clubs like; Tresor, U60311, Lehmann (Germany), Sullivan Room (USA), Fabrik , Makumba, Row 14, Moog, Industrial Copera (Spain), Perron, Panama, Poema (The Netherlands), Locomia , Rocks, Kremlin, Pacha (Portugal), Qube (Italy), Inox Club (France) & many more.",

A dual whose patent is an extreme perfectionism in their mixtures and a constant awareness with the surrounding generated by their sounds which are mainly techno minimal. Soon both started to be in touch with the electronic context. “Branco” very much influenced by Pink Floyd – pioners of less convencional sounds and electronic arranjments. “XS” as soon as techno bursted in Portugal started to think of electronic music only. Diogo, “XS”, started djing very soon. In the last 8 years he as been gaining experirence in some famous houses like the Alabastro, in the Algarve, and Green Hill in Foz do Arelho. Different influences but the same passion for the electronic sounds gathered them in 2004, the Deep Soul dual was born. Highly influenced by the man they consider their guru Loco Dice and by the german electronic scene, Deep Soul started their residency at the Office Club in Caldas da Rainha back in 2005. The reception was warmful. Since that they have been playing in several places. Every new performance stands out the reason why they do this: “to feel a positive feedback from the audience is the greatest reward for our work. The more the audience cheers us the more we will take on this task of creating new and improved sounds”. Always keeping up with the newest technologies, tecniques and new releases, they spend long hours in their bunker: a retire full of high-tech where they create mixtures and search for new sounds to include in their creations. “Branco” took on the first LogicPro course certificated by Apple in Portugal, because there is much to keep up with in this area. Nowadays they have their residency at Bar do Bruno in Baleal (Peniche) but they will take on several appearances in many nights and events throughout thew country always with loads of energy in their performances and a good amount of soul in every single one of their creations. ..\r\nDeep Soul already had touched with some international artists of top like: Dubfire, Steve Lawler, Pan-Pot, David Squillace, Marc Houle, Heidi, Shonky, Mathias Meyer, Peter Bailey, Richie Santana... Portuguese artists: Dj Vibe, Expander, Stereo Addiction, Heartbreakers, Diego Miranda, Pete tha Zouk, Nelson Flip, kenny, LM Conection, Hugo Santana and many others... ..\r\nStay tuned!\r\n",

He has the merit of having approximated dance music to mainstream in a magical way, where, through the music, he has accomplished a great international prominence. \r\n\r\nDiego Miranda´s amazing track as Dj initiated when he was fourteen years old, through much stronger sonorities. Since early years, Diego earned recognition in the portuguese set, alongside with the very best national and international Djs. \r\n\r\nHe won several awards, which recognize his excellence as Dj. Dance Club Awards and Portugalnight Awards in the category of “DJ Revelation” in 2006 are examples of awards he won. Diego Miranda also won two gold albums with “Olá Love 2 Dance” (2006) and “Portugalnight” (2007). \r\n\r\nDiego Miranda has played in some of the best parties and festivals in the world, as “MTV Shakedown”, “Creamfields”, “Rock in Rio” or “Sensation White”, among others. He began an important international path in 2009 with “Ibiza for Dreams” hit, having since then accomplished an unequaled statute, which led him to play in great clubs all over the world. For example, he played several times in “Ushuaia Beach Hotel”, on summer of 2011 and, more recently, in the world’s best club, according to Dj Mag, “Green Valley” (Brasil). \r\n\r\nNowadays, Diego Miranda is considered as one of the strongest Djs in Iberian Peninsula, as result of his unforgettable and memorable performances, which led the audience, night after night, to ecstasy. \r\n\r\nOn Septmber, 2011, Diego Miranda became one of the few Djs/producers in the world being recognized by his work through a nomination to the most prestigious award in the music world, the EMA – MTV Awards, in Belfast. This nomination, besides recognizing the quality of his work, contributed significantly to the appreciation of dance music in Portugal and in the world. \r\n\r\nAlso in 2011, Diego Miranda was invited to produce and edit the first album of originals of one of the most important clubs in the world, the “Ushuaia Beach Hotel Ibiza”. \r\n\r\nIn the last two years, Diego Miranda almost figured on top 100 Djs in the world, by Dj Mag, reaching respectively the positions 101 e 108. \r\n\r\nHe produced hits like “Ibiza for Dreams feat. Liliana”, “Sunshine with Villanova feat. David Cruz” or “Girlfriend feat. Ana Free” that were number 1 for weeks on the charts of national radios and figured in the world´s top 10 hits, according to MTV Brazil. \r\n\r\nDiego Miranda as a producer showed, once again, the great quality of his work, with the hit \"Born Slippy\", which ended up making part of the album PACHA de Ibiza, 2013 and was deeply applauded by the public. \r\n\r\nMeantime, he released songs like “She’s the one feat. Gamp’s Morgan”, “Say Goodbye feat. Stephenie Coker” or “Take Your Time with brazilian producer Antonio Eudi”. \r\n\r\nLater this year, Diego Miranda is going to release his new album, only with originals that reflect his way of life. Many national and international prestigious artists are taking part of this new work, as Peetah Morgan, Ester Campos, Irina Popa, Kate Abreu, David Cruz, Orlando Santos Mc D’Queen and Nuno Guerreiro. \r\n\r\nAssuming the evolution and mutation of the dance music as an integral part thereof, it is natural that his sets, always different, float from vocal hits to harder beats, through a solid rhythmic base, of electronic and progressive influences, filled with organic elements. Diego Miranda has surprised and has created his own path as a producer, but it is on the dance floor where we can feel his exclusivity and unique style. His performances are characterized by an unmistakable and profound kick, which transform the listener on his diehard fan. Diego Miranda has a really busy schedule, not only filled with national clubs and festivals but also with his tour in Brazil and performances in other countries like Japan, Greece, Mozambique, Luxembourg, Angola, Spain and Macau. Diego Miranda is music! \r\n\r\nKeeping up in a fantastic phase of explosion, Diego Miranda is an artist who does not let anything or anyone indifferent to its passage, due to his absolute necessity of winning through his music and an unmistakable style. \"The best is yet to come\" is the motto that Diego Miranda applies to every moment of his life. He cannot live without his passion and it is that passion as a spell of magical emotions that we can feel, beat after beat, during his performances. From the studio to the dance floors and from the dance floors to the studio, Diego Miranda, has become one of the world magicians of dance, crossing all boarders.",

He played again in 1996 at some friends parties and two years later he made his first work concerning dance scene when he was invited to play in a Bar called Motar Bar, which was next to his house. In this Bar he started his career and after that he had never stopped performing in several different places, since houses with more commercial tendencies to houses with more hard, electro or even minimal tendencies, namely:\r\nAmerican Bar; Carolo Bar; Hot&Cold caffe; Game Club; Must caffe; Raio-X caffe; Ovnis; Spirit Club; Industrial caffe; Vintage; Be Smart club; Nova Era caffe; House Club; Mitto club; Swing Club; Among others...\r\n\r\nOther events:\r\nHe participated in the conquest Breakthru DJs promoted by Nova Era Radio, where he successfully reached the half finals;\r\nDancin Days;\r\nDJ and Friends;\r\n\r\nDuring these works he played not only with some of the most prestigious names of the national and international dance scene but also with some who became shortly after that well known, for example:\r\nPaul Jay, Rigi, Hugo Pereira, Filipe M, Triplex, Español, Sergio Castro, DJ Charlie, Po Serginho, Miss Blondie, Peter R, Paulo Remix, BsK, Ana Feel, DJ X-Cess, Miguel Tika, PC-Lux, Roguie K, Mondego Deep, Dubsoul, Freaki n’Dub, Da Cruz, Andre Neto, Duotech, Mister A, Mindskape, Steven, DJ Phil, DJ Smile, Freskitos, Frank Maurel, Carlos Fauvrelle, DJ Jiggy, Mr.Kindly Brooks, Pete tha Zouk, Luca Ricci, Sandy Rivera, Pablo Ceballos, And so on...\r\n\r\nWith these he always tried to learn something new and improve his technique.\r\nDJ Bruno R builds his sets mainly with House Music. Besides this he likes to express a happy and strong melodic sound, which is perfectly connected to his mood inside the cabin. However he can also reach the electrical and minimal ranges, which he has been exploring in the last year and a half.\r\n\r\nAs he uses to say -what I like most and gives me great pleasure is to see, from the inside of the cabin, the people dancing and feeling unique sensations when they hear the music I play !! -\r\n\r\nAt this moment he performs weekly at two permanent places, one at the Hot&cold caffe and the other at the House Club. Besides working as a freelancer he is also involved in two projects in the Dj and Dance Music area.\r\nMoreover he has embraced the project -NV DJ-s- and he is preparing himself to enter in the production world at the beginning of the present year.\r\n",

Duarte Araújo) was born into music and it was inevitable that he would grow up breathing it and making it a part of himself. Son of a drummer, multi-instrumentalist and co-founder of the independent record label Meifumado, music has always been part of his life. \r\n\r\nDuarte was stage musician for one of the most important underground punk-rock bands from Portugal, Mão Morta; drummer for the indie-pop band, Um Zero Amarelo; and between 2009 to 2014 dedicated himself almost exclusively to the label, as music executive, and to The Zany Dislexic Band, a jazzy jam band with 13 releases where he played guitar, bass and drums. \r\n\r\nIn the mid 90s his interest in electronic music began to grow with labels such as Warp, Ninja Tune or Mo'Wax, but two records in particular - Hardfloor's \"Respect\" and \"Musik\" from Plastikman - made him quickly succumb to the techno culture. An eclectic DJ and a dreamer, Duarte is a name associated with various dance floors in northern Portugal. He was resident DJ for over a decade at Insólito, in Braga (1999-2010), where his beats are known best, still remembered by those who were there as having been way ahead of their time.\r\n\r\nAfter a season in his lab and private clubbing, D.NOTE is now working on his own productions bringing us the perfect match between djing and live act, mixing and remixing pure minimal techno, in other words: \r\n“don't play what's there, play what's not there.”",

Thereby he influences the crowds at a bar, club or large scale event, with his eclectic DJ sets, versatile and energetic rhythmic, transmitting excitement and confidence.\r\n\r\nCYBERX, has its countless performances, having already shared sound booths with the most numerous different sounding names of \"national and world dance scene.\"\r\nApart from its activities in households, this artist has played a key role in some events and large capacity festivals.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 in partnership with his mate Dj Migusi, CYBERX founded \"LATITUDE RECORDINGS\" label, which is a national stamp. Their sound and focus is House music side, with electronic rhythms and progressive sounds, and has already highlighted some high performers worldwide.\r\n\r\nCurrently, musical production is one of its strongest points, both original and remixes, which got him invited to remix and edit themes for reputable national and international artists, regarded by \"many\" as one of the new global era of Portuguese musical producers, his themes appear frequently in Dj Charts, Radio Shows and Top sales.\r\nAlso important to mention that CYBERX has already more than 100 tracks supported by some of the most respected DJs and producers worldwide.\r\n\r\nCYBERX already ventured to participate in some remix contests for Uner, Round Table Knights, among others, and had a positive feedback from publishers and other artists.\r\nThrough Dance Club magazine and in partnership with Kaos Records, remixed a D-Generation theme and won the contest. This work was published in a Kaos Records Essential Singles 3 compilation, and had some impact on the dancefloor.\r\n\r\nThis artist intends to hit all types of audience in the music industry, so he decided to join his brother Sidrhythm by the studio name \"PLASTIC RAFTBUS\" on a more Techy, Deep and Housie project and to his performances on a more Funky, Club House and Nu Disco uses his new alter ego \"REAL MAJESTIC\" which currently has a weekly Radio Show on reputable Azorean CANAL FM radio.\r\n\r\nSince 2009 until the present day works at Ruido Audiovisuais studios, headquartered in Cascais and in Ponta Delgada, he lessons courses in music production and djing due to his recognized work.\r\n\r\nCurrently, he is one of the Dance TV / Sic Radical events selected djs working alongside with Dj The Fox and others, also touted by Fiesta Productions (Portugal Continental - Alien) and Glussy Productions (Azores and Madeira archipelagos) and now exclusively in Bulgaria by Novabeat.\r\n\r\nAs the sky is not the limit, Cyberx created in late 2012 and later founded the Portuguese label “MINAR RECORDS”, the label that already has massive support from big names in the world, since it is a publisher focused and with features identical to Toolroom, Great Stuff, Drumcode and Minus.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly a DJ / Producer to highlight, both in his Dj Set actions, as also its musical productions, experience, technical quality, and interactivity with the public are tools to develop a night of success and willingness at a club or an event.",

First, you don't feel menaced by it, you feel pretty enticed by it, really. But then you start noticing another layer. And that one brings knifes. And there's something spookier about this drums then you first realized, right? Yeah.\r\n\r\nThat's the result of 15+ years producing. DarkSunn doesn't need to show off his weapons. He will just subtly introduce them to you and progressively reach for your skin. Quite like a seasoned wolf.",

  "artist_bio": "Calapez is not your average DJ / Producer. He likes techno and house, but he likes it weird and complex. He's not convinced about all this \"the first minute I saw a record I fell in love with DJing\" thing. He's strictly into vinyl as he's shortsighted and can not look at how much time is left on the Traktor interface anyway...\r\nHe'll play the music he wants to play and nothing else. Why should it be any different?Calapez (born Lisbon, Portugal, 1980) had piano lessons when we was a kid, but music didn’t feel like destiny at the time (although now he thanks mom and dad that he’s had them). He went on to do photography and video, topping it off with a chemistry graduation at university.Curiously it was at that point that Calapez decided that lab work wasn’t his thing, and DJing (which he had been doing for some time, in a slightly random way) and producing seemed like a much better idea, heading off to London to learn the way of the producer.\r\nManuel Calapez story in techno, once back in Portugal, begins in partnership with Filipe “Jackspot” Furão, teaming up as Internal Sync. Together they’ve wandered around Techno, Minimal and House, getting releases on labels like Datapunk, Klang Gymnastik, Fortek or Plasteline, remixing people like Tristy Nesh and Access Denied.\r\nHis solo debut came on Florian Meindl/Koletzki’s FLASH digital, getting a track (“It strikes me as a Piano”) in the new Flash compilation series. It’s still techno, but with a house feeling approach, as it was more clearly shown afterwards on his first Troia Release, “Trespassing”. It can also get more abstract (check “Late Again” on Meleon Music) or deep (“Fridge door” on Keep On Records), or plain house feel, and that's what the \"You Know Better\" EP stands for.\r\nTechno is his main feel, and his record \"Flight Case\" on Weave Music got to be Raveline Mag, Techno Record of the month in August 2009.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalapez has played at:\r\nTresor, Pick-Nick, Pulp Mansion, Ritter Butzke (Berlin), Subway Club (Cologne), Dimuschi (Paris), Lux, Europa (After-hours), Frágil, Lounge, LEFT (Lisboa), Maus Hábitos, Plano B, Passos Manuel and Triplex (at Porto), ADN (Setúbal), NB (Viseu), Amo-te Meco, Amo-te Chiado, Pop.up bar, Texas Bar (Lisboa), Duplex, Lusco-Fusco Bar (Viseu). He played as well at Festival das Músicas do Mundo (Sines), Festival-X, Camp'05 Festival and Festival Danças com Livros (in Montemor-o-Novo), Experimenta Design, Centro Cultural de Belém and Lisbon's Museum of Ancient Art (M.N.A.A. - Museum's day).\r\n\r\nHe's also one half of Internal Sync (teaming up with Jackspot), having played all arround Portugal (including BOOM Festival 2008), and with live and dj sets in Berlin, Paris and Athens. Releases on Klang Gymnastik, Fortek, Datapunk, Plasteline, Kritik Recs. ...\r\n\r\nBesides this he was the founder of Noite CD-R (http://www.noitecdr.net), a special night where non-edited producers showed their music in a club type sound system. These were work sessions, the general rehearsal of tracks: checking sound levels, bass strength, voice clarity and also, observing the public reaction.",

He has a commitment to diversity by exploring any particular style of techno. Strong, progressive and groovy beats are the hallmark of the DJ SLOT style, when combined with his technical skill it creates a steady increase in intensity, pace and energy that infect the audience leading them through a mesmerizing trip and giving no break to people on the dancefloor. Track selection is one of his strengths! Deliberately makes use of improvisation, provoking interaction. Sometimes it is accompanied by an electro or by breakbeat sounds creating atmospheres leading the audience to another dimension. The creativity, enthusiasm and variation lead to every gig being a different party, making each performance unique.\r\n\r\nDuring his long connection to the agency Dreamwork marked a permanent presence on the national circuit of the highest level playing in  the most emblematic clubs like: Pacha, Rocks, Locomia, Via Invicta, etc.., Also to playing in some clubs in Spain: Octopus, Joy Eslava, Cocoon, Yasta, Metropolis, etc..\r\nDJ SLOT had the pleasure of acting alongside top international artists and djs: Richie Hawtin aka Plastikman, Jeff Mills, The Advent, Carl Cox, Laurent Garnier, Dave Clarke, Masters at Work, Kenny Hawkes, Eric Morillo, Stacy Pullen among many others.\r\n\r\nA memorable moment was undoubtedly the appointment by the magazine Dance Club for the \"DANCE AWARDS 2001\" because of the impact that his music was having on the dance floor, having earned most votes in his category won him the prize \" Techno 2001 Dj Revelation \", a distinction which finally cemented his position on the national scene, confirming the durability and progression of his career, this ended up having repercussions in neighboring Spain with DJ SLOT regularly going performing in various clubs and events.\r\n\r\nAt this stage DJ SLOT was also linked to import vinyl to one of the finest specialty stores in the country, Mushroom Records in Coimbra, where he also acquired most of his music, and later he became part of the largest chain for importing vinyl in Portugal, the Bimotor Records.\r\n\r\nIn his ceaseless quest for perfection and artistic growth, he felt the need to extend his art to music creation, and finally he assumed the role of producer. His main influences are A.Paul, Speedy J, Chris Liebing, The Advent, Adam Beyer, Marco Carola, Industrialyzer, Ben Sims and some more.\r\n\r\nIn this area, his dedication is ceaseless, with his debut \"Mantis EP\" released by Naked Lunch Records, owned by the well-known Portuguese A.Paul, followed by \"Interzone EP\", their second release, this time by Mastertraxx Records, owned by the renowned british techno producer Mike Humphries.\r\nHis experience in the work of DJing and production, has led to the creation of his own label, Platinium Records, a project for which new material is expected soon... work in progress...",

  "artist_bio": "DJ Vibe or Antonio \"To\" Pereira, started mixing at the early age of 15 years old, back in 1983, when got his first ever club gig at Lisbon's Bataclan. At that time he was helping out in his father's shop in downtown Lisbon,  a vital place where all the DJs would get the most recently imported 12inches.DJ Vibe started mixing early. It was back in 1983 that António \"Tó\" Pereira got his first ever club gig at Lisbon’s Bataclan spot. Today he still dedicates his 30 talented years of music to all of us crowd people!\r\nSo in the 80’s he was helping his Father at his Lisbon downtown record shop, a vital place for all the Djs to get the most recent imported 12\"s vinyl records. Since then DJ Vibe has been involved in all kinds of music activities from Dj to Production as well as playing live on Portuguese Band LX 90 or remixing other Artists. Considered by everyone the most sought after and well known of the Portuguese Djs, Vibe had been also involved in the launch of the most important Clubs in Portugal in the last 20 years. Back to the 80's, he was invited to open club Plateau in Lisbon (1985/1986) a venue that would change Lisbon nightlife style playing to a very selective people like Artists, Cinema and Fashion Lovers. Records from Matt Bianco, Grace Jones, Quango Quango and The Cure were played regularly on this place that soon became the hot spot in town and very fast became too small for such a big demand of people that for any reason didn't wanted to miss those amazing parties.\r\n\r\nIn February 1988 DJ Vibe was once again invited to open the legendary Lisbon Club Alcântara Mar. It was a much bigger room (nearly 1500 pax) and initially got extremely busy on the weekends going until 9-10 am (a very fresh and new club scenario in Portugal). Vibe was also caught in London at the time by the Acidhouse Explosion and the music changes happening there. Tracks from Artists like \"Phuture\", \"Adonis\", and \"Fast Eddie\" were first introduced in Portugal at the time. Classic and unforgettable moments at this Club when, in the middle of the night, he dropped stuff like Nina Simone \"My baby just care for me\", Nina Hagen \"African Reggae\" and Eric B and Rakim \"Paid in Full\", to finish later in the morning with the new more progressive sounds. Later, at this Club (1993/1994) underground smash Underground Sound of Lisbon “So Get Up” (co-written with Rui Da Silva) was heavy championed by Lisbon DJ Luis Leite turning this track into the most one ever played there, and also being the last record to be played before the venue demolition.\r\n\r\nIn 1988’s \"Summer of Love\" Vibe joins the Kremlin club in Lisbon where he played his longest ever residency. Nearly 7 years. The Kremlin worked every night of the week except Sundays with DJ Vibe playing all night long. His love for the marathon sets probably started there. Kremlin was the first ever Club in Portugal to set an After Hours party. The Club closed at 4am to re-open again at 6am. Sometimes drinks were served on the street as the crowd waited for the re-open at the door outside. DJ Vibe \"Bombs\" at this Club were Moby \"Age of Love\", Joey Beltran \"Energy Flash\" and Snap \"The power\" to name only a few. Muzik Magazine UK first edition named DJ Vibe and the Kremlin “A Paradise Called Portugal\". His excellent mixing ability and style playing a wide range of Dance Music with his set had made him unique!\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the 90's Vibe joins Portuguese Indie/Pop/Rock band LX90, where he played the guitar and live samplers. Underground Sound of Lisbon production project is also launched with Rui Da Silva. He's also the first ever Portuguese DJ to remix local Rock/Pop bands like Ban and Radio Macau. USL had their smash hit “So Get Up” reach #1 in specialized charts around the World selling over 40.000 singles, and more than a million on compilations with Tribal America Records. Soon they had their stuff remixed by some of the most notorious Djs such as Danny Tenaglia and Junior Vasquez. Vibe, Tenaglia and Da Silva then cooperate on the NYLX project with vocals from Lula to produce the track \"Goosebumps\" in 1996. USL single \"Are you looking 4 me (in the backroom)\" introducing Celeda, bumped right into #35 at US \"Billboard\" Chart (March 1998) and won a position among the 75 singles of the year (1998) chosen by British Muzik Magazine in 2000. USL single \"The lights\" was considered one of Miami's top 10 tunes by UK DJMag and UK DJMixmag voted it single of the April edition. In 2004, Yoko Ono was #1 on the “Billboard” Dance Chart with the DJ Vibe’s remix “Everyman...Everywoman”.\r\n\r\nAfter four years in a row entering the DJMag Top100 Chart, DJ Vibe achieved the 40th place in the 2007 edition.\r\n\r\nAlso involved in Radio since 1994, DJ Vibe starts “Dance Music” show on National station Antena 3 (www.antena3.pt) together with Sofia Louro (Wicctofly DJ) in a 2 hour Saturday night live mix and music fresh white labels presentations. Today at the same station he keeps a different format and now called DJ Vibe Mix Show “Rotations”, which broadcast 1 hour every Saturday. It was also played abroad on Kiss 102/100 in England and on Carl Cox (2003) and John Digweed (2004) websites.\r\nBefore, Vibe had produced the daily show 4th Bairro to National Radio Comercial (1980). But his first artist solo radio show was on Radio Energia between 1991 and 1993, every Saturday night.\r\nSince 1998 he's a resident at Lux Frágil in Lisbon playing all night in the Club Disco, a monthly friday, turning his night into a real classic at the Club with crowds coming from all over Portugal to catch him there. Aside of being involved on the launch of the most important clubs in Portugal, Vibe was also a special guest on the most relevant events in the country. \r\nHe played or is a resident at the world's most famous Clubs, including Stereo at Montreal (one of the best sound systems worldwide) for the last 4 years. His hard work and talent are recognized around the world.\r\nBy 2011 DJ Vibe launched his own club, in the Oporto city – Indústria Club, and where guests as Danny Tenaglia, OMID 16B, DJ Harvey, Laurent Garnier, Danny Krivit, Audiofly, Grandmaster flash, Nicole Moudauber, and so much more international and national Electronic Music names have been playing till today.\r\n\r\nAt the studio work, DJ Vibe “Global Grooves” was a CD's trilogy on Kaos Records which sold more then 45,000 copies in a small country like Portugal.\r\nNew releases include “You”, with Underground Sound of Lisbon vocalist Ithaka. Recent cooperation with Victor Calderone produced \"Tranzient\" and \"Muzik\", which are included on Stereo Sound 001, a CD compilation mixed by DJ Vibe. Unreleased Vibe productions Ibiza “Mosquito Polen” and “El Ayoun” are already included in many top DJ compilations.\r\n\r\nA remix of Portugal's most popular rock band Xutos and Pontapés and a upcoming DJ Vibe artist CD, more remixes and extended DJ sets to come, means that DJ Vibe will remain one of the most influential figures in House/Electronic Music of the past, present and future times, celebrating more than 30 years of a brilliant career.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides having been involved in the opening of the most important Clubs in Portugal, Vibe also was present in other events.

But it was with the start of the new millennium that Djadja chose Techno as the style that he most love and identify himself. \r\nWhen he was 15 he decided to take more seriously his love for Techno and just by himself, without any given knowledge or help, he took the first steps as a DJ and started to discover the innumerable possibilities that this art would had to offer him.\r\nIt was at Musicália’s 2003 edition (light, image and sound exposition) that Djadja had the chance to leave the room and play for a crowd. His effort paid off, having reached the 2nd place at the DJ’s competition.\r\nLater in 2005, Djadja won the DJ’s competition “I want to got to Techno Inside” promoted by Techno Inside, the biggest Techno events promoter in Portugal.\r\nDjadja has now shared the booth with great DJ’s like Jeff Mills, Charles Siegling AKA Technasia, Jesus del Campo, DJ Jiggy, DJ Link, T-Viruz… Beyond DJ’ing, he also dedicates himself to musical production (has taken an electronic music production course in 2002 at the old Dance Planet Lisbon store, actual MK2, having the top rated DJ and producer Zé Mig.L as his teacher).\r\nAt the year of 2011 the Techno world saw the launching of Djadja’s first EP with the invitation of the italian label Kontrol Records (Rome). The Blast EP features four powerfull Techno tracks approaching various sides of Techno. If Dark Punishment and Particle Blast show a more mental and psychedelic side of Techno, Running Alien Vírus and Hybrid are two peak hour Techno tracks where Djadja expresses his more energetic side, reflecting the power of his DJ sets as well. With this achievement Djadja is fully commited to continue the studio work and keep evolving as music producer.\r\nHis style is not very easy to define, therefore each DJ set will be different of the last one, adjusting himself and his music according to the mood and energy of the crowd, just like music production process, where the various genres of Electronic Music are explored. Influences from artists like Joey Beltram, The Advent, Jeff Mills, Plastikman, Eric Sneo, Adam Beyer, Chris Liebing, A.Paul, Zé Mig.L are always present… characterizing his DJ sets as powerfull and energetic, always with lots of rhythm. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeb Links:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Djadjapt\r\n\r\nhttp://soundcloud.com/djadja\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mixcloud.com/Djadja\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myspace.com/djadjapt\r\n\r\nhttp://www.beatport.com/artist/djadja/215598\r\n",

Very loyal to the electronic club culture since his early years, Ferro his now one of the key names of Portugal underground music scene.\r\n\r\nBorn in Lisbon, but raised in the Algarve since early days. After his 18th birthday he moved again to Lisbon, already attached to strong dance rhythm he had the opportunity to know a lot of ones like him looking for a break true in the dance scene as well as establish his style to a bulky public. Question of Time, to the ones who remember, lead the way (without a doubt) to a lot of look-a-like companies of today.Being a part of a elite team he started to get requests to play in such places as: ZONA+, Coconuts, Plateau, Alcantara-mar and many others.\r\n\r\nHis later link with record shops was at Bimotor, were he was in charge for imports. Collectively with A.paul and Wogz a specific Portuguese label of techno was created - Squeeze Records was the name for this project. Squeeze #001 (A.paul & Ferro) was a smash, with the elevate appetite of the public; the correct music was released at the correct time. Compilation request followed.\r\n\r\nOutside Portugal boundaries the success was discreet but flourishing, the German distributor Neuton spread it thru Europe and DJs like Sven Vath, Chris Liebing and Hardfloor charted it. At a certain time, during the 'boom' of dance music in Portugal, X-Club recognized his work with a invitation to be one of the X artists, were he was able to set up is career. Places like Colombia and Slováquia, playing with such DJs as Carl Cox, Jeff Mills, Dave Clarke, Richie Hawtin, The Advent, Mike Dearborn, DJ Rush, Derrick Carter, Dave Angel, Darren Price, Stacey Pullen, DJ Sneak, Green Velvet, Josh Wink, Damon Wild, Steve Stoll, Adam Beyer, David Holmes and many others, are common to him.\r\n\r\nToday Ferro his label manager for ZONA MUSICA, respected Portuguese label/distributor of such as Mute, Novamute, Future Groove, V2 and many more. His love for production it's still alive, and he delivers his new work regularly to Onhcet and Genesis, also keeping his agenda full with gig inside and out of Portugal",

  "artist_bio": "DUAL MINDS\"Os Dual Minds são a música do Nélson e da Gy. \r\nDisco a disco, aquilo que começou em 2007 como duas pessoas que gostam de música a tocarem juntos, hoje, vai muito para além disso. Nélson Marinho é dj desde 2003. A Nyah Gy é-o um pouco mais tarde. Se o Nélson procura na pesquisa e na técnica a resposta para a dança, a Gy mostra discos que a fazem dançar seja qual for o ano que esteja na label. \r\nO que os torna uma dupla rara no panorama nacional: não só ficamos cientes do caminho que a música levou até chegar aqui como também o fazemos dançando. \r\nNão há muitos por cá que façam isto tão bem como os Dual Minds. E não os há porque não há muita gente na música de dança em Portugal como o Nélson e a Gy. Muito menos a tocar juntos. Por isso, não é de admirar que já tenham mostrado a sua música por Lisboa, Porto, Guimarães, Santo Tirso ou… por aí. E não será de admirar que o continuem a fazer por muitos mais anos, na certeza de que, havendo discos novos a sair ou antigos para procurar, há coisas novas para contar, um disco de cada vez.\"\r\n\r\nTexto : José Belo",

Setting a remarkably strong, intense, and evolutionary path, Nox’s musical line combines a number of influences, trends and different fringes.\r\n\r\nHis journey through music is characterised by a highly individual and personal stamp of its own, whether in his technical approach, whether in his emotional relationship with music that is transferred to his main workplace, the dancefloor.\r\n\r\nIn late 2000, Nox became a freelancer, and in 2011 he began the project once known for Fuse Lx.\r\n\r\nProductions that led him to remix artists such as DJ Vibe, Oscar L, Phunk Investigation and releasing music on labels like Magna Recordings, Kaos and most recently, fresh04 recordings, can be added to this fruitful journey.\r\n\r\nAbroad, he travelled to places like Spain, Morocco, France, Switzerland, England, Sweden, Albania, and Poland, also where he took part in acclaimed and renowned events such as WMC and ADE.\r\n\r\nNox is an eternal music lover and a new technologies aficionado.

  "artist_bio": "Tiago Barros, birth name of DJeff Afrozila, was born in a cultural crossroad. If Lisbon, Portugal, was the city that welcomed him into this world in 1984, his roots lie in Africa, on his father’s Cape Verde and on his mother’s Angola. Growing up in a capital city such as Lisboa meant being exposed to pop music of the 80s: Michael Jackson, Europe, Michael Bolton, Brian Adams, and many others, but living in an African heritage house also meant a close connection to the African roots with bands and musicians such as Kassav, Tabanka Jazz, Livity, Grace Evora, Eduardo Paim, among others. From his older sister came his first contact with electronic music - Robin S, Reel 2 Real, Sizequeen, Daft Punk, Armand Van Helden – and it was an instant and everlasting crush.At fifteen, by 1999, DJeff starts going to club matinées in a true establishment of Lisbon’s club culture, Bauhaus in Estoril. While his friends dance, DJeff observes and learns with the DJ, and from here on there’s a love story to be told. His next step was buying a mixer to use with two Discmans; he collects dance music and researches DJs until he finds his DJ reference of all times, Erick Morillo. The New York DJ would be DJeff’s ultimate inspiration. \r\nOn school parties and in family parties DJeff practised his skills and in 2002 he has the opportunity to learn from a more experienced DJ. In this course DJeff learns how to mix with CD players and with classic turntables. His talents and musicality are so many and shine so bright that he’s immediately invited to work as a resident DJ in the club. From then on DJeff started playing as a freelance artist.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 he finishes his degree in Graphic Arts and moves to Luanda, Angola, where he lives until today. In his new country, his reputation precedes him, and he’s invited to present a TV show called Made In Angola. It is also in the Angolan heat that his studio and production work begins, a creative output where DJeff always tries to convey his African roots, and in 2010 his first release – collaboration with DJ Silyvi titled “Canjika” – is released through Pandora Records. His remixes and original tracks gain momentum and serious support from international DJs and in the support list Louie Vega’s name stands out.\r\n\r\nMore tracks are released: \"Tambuleno\", \"Noba\", \"Malembe\" , \"Sikama\" - NULU Records (Anane Vega /Antonello Coghe), \"Nawe\"- Soulgasm Music (The Wizard Brian Coxx /Alias Rythm), \"Mwini\" - Offering Records (Boddhi Satva), \"Rollin My Way\" - Tribe Records (Zepherin Saint). \r\n\r\nBy 2011 it was time for DJeff Afrozila to create his own label – Kazukuta Records – a home for his music, for new African talents but also the first electronic music label from Angola. DJeff is both a leader and an inspiration. Kazukuta is growing on the international scene and has a weekly radioshow broadcasted worldwide through www.qhradio.nl every Wednesday from 9 to 10PM. \r\n2013 saw the release of his much anticipated album – Soldier Ascension – out of which several songs were played and remixed by several artists. Early 2015 saw Djeff Afrozila’s performance at the infamous Boiler Room and the national radio in Portugal, Mega Hits, picking his bimonthly sets for a radioshow.",

  "artist_bio": "Hugo Villanova (born as Hugo Ricardo Pinto, 15 March 1983)is a Portuguese DJ and Producer. Currently resides in Lisbon, Portugal.In recent explosion of talent and DJs that the music industry has seen in recent years, there are very few that can show a solid and extensive career. Hugo Villanova has cultivated throughout his career several successes. Furthermore, there are few DJs who can actually attest the kind of dedication to quality, something that Hugo Villanova has defended stoutly. \r\nMore than an artist, he has been a leader, an experienced producer with his own style. \r\nHugo Villanova has defended over its own unique breed of electronic music more than any other, not following fads or trends but what he has in his soul, and this has made ​u8203 him see his music being played countless times by DJs radios and even television. \r\nWith a discography that currently has more than 30 original singles published in numerous national and international record labels, worked with some of the best national artists, getting to be in every radio nationally. With Diego Miranda signed the hit 'JUST FLY' that quickly reached the tops of the most heard songs in Portugal and the year after, \"Only with the Sunshine\" with the vocals of David Cruz. \r\nHis history began in the 90s when techno music was at its peak in Portugal. Inspired by artists like Laurent Garnier, Plastikmen, Robert Miles and others led to what he himself saw them as pioneers in something that virtually no one do at the time in Portugal, the electronic music. The taste for production, comes from kid, starting to build the first sounds with little existing machines and the software at the time, with only 15 years. Some years passed, acquiring a wide experience in terms of production and studio but his love for music became a passion for performance. Met a few years later, Dj's of great national name, which gave him the courage to, acted live and to show the world the knowledge he has about everything that concerns the Djing / Production. Your DJ SET's are the result of its ability to externalize and share feelings creating a synergy with those who attend their performances. Already was resident DJ at some of the best clubs nationwide, including the mythical nightclub Kadoc Algarve. Known for his love of music, his dedication to his fans, and his commitment to always offer quality, he built a reputation of class and good charisma that is often lacking in the modern music scene, and proved one of the few artists is proudly true to his principles. \r\nIt is fair to say that Hugo Villanova remains one of the most active artists and producers in the dance scene today. Uncompromising and driven by a relentless passion to offer the best for those who enjoy it, Hugo continues to be one of the forces that define the dance music for many years to come.\r\n\r\nDIFF RECORDS\r\n@diffrecords\r\nwww.facebook.com/diffrecords\r\n--\r\nHUGO VILLANOVA\r\nwww.hugovillanova.com\r\nfacebook.com/hugovillanovaofficial\r\nmyspace.com/hugovillanova\r\ntwitter.com/hugovillanova\r\nyoutube.com/user/hugovillanova\r\n--",

Some influential bands for me were Depeche Mode, Pink Floyd, Pixies, The Doors -  you can see the diversity. Then electronic dance music came along and changed my life forever.\r\nOf course i’d been listening to that since the late 80's (Pump up the Jam, anyone?), with the whole acid house movement and mainstream bands incorporating those sounds… but it was really in 1994 that it really hit me bigtime.\r\n\r\nI used to go to a bar by that time, and a cd came out from Kaos Records with a lot of cool music, but especially the big hit So Get Up, from Underground Sound of Lisbon (Dj Vibe & Rui da Silva).\r\nWe couldn’t play it during normal hours, because that was “crazy music”, but after the bar was closed, me, the bartender and some friends would stay there, just listening to it over and over again. It was magical, so different from anything else, so profound, full of possibilities. This was clearly the future…\r\nSo i started listening to this kind of music, and shortly started attending my first rave parties, which were huge, with a great vibe and a lot of ilegal substances going around!\r\n\r\nI didn’t plan on being a dj at first, i was in it for the ride and the love for the music. But around early 1997, i found myself going to Lisbon to the record shops, buying some vinyl records – i had to have those tracks myself. So, logical consequence, around a year later in 1998, the bug bit me and i had to start djing – it was almost a physical desire i had. With a lot of effort, i bought my first mixer and set of Technics turntables (i miss them!), and started learning on my own.\r\n\r\nAfter some months, i played my first live set ever, an afterhours party with lots of friends there. It was a technical disaster, of course, but i was among friends, so it was ok… Things developed from there, i practiced lots, started getting more and more gigs, and by 2000 i was playing 2 times a week as a freelancer, in a lot of places. Many memorable nights and sets followed through the years, and a lot of fun too. I like playing long sets, starting more on the deep side, going techier and finishing with big room epic sounds.\r\nI like doing long smooth mixes, throwing in the occasional effect, acappella or mixing technique. Also had a 1 year experience as a resident dj, and a 5 years, 2-hours weekly mix-show on the radio, called Groovy Sessions.\r\n\r\nI enjoy and play most styles of house, deep, tech, progressive, tribal, minimal, techno, etc.\r\nI hate when dj’s just play that one mini-sub-sub-genre and dis everything else – until there’s a new hip mini-sub-sub-genre and then they start playing that and dissing the one they were playing before! Gotta respect the roots, i say. Bring on the new, but don’t trash the old.\r\n\r\nPRODUCER\r\n\r\nIt was also around 1997/98 that i started playing around with making my own music.\r\nThe first program i had was Magix Music Maker, i think it was version 1 or 2. Very basic, so i quickly became proficient at it, and finished quite a few techno tracks with it. There’s a couple of them i still remember, they were very cool, i wish i still had them around in some form. Then i got Rebirth and went to acid heaven – it was dificult doing anything in it that wasn´t acid music, but it also taught me how to work with drum machines and synthesizers and step sequencing and it was a lot of fun.\r\nBut i did this mainly for fun, had no real aspirations other than that, and my busy schedule of djing didn’t leave me much time for it.\r\nCue some years forward, 2004, and the production bug bit me hard this time, started learning more about it, went through a course, got my first published track on a cd from Dance Club magazine that showcased the new talents in 2005 and never looked back.\r\nThese days i have many released tracks and remixes in several labels (check out the discography page) and i’m pretty much an hardcore audio geek by now! My sequencer of choice now is Ableton Live, i love it and i’m probably gonna have many posts in the blog related to it.\r\nIn late 2009 i started a collaboration with fellow artist Marcus Vandell. Our project is called Across Digital and we have many cool tracks both finished and in the works!\r\n\r\nSOUND DESIGNER\r\n\r\nI’m also the owner and producer of Groove Packs, a company that makes Live Packs for the Ableton sequencer and also Sample Packs that can be used in any sequencer. Check it out! I also do beta testing, sound design and content creation for several companies including Ableton, FXPansion, Team DNR & The Cable Guys.\r\n\r\nTEACHER\r\n\r\nI’m also an electronic music production & djing trainer at the Dancefloor Academy school in Lisbon.",

In 1995 with only 15 years old he was part of a big radio show dedicated to the promotion of new styles and musical tendencies, responsible for the big push of the electronic scene in Portugal... In the summer of 1999 he was part of Extra Agency which gave him the possibility to perform regularly allowing him to conquer a huge collection of nationwide emerging fans in the electronic environment. These fans were the support and incentive that Babalu needed to develop his strong and intelligent work. In 2000 with his residency in one of the most hot clubs in the center region of Portugal, Ultimatum Club, he settled his value and showed his outstanding ability with various equipments which in time awarded him several invites to perform all over the country. This fast break of chances allowed him to open a record store, X-Records, and gave him the opportunity to be close in touch with all the most recent musical news worldwide. In the last years Babalu has given proofs on the production of his own ideas, with several tracks edited in labels such as Meridua Rec (PT), Afroboogie (EAU), Bellarine Rec (AUT), Magna Rec (PT), Substance Rec (USA) or Tanira Rec (PT). His work has been so fresh to the dance scene that some of his works have been selected by artists like Chus & Ceballos (SPA) to be included in edited compilations. His known musical experience his reflected in his accurate mixing and his adaptation to the dance floor which results in an always exciting and pleasant musical surprise. Babalu among the most respected, loved and requested Portuguese djs. His grooves and rhythms have placed him alongside with some of the best professionals like Luke Slater (UK), Marco Carola (ITA), UMEK (SLO), Samuel L. Session (SWE), Ben Sims (UK), Marco Bailey (BUL), Henrik B (SWE), Valentino Kanzyani (SLO), Red Head (BUL), Oliver O.

Instead of following a lawyers career he devoted himself, totally and exclusively, to music.\r\n\r\nHe started as a DJ, but soon after, in 2000, founded Flow Records. This platform allowed him to invest on his own musical line, deep, steadfast and profound stories with surprisingly voluptuous and stimulating melodies. The label gave him a chance to interpret, even further, his groovy road of thinking and allowed him to travel continually all over the globe.\r\n\r\nFrom 2000 to 2004 all his dedication was distinguished by four prizes as Best Trance DJ at annual Dance Club Awards, organized by Dance Club Magazine, the only and respectful Portuguese Electronic Music Magazine.\r\n\r\nIn 2006, has created Flow Vinyl for a housier approach, setting pace on what he plays nowadays, having his releases been supported by the top jocks.\r\nApart from that, he continues his strive for top class open minded parties in his motherland, leading to the start of the renowned Flow parties, blending progressive house, progressive trance and even minimal techno, inviting talents to Portugal like Audiojack, Dousk, Minilogue, Extrawelt, Mashtronic, Luke Dzierzek, Motion, Antix/Fiord to name a few\r\n\r\nWhat more to say of this influential and foremost pillar of worlds electronic music stage?!

But that’s only half of the story; His musical talent also flourished with recent productions receiving widespread support from other Dj’s and Clubbers alike.\r\nIn the summer of 2010 DJ Lama formed the “Fenix Project“ - followed by the production of his first song “Plugin” a fusion of Progressive and Tech House combined with elements from other music styles and which received excellent reviews in all performances.

In fact “Fenix Project” is synonymous of quality & integrity, reborn from the ashes.\r\nDJ Lama performed nearly in every club in Portugal. Top to the bottom. Places like the mythic Alcantra-Mar, Pacha, Vatican, Kremelin and many others… He became resident DJ at Hipnose Productions where he remained for several years performing at major festivals such as “Optimus Hype Meco”\r\nLama had some cool experiences playing abroad, like Ibiza, Italy, Brazil, Mozambique, London, India and a few others.  He had some key reviews from his live performances as “Fenix Project” both on his live and dj sets.\r\nHis great skills as a producer and DJ together with an impeccable taste gave him a strong Dj reputation in Portugal. He played with major dj´s such as Paul Taylor, Dick Trevor, Mike Maguire, Juno Reactor, Dimitri Nakov, Dino Psaras, Cydonia, Psycatron, D-Sens, Fiord, MOS, Audiojack. Pena, D-Nox & Beckers and many others.\r\nIn addition to his DJ skills and studio talents DJ Lama is together with Pena, the Manager and A&R of Flow-Records\r\nIn January 2013 will see released “Substance EP” from Micro Digital Records as well as an Album and other RMX’s for Flow- Records.\r\nStay tuned…\r\n",

It's a Deep House / Techno Portuguese producer.Fragoso, producer, sound technician, did a long journey since the ultimate click that induced himself to the passion from electronic music in the end of the 90's. \r\n\r\nSince that time, never  stopped creating, undertaking and influencing all the one's around him that shared the same passion. He absorved the musical residue from Detroit and Chicago, the Acid Jazz and Trip-Hop from UK, lived the Dark Tribal boom with influence of the synergy between Lisbon and New York, the minimalism from the end of the 90's typical from labels like Ohn.Cet as well the progressive house from the early days of millenium, not forgetting the groovy British Tech-House untill the existent fusions from the present.\r\n\r\nThis cultural journey lead Fragoso to not believe in a performance resumed by a single musical line and his background justify his belief. He's ecletic by nature, capable to oscillate between Housey Tribal and Funk influenced grooves in a warm summer afternoon as well to project his vision in a minimal journey at 4AM in a dark club or even to project sonical clusters provided with hipnotical melodies from Detroit or Chicago in a sunrise. If there's something that fill him up, is the oportunity to realize a trip and share it like  there was an ancestral ritual going on.",

  "artist_bio": "Expander, the founder of Soniculture, is known for following a path that strives away from dominating standards and for constantly seeking new approaches to electronic music, especially in what regards to techno. As dj, he has already performed in Europe’s main clubs and festivals and is considered the main reference for the underground scene in Portugal. He also plays frequently in the US, Canada and South America.There are all night sets that made history in the dance scene. From the mythical Larry Levan (Paradise Garage) to Ron Hardy (Music Box), or those golden days of Laurent Garnier at the Hacienda, everywhere in the world there are djs who affirm their identity, gather followers and give themselves to the dance floor with heart, feeling the energy. The all night sets of Expander at Op Art in Lisbon at the beginning of the decade 2000, proved to be a display of enormous talent and innovation, mixing several emerging music styles of electronic music: IDM, house, techno, trance and electro were the base of the crossover that would happen years after. Currently, and after a unique path, Expander is a dj, producer, promoter and label manager. He has performed all over the world and is a landmark for the portuguese avant-guard music scene.\r\n\r\nIn parallel with a university carrer and a professional in computer technology, Expander grew fuelled by his passion for music. With influences that range from Coil to Klink, from Einstürzende Neubauten to Maurizio, he began his professional carreer as a musician by joining the Journeys collective at the end of the 90s.\r\n\r\nAlways following the evolution of music he begins the Sonic project in 2002 and the Electro Poppers project with Nelson Flip, leading the electro/techno movement in Portugal. As a founder of Sonic he meant to create a solid platform for the promotion of new musical concepts regarding electronic music and present, at a regular basis, djs and musicians that were bringing new ideas to the scene. With the promotion of over 300 events in just nine years of existence and a summer festival that is moving towards its ninth edition, the re-baptized Soniculture can be regarded as one of the most active organizations in Portugal.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the musical offers from Soniculture and Expander’s talent led to the invitation from the famous label/agency/distributor Kompakt, in 2005, to be part of their roster. This was a giant leap in his career becoming on of the most famous portuguese djs worldwide.\r\n\r\nDuring these last years Expander has played internationally at some of the most important clubs such as Studio 672 in Cologne, Berghain in Berlin, Nitsa in Barcelona, Cargo in London, Flex in Vienna, Pulp in Paris, Sankeys in Manchester, D-Edge in S. Paulo, Dama de Ferro in Rio de Janeiro, Space in Ibiza and some of the most reputable electronic music festivals such as Santander Summer Festival and C/O Pop (in Cologne), both in 2005. Sonar 2004, in Barcelona, was one of the most unforgettable experiences and a serious boost in his career with the international press praising his performance at Sonar Village, the main area of Sonar by day: “radical change and big surprise. Dj Expander, starts the madness with a revigorating minimal techno set. The first truly dance set of the day…” - U-Blog (Belgium). “…Expander offered the first truly danceable set of the afternoon. And the crowd celebrated…” – El periódico (Spain). “…on the few moments where dance music invaded the area, the crowd became delirious. Portuguese dj Expande, one of the few responsible for these moments of explosion, should have gone home happy…” - MTV.com“. …it took Expander less than 20 minutes to transform the place into a magnificent dance floor. After 30 minutes it was closer to madness than to the calm place at the beginning of the afternoon.” – Electronic vision (France). “… DJ Expander and as well Francois K on Friday rocked the crowd and made all of the people move their asses to the rave beats...\" – De:bug (Germany)\r\n\r\nIn Portugal, he has performed in the most famous clubs such as Lux (where Soniculture has a monthly residency), Pacha, Vaticano, Industria, Gare, Via Latina and in festivals such as Anti Pop / Neo Pop and Boom, never conceding with commercialism and always being faithful to a musical path that is brave, innovative and futuristic.\r\n\r\nIn 2007, Expander released a mix-cd celebrating the anniversary of Soniculture and it was published with Dance Club magazine. This led to future releases such as “Five years of Sonic Culture”, that was part of the June edition in 2007, “Four years of Soniculture”, “Three years of Sonic Culture” and “Two years of Sonic Culture”, that were released with the editions of March 2006, February 2004 and 2005, respectively. After the third consecutive year being nominated best electro dj by the Dance Club Awards he finally won the prize.\r\n\r\nSucceeding the previous releases, “Mix | Dex |Efx” on Dance Club Sessions #1, saw the dawn of day and showed how Expander was talented and visionary as an artist. In this project, he created new tracks by mixing parts and clips of music from other artists and merging everything by the use of technology, leading to a voyage of around 80 mins through the realms of renovation.\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven the successes of the previous editions, Dance Club invited Expander once again to release the “9 years of Soniculture” mix-cd in February 2011.\r\n\r\nAs a label, Soniculture released its first split EP in 2005 with a track from Expander & Paul Kalkbrenner and another one from Misc. With Kompakt exclusive distribution, it has featured artists such as Gui Boratto, Kalkito aka Paul Kalkbrenner, Marc Houle, Alexander Kowalski, Midimiliz aka Extrawelt , Jake Fairley, Billy Dalessandro, Thinkfreak, Re:Axis, Anders Ilar & Fredrik Hedvall, Landberg & Jacobson and Chordian, among others, including Expander himself.\r\n\r\nAlong with his releases on Soniculture, Expander was also invited to do remixes for other labels. These are the cases of tracks such as “Lost Highways” by Pan/Tone (Cereal/Killers), “Synclair” for Basteroid and Ada (Areal), “Pixelize” for Frederic de Carvalho (Absolut Freak) and “In the Dark” for Billy Dalessandro (Siteholder).\r\n\r\nAfter over a decade of performances, events and releases, Expander is currently regarded as one of the most important key figures in the development of electronic music in Portugal.\r\n \r\nFor more infos on Soniculture please contact info@soniculture.com.\r\nFor bookings please contact: bookings@soniculture.com\r\n",

His discography is rich and all of which have been given strong support by legends such as Danny Tenaglia, Dj Vibe, Pete Tong, Victor Calderone and Dubfire. \r\nContinuing the excellent work with his new music label, In Flagrante Music, the creative genius promises that it will present a fresh and eclectic flavor of electronic productions to music lovers globally. Breaking away from the conventional boundaries of the industry, where music is conveniently pigeon-holed into genres, and sounds are often recycled and reproduced, this new label allows Fauvrelle to produce true and quality dance floor tunes, and will be a reflection of his music during his DJ sets – an epic journey of diverse and interesting musical elements. \r\n\r\nHaving graced consoles and rocked floors at clubs in Portugal and around the world, like Zouk and Velvet in Singapore, Pacha in NYC and Ibiza, Womb in Tokyo, Space in Miami, Rex in Paris and Circus in Montreal, Fauvrelle drops the right beats and allows his DJ sets to combine the marathon-like traditions of the New York’s house music scene with a modern touch and taste of Europe’s current tech-house wave. Marrying old music influences with new ideas, Fauvrelle is a true master of the dance music craft and a name to look out for at present, and in the near future. \r\n\r\nFauvrelle’s latest release on In Flagrante Music « Pre-All Boom » sampler has already created a big  buzz in the industry with the track « Make It Better ». « Make It Better\" was a huge summer weapon for a very limited number of djs... Pete Tong heard it first time when Fauvrelle was warming up for him at his party “Pete Tong – All Gone” @ Pacha Ibiza in August 2012. He not only promoted it heavily in his radio show on BBC 1 for 2 weeks straight but picked it for his compilation released on Defected in November 2012. To quote Pete Tong in his radio show about “Make It Better” \"... I dont´t like to ruin surprises, but that might be the essential new tune next week.\" \r\nAnd because hard work always pays off, Fauvrelle recently signed to Innervisions recordings, with his recently collaboration with Dj Vibe named Nutons.",

Hooked to DJing by watching “DMC championships”, this talented Lithuanian learned scratching before mixing, at the age of 14.\r\nPracticing such technique, led him to hip-hop. Soon became one of the most wanted DJs of this genre in a country and shared stage with artists like Jeru Tha Damaja, Loop Troop, Ugly Duckling, & Dead Prez.\r\nEventually, his comprehensive approach to music and will to improve prevailed. “Electronic beats” became a passion and he was one of the first few diggers of this style in Lithuania.\r\nCuriosity couldn’t keep him within borders. Five months layover in London in 2010, grew a huge interest in raising UK Bass music. However, fascination by warmer cultures brought Emylis to Lisbon by the end of the year, where African & Latin sounds were discovered.",

  "artist_bio": "Check ... 30porumalinha\r\n:)i..ve always had a strong relation with music, my uncle has a huge collection of records from jazz classics to modern jazz to latin , some hip-hop , some Punk, some everything:), so everytime i could i..d go for his records,ehe!! Around 1996 i started to listem to techno music,jeff mills, ritchie hawtin, laurent garnier and also as i live near the border i was a regular listener of Sonia Breeze..s late night dance music program on RN3/Spain wich sometimes had great dj sets, by that time me and my best friend Ricardo started to buy some records and start a ever encreasing record collection. Not being able to fullfill my needs i started a new quest,this time i found myself envolved with more minimal sounds, from there i played across all country and hosted my own radio shows with one hour dedicated to more latin, breaks,soul,jazz sounds and two hours dedicated to techno music. this program reached a lot of persons as it was transmited in saturday night in northeast portugal and interior spain in cooperation with several radio stations. Around 2005 togheter with some friends we began working in a association called 30porumalinha in which we promoted electronic dancefloor oriented events, which lead me to play in some of the best(and worst) clubs and parties around and a summer residence in Triplex Oporto. Living in Barcelona since the end of 2006 and performing in clubs like Becool (SoundWorks/underhits)(SP), Fellini(SP),Moog(SP),Berghain K (Gr),SubClub, Flex (Crazy Sonja night)(AT), Pitch club(PT), ViaClub (CosaNostra/Put Some... PT), UFF!! Festival, Twisted elements Festival(GR),Cassero (IT), Fever (SP)... with artists like Paul Frick, Scott, Frivolous, Guillaume & the Coutu Dumonts, Shonky, dOP, Popnebo, Lars Wickinger, Smacs&Patrick Kong,Deadbeat, A Guy Called Gerald, Zentex..., my dj set is ecletic and for the dancefloor. My obective is for people when they leave the club may do it smiling and happy, djing is like a reward of the music to me and it makes me really happy to be able to show people quality music promoting the ones that do it :) Artists",

  "artist_bio": "DJ / Music Producer based in Lisbon, Portugal.For as long as he can remember, music has always been a part of Gustavo Rodrigues’ life.\r\n\r\nWhen he turned 16, he moved to Brighton where he fell in love with electronic music and the art of deejaying. After, he went to study for a degree in Sound Engineering at the University of Essex.\r\n\r\nAfter 5 years he decided it was time for a change, moving to the warmer climate of São Paulo in Brazil. At 22 he took his first steps as a DJ playing at clubs in Brazilia, Goiana and São Paulo.\r\n\r\nThe new millenium brought with it a renewed desire to explore the world and Gustavo headed for South Africa where he first came into contact with the fascinating world of music production through collaborations with Ans (Protea) and Regan (Pulse). The year 2000 was a highly productive year for Gustavo, as a DJ he played gigs in such places as Rome, London, the Canary Islands and Lisbon.\r\n\r\nIn early 2001 Gustavo decided to return to Portugal for good and fulfil a promise he had made to long-time friend, João Reis aka John-E. The boys joined forces under the name ZOOM. After a few months however, they decided to replace Trance with Progressive House and changed their name to STEREO ADDICTION. Over the years the duo has built up a reputation for their dance floor destroying DJ sets, converted masses of clubbers to their addictive fusion of House, Techno and Electro and cemented their status as one of the most interesting and influential projects in the current Portuguese musical landscape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a production standpoint, Gustavo has experimented with a wide variety of styles and an impressive amount of collaborators. Along with John-E, and under the name Stereo Addiction, the duo has released music on such respected labels as Vapour, Aenaria Tech, New Breed and Kismet. With DJ Aroma, under the name Buggy Freaks, he released “DK/NR” on Berlin based Aromamusic. With Fabrício Medeiros, Gustavo released “Pacote” which broke the Beatport top 100 minimal chart.\r\n\r\nIn a career noteworthy for coherence, Gustavo has had the opportunity to DJ all over the world – Japan, Brazil, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany (at Berlin’s massive Fête de la Musique and Ritterbutzke), the UK (at such clubs as the world renowned fabric, Plastic People, AKA, Cargo, Notting Hill Arts Club and Sketch) and Portugal (Lux, Gare, Indústria [Porto], Pitch, the Sudoeste Festival, Creamfields , Rock In Rio and many, many more).\r\n\r\nHe was the booker and driving force behind Portugal’s most notorious after hours club, Europa, between 2006 and 2009, he is part of the team responsible for the Groovy Beach area at the Boom festival and he is a frequent collaborator with Red Bull, recording their Ginga Beat radio shows.\r\n2010 was a particularly busy year for Gustavo Rodrigues. The lisbon-based DJ and producer spent most of his free time in 2010 making music with a few collaborators, spending countless days (and quite a few long nights) hard at work. The resulting tracks, three of which were done in tandem with Pedro Zoy, Henriq and Twofold, and two remixes for two of Portugal’s most respected genre-bending bands - Blasted Mechanism and :papercutz.\r\nThe wide variety of styles on offer are the result of years of obsessive music consumption. From the groovy house track “Ghetto Prime” (his collaboration with Henriq), to the pounding tech-house of “Ooh Baby” (with Pedro Zoy) and the remix for Blasted Mechanism’s “Under The Sun” (done with his DJ partner John-E) to the hypnotic deep house of “Holy Deep” - done in tandem with techno maverick Twofold .\r\nThe most recent sonic adventure to come out of Gustavo’s studio is a remix for the :papercutz track “Broken Treasure“, a truly epic tune with beautiful swirling synths and massive beats. \r\n\r\n",

From Lisbon to the world, from his residency at the legendary Lisbon's Club W Disco to his first mini World Tour across Europe and Africa, Flip has been on the rise in the underground dance scene.The future of the portuguese talent Flip De Riviera could not get any better. From Flip De Riviera first gig in a students finalist party in 2001 to his 2014 debut World Tour, saw him regularly performing to crowds each time bigger all over the world and 2015 has seen much more smash gigs, touring across Europe and Africa.\r\n\r\nIn December 2004, Flip was invited for his first weekly residency at Roots, a small-club concept known today for his great music taste which he has mainly contributed. Playing all night long groovy underground music, his residency soon became a top destination for clubbers in the area every Wednesday, increasing Flip's notoriety.\r\nHe won the highest Award of the \"Future Superstar DJs\" event, realized in 2006 at Hacienda Klub by the prestigious Portuguese magazine \"Dance Club\".\r\nIn January 2009, he joins the legendary Lisbon's Club named W Disco, for a new residency, once again, every Wednesday. Flip has captured the hearts of underground clubber's in the Portugal's capital, resulting in many other gigs across the entire country as word got around, and gets his first radio show as special guest on Mix FM that year too. Touring extensively in Portugal at much of the best clubs and headlining several underground music festivals, in November 2014 started his first mini World Tour in Africa and Europe.\r\nHis huge love for the marathon sets and crowd intimacy make that he still have today some monthly residencies at several smallest underground clubs, where real fun happens.\r\n\r\nAs producer, Flip De Riviera began learning the ropes of production, drawing on his musical roots to craft his own unique style of House Music. In 2010, he produced 'Make Us Higher' featuring M.Buttterfly released on Kaos Records, which has become a great success on dancefloors, being present in several compilations of Dance Music at the stores, in physical and digital formats, like \"Total Kaos 2010\". In June of 2010, Roger Sanchez chose the Flip De Rivera's Remix of the theme \"Afrodance\" as its preferred remix, which was released on Fatal Music, label of the dutch producer Jaimy. This Remix continues being one of the most ever sold of the label.\r\n2012 sees the birth of the Flip De Riviera's masterpiece featuring Ivo Soares called 'Let It Go' realeased on Exklusive Records (Vidisco), and has been supported by several top artists.\r\nHe has been releasing a steady stream of original tracks and remixes since 2006 and 2015 starts in the better way too, with new originals productions of Tech House, his favorited flavour, which are in a final phase for being release.\r\n\r\nHis ambition and natural talent moves him to the next level, wanting to show to more people his exceptional qualities as a DJ, and as a multifaceted musician.

  "artist_bio": "...constant learning and change, looking for more wisdom and to be able to communicate feelings, thoughts and moments through sound.Around the age of 10 Green Zob's father taught him the basics to mix songs and it was enough to start a long and active connection with music. This was at the bar that he owned when the early 90's were exploding. Green Zob started to refine his musical taste and soon discovered heavy-metal, death-metal and black-metal.\r\n\r\nDuring the mid 90's he let electronic music come in, which opened doors to drum & bass and consequently to other electronic music genres. Goa trance was a big influence in this artist's path (late 90's), which lead him to progressive-psy-trance.In the early 00's Green Zob was djing at some local parties with friends and working at the same time. The money earned was to buy him his first computer, studio monitors and a soundcard which allowed him to finally begin delving into music production.\r\n\r\nAt first Green Zob was seeking to achieve a more progressive-psy-trance sound and after a few years experimenting, he felt the urge to connect this genre with the elements he loved in techno, tech-house and minimal.\r\n\r\nThe result is what we can hear today, music influenced by different styles and past experiences, constant learning and change, looking for more wisdom and to be able to communicate feelings, thoughts and moments through sound.",

Because it is when the sun sets that his creativity can get the most incredulous to start dancing.\r\nHis career started in the early 90´s and it is this passion with electronic music that led him to take control of many dj booths from Europe (Germany , France , Russia, Holland and Spain) to South America (Brazil) and Asia ( Macao, Beijing ,  Thailand , Zhuai).\r\nBut music goes beyond all this. He usually collaborates in several radio shows where he tries to promote new musical trends. Hernandez also produces music for the Chinese television channel Aomen TV. \r\nHis ultimate aim is to make music evolve and that is why he has created in Macau his record label SideFX Records.\r\nThe inspiration and the life path made in all these years come from the experiences and places that left a mark on him. But there are many musicians who also are a reference for Hernandez when he creates like Harvey, Ella Fitzgerald, Radiohead, The Dave Brubeck Quartet  and Sun Ra.\r\n\r\nMusic is A Reason To Celebrate !",

With these playing experiences John-e gained very British electronic roots: playing various musical styles such as break-beat, minimal techno, progressive or deep-house, mixing it all up a bit.\r\nHe moves to Portugal in 2000 continuing his activity as a DJ and beginning his career as a producer. In 2002, already with more consistency, he begins to play live with a laptop, a 16 channels mixer, a synthesizer and FXs as part of the projects ZOOM (dedicated to trance) and, later on, Stereo Addiction (dedicated to house) together with his friend/colleague DJ Gustavo. These projects took them to Kyoto, in Japan, in July 2003, and to a two-day festival in the mountain where they also played as DJs. John-e was also performing at some major events like Underworlds concert in Coliseu de Lisboa, at Da Providers tent in 2004s Optimus Hype @ Meco, with Infusion and Dave Seaman, in Switzerland at Club Spider Galaxy,at Pacha Club with Sander Kleinenberg and finally in Sudoeste Festival 2006 to close the festivals 1st day after Africa Bambatas set.\r\nJohn-e is, nationally, gradually becoming more popular. His style has been developing, transforming itself and getting richer with more and different musical influences. His performance creates energy moments on the dance-floor. His favourite style is funky, deep and hypnotic house, basing it on an excellent musical selection and a perfect technique, always innovating and exploring everything new that can be joined with music. Has been spinning along with names such as: Underworld, Infusion, Nick Warren, Dave Seaman, Sander Kleinenberg, Trentemoller, Kasey Taylor, to name a few.\r\nAfter a fully booked in 2005, John-e is nominee for best newcomer Dj by Dance Club Magazine and Portugal night\r\nReleases :\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "For the last couple of years, Helder Teixeira has been recognised by the industry as having a new and refreshing take on a scene that continues to evolve and seems to have an everlasting shelf life. His identity and musical development can be summed up in a single phrase, “Underground”.  He has created his unique trademark as a DJ and producer around this sound.Helder Teixeira has spent years fine-tuning his music winning formula. \r\n\r\n\"I always had a non-dj approach of djing, in the sense that when playing i am not focussing on making the floor go crazy or focussing on the idea of always keeping the energy level up, up, up! \r\nBut i am very passionate about sharing with the crowd what i think are the dopest records of the moment or the dopest classics.\r\n\r\nIn that sense i’m not pretending to be “right” or “wrong” and i will not make 100% of everybody happy, but i feel that my duty is to inform people of what’s really hot, would it be timeless classics or brand new records.\r\nI’m always trying to present to people a little bit of the history of “my” beloved House and Techno , as i tend to do so by playing very personal “classics” not the Hits from the past but very unique jams that in my mind represent the essence of what is magic in House and Techno.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBorn in 1980, Helder Teixeira sparked interest in music early, starting his career in 1992. Began to be known as Dj Narcotic. His musical style was techno and played at private parties for friends.\r\n\r\nIn 1994 opted for Acid House, playing themes of Phuture, Fast Eddie, DJ Pierre, DJ Camacho and among others. After just over a year, gives himself completely, the whole slope House!\r\n\r\nUntil today, has played in some emblematic portuguese clubs like as: \"Penha Club\", \"Opera-Prima\" (Famalicão), \"Hit\" (Pov. Varzim), \"Tipografia\" (Famalicão), \"Swing\" (Pov. Lanhoso) \"Enseada\" (Pov. Varzim), \"Botequim\" (Braga), \"House Kaffé\" (Braga), \"Astória\" (Braga), \"Barbieri\" (Braga), \"Amo-te Braga\" (Braga), \"Black Jack \"(Vilamoura),\" Romania III (Vilamoura) \",\" Estação da Luz \"(Aveiro) and events such as: The Week In A Paradise Called Portugal - 1996, Enterro da Gata 1998 and Queima das Fitas 2000, Mit Penha and Twins Praia. He shared the booth with names like as: Dj Vibe, Rui Vargas, Jiggy, Luís \"XL\" Garcia, Mario Roque, Tó Ricciardi, and many others.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by artists like: \"Little\" Louie Vega, Francois K, Joe Claussell, DJ Deep, Julien Jabre, Dj Vibe, Danny Krivit, Terry Hunter, Frankie Knuckles, Tito Puente, Mr V, Ron Trent, Kyle Eastwood, among many others! Helder Teixeira thus achieves a fusion of styles, ranging from Deep House, Tech House and Techno.",

Others create their own boxes and carve out their own particular space. João Maria is definitely an example of the latter, in the Portuguese scene.\r\n\r\nAlready 15 years in the game, as a DJ, label founder and record store owner, João Maria made his name a respected one, by setting an example through leading instead of just following, trusting his musical vision and cherishing his independence. The results speak for themselves and prove him right. Besides being a regular fixture in Portuguese clubs like Gare Porto and Ministerium (where he has a residence) and festivals like Super Bock Super Rock, Neo Pop and, more recently, FORTE Festival, he´s become a frequent flyer to Berlin, by landing regular gigs at the highly regarded Salon Wilde Renate (including a guest spot at a Hello?Repeat event) and playing at one of the hallmarks of the Berlin club scene, Katerholzig, right before it´s closing in 2013.\r\n\r\nThe culmination of this steady ascent comes now in the form of a guest spot in one of the tINI and The Gang parties in Ibiza in the summer of 2014 and an Assemble Music showcase invitation from the Toi Toi crew in London last year.\r\n\r\nNot happy with just playing his challenging blend of refined techno and house, he helps bring it out to the music addicts, with his two babies, the Carpet and Snares record store (and its twin, the new Carpet Music agency), in partnership with Zé Salvador and Jorge Caiado, and the aforementioned vinyl-only Assemble Music label, where such minimal techno pioneers as Ricardo Villalobos, Baby Ford and Wolfgang Voight (as Studio 1) have had releases, along with current movers like Daze Maxim, Dorian Paic, Vera, Voigtmann and more. You don´t make lasting and steady connections like these by accident. João Maria does it by setting the bar and then living up to the expectations.\r\n\r\nText by Nuno Mendonça.",

There, his musical taste began to be framed and soon realized that music was part of himself.Known for having a style a little risky and different than usual, since normally bet in different sounds on his sets, the DJ with an eclectic musical line quite versatile and not restricted to a unique musical style in making their sessions authentic boxes filled with great groove surprises ! The versatility of the sets depends on the spirit and the environment created by tapping into the public, not just for himself and thereby transforming their sets in authentic \"Chameleons\".",

  "artist_bio": "Jorge Caiado (Balance / Groovement / Carpet & Snares):\r\n\r\nThis dedicated house music lover might have been taught the know-how in audio signal paths and production to become a licensed sound engineer. But it's in the clubs that he's learnt how to connect with the dancers. Absorbing a range of influences from bouncy Brazilian basslines to the various homesteads of American deep house, Jorge has been developing his own take on electronic dance music. \r\n\r\nAt only 25, he's already been DJing for eight years and currently working as a label manager assistant in Portuguese Groovement imprint. With forthcoming releases on Chicago's Balance Recordings, Jorge is looking to cement that style with some moves of his own.BIOGRAPHY:\r\n\r\nIt really is true what they say about age not being equal to status. At 25 years of age and with his 1st record coming out as recently as 2012, you listen to a Jorge Caiado production or DJ set and get the distinct feeling that you´re in the presence of a tried and tested veteran of the scene.\r\n\r\nThis impression isn´t a result of beginner´s luck. Caiado carries with him the musical and technical  baggage of a heavyweight and propels it with the emotion and enthusiasm for his craft of someone who falls in love with music everyday as if it was the 1st time.\r\n\r\nHis background comes from a degree in Sound Engineering and as a student in the prestigious Red Bull Music Academy (Madrid, 2011), one of a few portuguese to achieve that distinction. The rest comes from something which either you have or you don´t : natural talent and insatiable curiosity about the music. At least, it seemed enough for house music legend Chez Damier to take him under his wing and tutorship, giving him his 1st release, “Beyond The Atlantic”, on his influential Balance label (with a further 2nd release to come in 2014).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdd to that remix duties for Giles Smith on Giles´ Secretsundaze label, Terrence Parker and Orlando Voorn, and you´ve got an impressive production pedigree, which is matched with his history in the DJ booth: regular gigs in the most important clubs and festivals in Portugal (Lux, Gare Porto, Ministerium, Optimus Alive, Neo-Pop) cemented Caiado´s standing as one of the country´s top DJs in the 9 years he´s been spinning.\r\n\r\nHis focus and drive sees him still finding time to be the label manager and executive producer for the portuguese Groovement label and also with João Maria and Zé Salvador weave the tapestry of the Carpet and Snares record store and Carpet Music agency. Moved by the same passion whether he´s in the studio, in the booth or simply talking to you about music, the student is becoming the teacher. Let Jorge Caiado take you to school.",

He started learning everything about electronic dance music, raves and hot nights out in clubs and at parties, like Automatik nights at Rex Club in Paris, Locomia in Albufeira Algarve, L’ Anfer in Dijon France, Rocks Club at Porto or DJs such as Laurent Garnier, Vitalic and, for sure, his cousin Dj Tonio. Joel made his way into the electronic music listening to records from labels like Axis, Code Red, Sinewave or Tresor Berlin. At 18 his cousin offer him a Roland MC 303 and he started producing his own tracks. After 8 years producing, sound editing and working as a roadie, Joel made his first steps into mixing at friends parties and then at hometown bars and clubs. Nowadays and as a DJ, Joel Campos does not hesitate to combine Minimal House and Electro Tech, light and hard grooves with hot, futuristic club sounds. Joel’s DJ sets are characterized by his knowledge of French Touch and dance music of the European club scene. Only one year was enough for Joel to be invited to some of the best Portuguese Clubs like Maré Alta at Porto or Via Latina at Coimbra. Joel’s DJ sets are sophisticated, subtle and becoming more and more expressive....\r\n\r\n\r\n(Portuguese version)\r\n\r\nJoel Campos aka Hi_Duplx iniciou-se no mundo da música de dança electrónica, aos dezassete anos, pela mão do seu primo DJ Tonio da mítica editora FCommunication (França). Este interesse levou-o até Paris e a frequentar alguns dos melhores Clubes, Discotecas e Festas da época, como as noites techno Automatik no Rex Club em Paris ou as noites Wake UP no L’ Anfer em Dijon. Em 1998, Joel conheceu pessoalmente aqueles que seriam seus mestres e mentores Laurent Garnier, Vitalic e seu primo Dj Tonio. Joel continuou a sua busca por sons electrónicos alternativos recorrendo ao som de editoras como a Axis, Code Red, Sinewave ou Tresor Berlin. Durante oito anos, Joel explorou o mundo da música, quer como roadie, quer como produtor musical, fazendo uso da excelente Groove box, a Roland MC 303, que utilizou nos seus primeiros passos como produtor. O apelo dos seus amigos e a atracção pela “dance music” levou-o a tentar lidar com as pistas de dança, agora sim, como deejay. Joel Campos não hesitou em misturar Minimal House e Electro Tech, ritmos quentes e pesados com o som da Club Scene actual. \r\nOs DJ sets de Joel Campos são caracterizados e inspirados no seu vasto conhecimentos da French Touch e da música de dança da Club Scene europeia. Os seus sets sofisticados e extremamente expressivos levaram-no em pouco tempo à cabine de som de alguns dos bons clubes nacionais como o Maré Alta no Porto,NB Club (Viseu) Via Latina (Coimbra), Sasha (Portimão) e fora de portas Rex Club (Paris), Rote Sonne em Munique, Faculdade de Belas Artes (Vigo).",

He has shared stage with some of the most famous of his international peers, but also managed to build a strong relationship of trust with the city’s best venues and most demanding crowds. The sounds that he loves and shares with these crowds come from all horizons of the musical world, even though his knowledge is firmly rooted in House music.\r\nBut although he has been known to effortlessly bring parties to unexpected territories, João’s sets never rely solely on eclecticism or any other easy trick. His most important quality as a DJmore subtle kind: humility. The humility of someone who aims to craft a memorable musical experience in tight collaboration with the party-goers. Because great collaborations always require a generous amount of both humility and talent.",

  "artist_bio": "Hugo Villanova (born as Hugo Ricardo Pinto, 15 March 1983)is a Portuguese DJ and Producer. Currently resides in Lisbon, Portugal.In recent explosion of talent and DJs that the music industry has seen in recent years, there are very few that can show a solid and extensive career. Hugo Villanova has cultivated throughout his career several successes. Furthermore, there are few DJs who can actually attest the kind of dedication to quality, something that Hugo Villanova has defended stoutly. \r\nMore than an artist, he has been a leader, an experienced producer with his own style. \r\nHugo Villanova has defended over its own unique breed of electronic music more than any other, not following fads or trends but what he has in his soul, and this has made ​u8203 him see his music being played countless times by DJs radios and even television. \r\nWith a discography that currently has more than 30 original singles published in numerous national and international record labels, worked with some of the best national artists, getting to be in every radio nationally. With Diego Miranda signed the hit 'JUST FLY' that quickly reached the tops of the most heard songs in Portugal and the year after, \"Only with the Sunshine\" with the vocals of David Cruz. \r\nHis history began in the 90s when techno music was at its peak in Portugal. Inspired by artists like Laurent Garnier, Plastikmen, Robert Miles and others led to what he himself saw them as pioneers in something that virtually no one do at the time in Portugal, the electronic music. The taste for production, comes from kid, starting to build the first sounds with little existing machines and the software at the time, with only 15 years. Some years passed, acquiring a wide experience in terms of production and studio but his love for music became a passion for performance. Met a few years later, Dj's of great national name, which gave him the courage to, acted live and to show the world the knowledge he has about everything that concerns the Djing / Production. Your DJ SET's are the result of its ability to externalize and share feelings creating a synergy with those who attend their performances. Already was resident DJ at some of the best clubs nationwide, including the mythical nightclub Kadoc Algarve. Known for his love of music, his dedication to his fans, and his commitment to always offer quality, he built a reputation of class and good charisma that is often lacking in the modern music scene, and proved one of the few artists is proudly true to his principles. \r\nIt is fair to say that Hugo Villanova remains one of the most active artists and producers in the dance scene today. Uncompromising and driven by a relentless passion to offer the best for those who enjoy it, Hugo continues to be one of the forces that define the dance music for many years to come.\r\n\r\nDIFF RECORDS\r\n@diffrecords\r\nwww.facebook.com/diffrecords\r\n--\r\nHUGO VILLANOVA\r\nwww.hugovillanova.com\r\nfacebook.com/hugovillanovaofficial\r\nmyspace.com/hugovillanova\r\ntwitter.com/hugovillanova\r\nyoutube.com/user/hugovillanova\r\n--",

If Lewis Fautzi´s sound could be materialized, it would look something like this.\r\n\r\nAnd you draw a similar parallel to hi..The gleam of cosmic light reflects on polished surfaces, which sometimes trace long smooth curves, other times end in edges, outlining a powerful machine piercing a path between the gravitational pull of a black hole, and the attraction of the brightness of a newly-born  star. If Lewis Fautzi´s sound could be materialized, it would look something like this.\r\n\r\nAnd you draw a similar parallel to his career so far. Lewis Fautzi has a meteoric ascension in the world techno scene, like a projectile fired into space at the speed of light: in 2013, the same year as his 1st noteworthy edition in his birth country, Portugal (and from the start establishing the norm of always releasing on well-respected labels, Soniculture in this case), Fautzi started a lineage of releases on a classic label in techno´s history, Slam´s Some Quality. A year later, in 2014, it was time for his 1st album, an artistic step many in techno fear to take, “The Gare Album” (named after the club in Porto which has served as his creative impulse and launch platform for his career), on Soma as well.\r\n\r\nBy 2015, Lewis has in his log, 2 EP´s on Len Faki´s Figure, 2 works on Oscar Mulero´s Pole Group (an EP of originals remixed by Exium and Kwartz and a track on the Unknown Landscapes Vol.2 comp), with an added one on Warm-Up (Mulero taking care of 2 remixes), a collab with Pär Grindvik on his “baby” Faut Section, the same label where we get an Oscar Mulero EP with 2 Lewis Fautzi remixes. Crucially, he put out a 2nd album on Soma, “Space Exploration”, a conceptual work, as personal as it feels alien, where he displays his unsatiable thirst for musical knowledge and exploration, by broadening his horizons towards more ambient and experimental sound forms. He´s also provided interstellar tourism experiences, both as a DJ or as a live-act, at dancefloors like Tresor, Gare Porto, Lux Frágil and the “final frontier”, Berghain, amongst many other notable spaces.\r\n\r\nAll these facts almost lead us to forget that Luís Gonçalves (his actual name), from the small town of Barcelos, is still in his early twenties. It makes you ask “where did all this world of music come from?”. Most likely it´s due to Luís breathing, living, techno. Not just producing it himself but also studying and absorbing the form in all it´s perspectives, taking hold of an arsenal of ideas and notions synthesized into a sound that while adhering to the fundamentals, ends up as very much his own, appealing to technoheads of various outlooks. Yes, there´s the Mills-ian cosmic tones, the subterranean echoes of Berlin, the impact of the british industrialists and the peculiar groove of the Spanish scene, but it all has a definitive  Lewis Fautzi  stamp.\r\n\r\nNo matter how many years a techno producer has been at it, he knows he´s doing something very right when, still early in his career, the “alien” Jeff Mills plays multiple productions of his in a single set. It´s the definitive seal of approval for what you are creating. But doesn´t seem at all fazed by the responsibility. The growing amplitude of his vision and maturity of his output, and the recognition of his peers, prove that. Lewis Fautzi´s explorations have just begun. Where will he take us next?\r\n\r\n\r\nWords: Nuno Mendonça",

Like a good idea that revitalizes, Lamp shall do it through Techno.\r\nThey say that when you eat pepper, your body creates immunity to it. I belive that the same happens with music, good taste and the education of the ear. Time is determinant and makes our decision and taste more accurate. I passed through many genres and an early introduction to nighlife made electronic music my centre. From tribal, to house, to progressive and minimal; from Danny Tenaglia to Richie Hawtin. Many years and music after, I reached Techno and feel as if it is the right place.\r\n",

Igor does not identify with only one type of music, instead he's more interested in rhythm and melody as abstract universal musical entities, exploring harmony and tension not only in his own tracks but also in his sophisticated musical choice...",

Always with a walkman in his jacket, tip toeing his way around the city so his CDs won't scratch. \r\n\r\nWhile time passed he started experimenting with other styles and sub-genres where he first met techno. At 15 he got himself his first fake I'd and didn't wait any longer to use it. Later that night he went to his first real party at Pacha NYC to see the legend himself Jonathan Peters!\r\n\r\nIt was from there on out he started building his collection. From digital to vinyl, even cassette tapes he found from Exit before his time. \r\n\r\nHe then pursued further knowledge by attentending Dubspot NYC on w14th St finishing with a degree in audio engineering.\r\n\r\nEvolving was a major step, with idles such as Ricardo Villalobos, Danny Tengalia, Dewalta & many more. In search for a distinct sound to base his music on, gig after gig he accomplished major progress showcasing his tunes at Pacha, Governors Island, Bliss & many social gatherings it is safe to say techno minimalist 'festajeiro' is a strong force to be reckoned with.",

We just had to write KaSpar to make the page work...\r\nKa§par began his dj career at 15, in 1998, and has released music since he was 18. He is the co-founder of Groovement recordings and one the newer generation, avant-guard producers to be signed to Clone records, with great releases on 4lux, Stripped & Chewed, Rawax (Housewax), and many other respected labels. He is one Portugal's most sought after dj's and an experienced studio engineer.(Please look for \"Ka§par\" in Resident Advisor, as it does not allow the \"§\" character)\r\n\r\nBorn in 1982, Ka§par started his working life in 1998, at the age of 15, as a dj in strip joint in his home town - a degraded suburb in the outskirts of Lisbon. He went on to become the resident DJ at Portugal's eldest club \"Frágil\", the next year, a legendary spot where music is of the upmost importance and where he still plays two gigs a month to this day. In 1999 he released his first tracks, and went on to work with every major musical artist in Lisbon. In the early 2000's he became a regular guest dj at Lux-Frágil, possibly on of Europe's finest clubs.\r\n\r\nIn 2003 he started to put out his music on his own Groovement recordings, which he started with best friends Rui Torrinha and António \"Jackzen\" Alves. He then went on to sign for bigger and well-respected labels: Gerd's 4Lux and Serge's Clone, in Holland, Rawax in Berlin, Midnight Shift in Singapore... Similar minded people who appreciated his uncompromising style and futuristic blends in house and boogie under a high tech setting, that incorporates elements of funk, dub, jazz or hip hop.\r\n\r\nHe currently curates and co manages Tink! Records in Amsterdam and Blossom Kollektiv in Berlin, as a communications director and content developer in either platform, as well as recording artist.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlso search discogs for Ka§par and Kaspar (this is the first Kaspar)",

With nearly 10 years of experience behind the turntables playing in some of the areas premier nightspots, Marcio Brito has developed a faithful following. \r\n\r\n\r\nSeemingly a natural since his early teens, Marcio began spinning for friends at private parties, and was soon filling in for a DJ at a local club. His signature Tech-House style mixed with energetic vocals has since become an unmistakable sound that has been heard in venues from Sakura to SeOne Clube. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs a DJ, no one can question Marcio's versatility; whether he’s creating a night woven with dark and mysterious beats, or charging up the dance floor with electrifying vocals backed with hard grooves, Marcio intuitively works a room with his creative mixing and programming style, playing music for the masses, as well as the most discriminating audiences \r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to becoming a DJ, his younger years were still filled with music, starting with Bass Guitar at 10 and continuing all through his teenage years. Growing up opened him up to appreciating for all types of music, from classical to dance. Once he was exposed to the club and rave scenes, he couldn't get enough of the beats. He was hooked immediately to the vibe, the crowd, the atmosphere, the enjoyment. \r\n\r\n\r\nMusic enables Marcio's soul to speak. You feel him when you hear him and you immediately understand the passion, love and respect he has for music. He's an old soul, even though his age doesn't say that. His focus is always on the feeling and the realness of the music and its message. \r\nMarcio Brito has played alongside greats such as Felix da Housecat\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of it all, however, it is only one thing that audiences truly sense when they hear Marcio Brito spin. It’s the one thing that keeps his crowds coming back to him for more. It’s the force that keeps Marcio Brito constantly moving forward in a world immersed in stillness. That thing is: the power of music.\r\n",

  "cover_photo": "",
  "artist_bio": "Julio Carvalho is a young man born on June 7, 1990, lives in the city of Trofa, where you first went to a cabin. This young man saw very early electronic music as an integral part in his life since 14 years with just the pet for this musical style began to become unmanageable.Since then the hours spent with cd decks and the mixer started to occupy much of the time in your day to day. 2 Years refuge in the home or the home of some friends in order to obtain a good learning. After these two years of hard work and dedication here comes their first appearance in public and there was only 16 years, Etc Bar in his hometown. The opinion was unanimous among the public, there was someone different, someone who lived every beat of the music that was playing and it made be noted that even though only his first set in public. Your House joyful and contagious, always with lively vocals and hard hitting and full of joy even then danced even the most timid. She then began playing with some frequency for the audience of his city, and has even signed by the resident Etc Bar During the year 2006 was resident in that bar renowned in the north, one year after the invitations go to the booths other homes in the north of the country were many proposals to play alongside big names appeared regularly in national Djing. It was time to take another step in his career, but never leaving the house she saw him born. During 2007 he played in several clubs, bars and Events in the north, but the dream to the nightmare was only one step. After a year 2007 full of music and joy here comes the year 2008, the year in which he was obliged for reasons beyond the music to pause a little long in their performances before the public. But not so the total removal of the song was, whenever I had a free minute he was there from the decks and mixer. After two years at the request of many friends and some of the audience that he was born for the dance floor return was inevitable. After all this time he still came back with more quality and joy than ever, its great comeback happened in the cabin of Pedra Do Couto nightclub, with a set full of remarkable and animation. Since there never stopped. Today is for many of the great promises of a new generation of Dj's nationals. Even in the case of a youth of 20 years already has performances in clubs, bars and events for big name nationally, such as: EtcLounge Bar, Pedra Do Couto, Berber Club, Bar Unik, Ba-bu, In Guide , Independent Caffe On The Sound, Girls Caffe, Adversus Bar, Café Passage, see 20, Reception at VNF freshman, fifth Goodbyesummer @ the beach in Youth Festival-Trofa among others. I have also shared the booth with names like Mindskap, Steven, Nuno Di Rosso, Andre Alves, Richard Jay, Kika Lewis, Peter Heart Beatz, Dj dxt, B Alexander, Overule, Pedro Freitas, Mariana Couto, Filipa Baptista (Voice of mega hit My First Luv Cazanova with Peter), Maria Sampaio and others. That Young has now played more often again, and the invitations have not stopped emerging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJúlio Carvalho é um jovem nascido a 7 de Junho de 1990, vive na cidade da Trofa, local onde subiu pela primeira vez a uma cabine. Este jovem desde muito cedo viu a música Electrónica como parte integrante na sua vida, já que com apenas 14 anos o bichinho por esse estilo musical começou a tornar-se incontrolável. Desde ai as horas passadas com os decks de cd e a mesa de mistura passaram a ocupar grande parte do tempo no seu dia-a-dia. 2 Anos refugiado na sua casa ou na casa de alguns amigos com o intuito de obter uma boa aprendizagem. Passados esses 2 anos de muito trabalho e dedicação eis que surge a sua primeira aparição em publico e ai com apenas 16 anos, no Etc Bar, na sua cidade natal. A opinião entre o publico era unânime, estava ali alguém diferente, alguém que vivia cada Beat da musica que tocava e isso fazia-se notar mesmo sendo esse apenas o seu primeiro set em publico. O seu House alegre e contagiante, sempre com vocais animados e com batidas fortes e cheias de alegria já nessa altura fazia dançar até mesmo os mais tímidos. A partir dai começou a tocar com alguma frequência para o publico da sua cidade, tendo mesmo assinado residência pelo Etc Bar. Durante o ano de 2006 foi residente nesse mesmo bar de renome na zona norte, um ano depois os convites para subir as cabines de outras casas no norte do pais eram muitos, as propostas para tocar ao lado de grandes nomes do Djing nacional surgiam regularmente. Estava na hora de dar mais um passo na sua carreira, mas nunca abandonando a casa que o vira nascer. Durante o ano de 2007 tocou em vários Clubs, Bares e Eventos na zona norte, mas do sonho ao pesadelo foi apenas um passo. Depois de um ano de 2007 cheio de música e alegria eis que chega o ano de 2008, ano no qual foi obrigado por motivos alheios a música a fazer uma pausa um pouco prolongada nas suas actuações perante o publico. Mas nem assim o afastamento da música foi total, sempre que tinha uns minutos livres lá estava ele junto dos decks e da mesa de mistura. Passados 2 anos e a pedido de muitos amigos e algum do publico que o viu nascer para as pistas de dança o regresso tornou-se inevitável. Após todo esse tempo parado ele voltou com mais qualidade e alegria que nunca, a sua grande reaparição aconteceu na cabine da discoteca Pedra Do Couto, com um set notável e cheio de animação. Desde ai nunca mais parou. Hoje em dia é para muitos uma das grandes promessas da nova geração de Dj's nacionais. Mesmo tratando-se de um jovem de apenas 20 anos já conta com actuações em Club, Bares e Eventos de grande nome a nível nacional, tais como: EtcLounge Bar, Pedra Do Couto, Club Berber, Bar Uniko, Ba-bu, In Guia, Independente Caffe, Por Do Som, Girls Caffe, Adversus Bar, Café da Passagem, 20 ver, Recepção ao caloiro V.N.F, Goodbyesummer@quinta da praia, Juventude em Festa-Trofa entre outros. Também já partilhou a cabine com nomes como: Mindskap, Steven, Nuno Di Rosso, André Alves, Richard Jay, Kika Lewis, Pedro Coração, Beatz, Dxt Dj, B Alexander, Overule, Pedro Freitas, Mariana Couto, Filipa Baptista(Voz do mega hit My First Luv com Pedro Cazanova), Maria Sampaio entre outros. Este Jovem tem tocado agora com maior frequência novamente, e os convites não tem parado de surgir.",

With releases on beloved imprints such as Love Not Money, Society 3.0, Endemic Digital, Aenaria, Plastik Galaxy, among many others.\r\nMeko is a promising figure in Portugal ́s dance scene.2013 revealed itself as year of affirmation with a mixed compilation and releases on acclaimed labels worldwide.  Underground music culture has become a part of his DNA and no matter how much the 'real world' tells him to do something mainstream, it just doesn't resonate.Meko ́s music style is a consequence of many years of hard work and experience in handling dance floors. His criteria is high both in his production and Dj sets, he believes in quality over quantity and he ́s slowly but surely on his way to becoming a talent to be reckoned with.This is the way how he would like to spread his sound out into the world. His impulse to get more and more better and to develop himself will give his audience a lot of musically surprises in the future.",

Still to come out a new remix by PACHA RECORDINGS.\r\n\r\nThis was also the year he launched his own label, along with former colleague Mikie Wilde: The Souled Records has revealed high quality with the release of the EP's \"Here We Are\" and \"cocktail\". Matoz Miguel is currently a resident Club of Trumps, which is still more to make a difference in the Lisbon night and internationally.\r\n  \r\n",

Começou por tocar em festas para amigos e na escola onde tinha o seu programa de rádio. Tem a sua primeira actuação num bar frequentado pelos estudantes em Lamego, foi aí que teve o primeiro contacto com o público e onde as suas sonoridades mais tribais, se soltaram envolvendo o \"party people\" numa onda House predominante na altura. Mais tarde foi convidado para tocar no bar mais em voga do momento em Lamego, Zona J, no final da primeira actuação foi convidado a ter uma residência onde permaneceu até ao seu fecho. Aí adquiriu e estabeleceu conhecimentos na área do djing, que proporcionaram o grande salto na sua carreira como dj.\r\n\r\n          O grande \"boom\" ocorre com a maior festa realizada na região em 2008, \"Lamego Summer Festival\". Mistiktribe foi convidado para ser o dj oficial tocando na abertura e no fecho da edição de 2008. Aí, sem dúvida que foi um dos auges da sua carreira, onde teve o privilégio de tocar com XL Garcia e o grande dj/produtor, Mastiksoul.\r\n \r\n           Desde então manteve uma residência semanal no melhor bar dançante da cidade de Lamego, Cooperativa de Consumo, que se estendeu desde Outubro de 2009 até ao seu fecho em 2011. Nesse mesmo ano, representou Portugal continental, em 2011, na final do concurso DJ's AZ nos Açores. \r\n           \r\n            Actualmente tem vindo a tocar em algumas festas onde já dividiu a cabine com alguns dos melhores djs de renome nacional tais como Carlos Fauvrelle, Nuno Clam, Carlos Manaça, Diego Miranda, Miguel Rendeiro, Kika Lewis, entre outros.",

Owning a huge musical background that truly inspires his performances without forgetting the most recent trends in the House Music field, Miguel feels that his inspirations derives from a crossover of diferent sorts of music within the electronic scene: from the synth pop, disco and funk music from the eighties to the more electronic new trends, his sets are always a strong show case of his music collection, accounting for more than 4,000 vinyl records and growing each day as he still considers himself an activist. Former Resident of some of the most outstanding Clubs in the north of Portugal and a frequent Dj in many of the House Festivals organized in the country, Miguel..s skills are amazing, reflecting a degree of experience rarely achieved in the dance scene, allowing him to manage a dance floor in a consistent and yet flexible form. Miguel Amaro is -without any doubt - one of the most respected and experienced Dj.s in the Portuguese House Music Scene \r\n\r\nContando com mais de 25 anos de carreira, Miguel Amaro é actualmente um dos Djs mais antigos da cidade do Porto no activo. Possuidor de um background musical enorme que marca a sua sensibilidade de maneira profunda, as suas actuações são marcadas pela actualidade dos sons que toca e o feeling de quem já foi influenciado por diversas correntes musicais ao longo de mais de duas décadas. Desde o Disco ao Synth Pop e Funk dos anos 80 até á musica electronica actual, a sua discografia é vasta. Possuidor de mais de 4,000 discos em formato vinyl, Miguel Amaro continua a ser um coleccionador ávido do formato. Ex residente de algumas das casas de mais prestígio da cidade do Porto e presença frequente em muitos dos mais importantes festivais de House Music que ocorreram no nosso país, Miguel Amaro é possuidor de uma técnica extraordináriamente consistente e de uma versatilidade desenvolvida ao longo de inúmeras noites a gerir pistas de dança. Seguramente um dos valores mais proeminentes dentro do panorama dos DJ.s nacionais",

He is influenced by the acid house and underground groove, so typical of the mythical club, Rock's (Portugal), where he started to know and to get familiarized with dance music. After playing in some of the best venues in in Portugal and traveling throughout Europe with his music, Drew's plan is to keep on playing as much as possible, as that is his main passion, and to keep focused in his production career so... we may expect some news soon...His interest for music started to develop in a early age so he began to gather electronic music like a maniac since then, building a musical knowledge which allows him to alternate between various styles, mainly Tech House and even some Deep and Funky stuff. He didn´t take too long to embrace an international adventure as he joined the \"Empathy UK\" roster, which took his name abroad, having the opportunity to play alongside some of the top names on the scene, building a loyal audience and fans, gaining very good reputation and feedback in places like Poland, England, Croatia, Austria, Czech Republic, Lituânia, Spain and Greece. \r\nIn 2012 he made his debut as a producer and, since then, he has been developing his discography, increasingly delivering good quality music. \r\n2015 is looking promising as he as scheduled four new releases in major labels, as well as some other new projects in progress.

She travels from Nu-disco, deephouse, soulful, deep-tech, tech-house, techno and electronica, always keeping it filled with vocals, and with a characteristic Groove and a melodic, sexy vibe.\r\nIt was with this wide range musical style and great female intuition to control any dance floor that Blondie started to see her work getting recognition from the best Djs and Portuguese clubs to the worldwide clubbing scene, and even at the biggest festivals such as Rock in Rio, MTV Shakedown, Smirnoff Experience and Sunrise festival, playing for over 100,000 people.\r\nYou can check her out not only in Portugal, but also across the world, she as already performed in some of the best clubs in the 4 continents , Europe, America, Asia and Africa! This confessed workaholic dj, dancer and music lover finally took it to the next level, releasing her first EP with Dj Diego Miranda - \" Black Diamond\" for New Breed Records, her first remix : Pedro Saraiva feat Daniela Galbin “Hollywood” for Pandora Records and Kaos Records and her first original track –Groovin’ - by Asymmetric Recordings, remixed by the one and only Audiojunkies!... And is currently collaborating in some other projects with Jackspot and a few other producers.\r\nHer true love for music and wide range versatility is shown in her experience in djing parallel areas such as writing her own monthly column for the biggest Portuguese dance scene magazine – DanceClub - interviewing some of the biggest names in production; producing and hosting 2 different TV shows : Conversas de Estúdio, and Backstage Blondie; and more recently, managing and teaching at ProDJ – DJ and Electronic Music Production Academy in Oporto.\r\nMiss Blondie, definitely a name to remember!",

During that time he played at the Venues: Sosho Match (Bar/Club, 2 Tabernacle Street, Broadgate, Old Street, London), Bang Bar (Ivory House, St. Katharine Docks, London), and every Sunday Sessions at Lloyds No. 1 (Camden, The Ice Wharf, 28 Jamestown Road, London).In his ceaseless quest for perfection and artistic growth, he felt the need to extend his art to music creation, and finally he assumed the role of producer.His music sits perfectly along the boundries of deep, hypnotic tech house grooves and percussion infused techno beats, appealing to both underground house and techno lovers alike…\r\n Labels : Bembe Recordings, Cristal Music, DPM Records, Ecletic Beats, Glam Records, Plastik Galaxy Records, Sandy Records\r\n\r\nhttp://djphew.webs.com/\r\nhttp://www.beatport.com/artist/dj-phew/243795\r\nhttp://www.junodownload.com/artists/DJ+Phew/releases/\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Dj-Phew/148057028126\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/djphew\r\nhttp://www.myspace.com/djphew\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/djphew\r\nhttp://www.soundcloud.com/djphew",

  "artist_bio": "Paul Ricard is acknowledged as one of the most genuine artists in the Portuguese DJ scene. Since the final of the 80's he had gone a long way to earn the respect of other DJs, Club Promoters, and Party People.Back in 1988 he started his record colection. It is true that with only eight years old he was frenetic about buying new music. \r\nThe first step into DJing was recording compilation tapes, then came the mixing, beat matching, sound monitoring and he made his first public appearance in a local Radio Station back in 1992. By then he managed to learn everything there is to know about DJ Equipment.\r\nOn that Radio Station, he Hosted along with Marcus a Dance Music Radioshow called \"Hora Cinderela\" \"(Cinderella Hour)\", and got his first feedback from the audience by the name of DJ Oxygen.\r\n   \r\nIn 1995 and after several student parties at the local Club, he get's the invitation to become it's Resident DJ, making it impossible to keep up with the Radio show all produced live.\r\nThe Residency at \"SAI DE GATAS\" was really the experience to being a full time job DJ, and he made that decision a little bit too early in life, as the liberty of moving around was being restricted by worried parents that couldn't see it as a Future career.\r\nNonetheless, and still underage he went on an adventure in another city, only hanging on his DJ outcome.\r\nBy that time he had already played in all the Venues back home, and in this new city things were working out just the same way. It was in 1998 when the name \"Paul Rodhy\" came up, and was simply the way that an American read his name in a flyer.\r\nIn 2000 he moves to Lisbon, and started his residency at \"Kasino\" and by 2004 he managed to play in almost every prestigious Club in the Lisbon Wide area.\r\n2005 starts out to be a year of great exposure, as he became officially Sponsored by Pioneer, and was hosting a radioshow on Mix Fm's prime time called \"Underground Sound From Lisbon\".\r\n\r\nIn the present day he his hosting the \"V for Vinyl\" parties, and hosting the Underground Sound  From Lisbon cast on his personal Mixcloud.\r\n\r\n",

Em 2002 arrisca pela primeira vez a função de DJ e descobriu nela a sua vocação. Mas só a partir de 2005 que começa a investir nela seriamente depois de ter actuado em três edições do “Let's Dance!”, afters organizados pela Elements, e de consequentemente, ter sido convidado a integrar o rooster desta agência, onde regressou, este ano de 2011, depois de 4 anos a trabalhar com a Extra DJ Agency.\r\n\r\nActualmente é um dos mais versáteis e requisitados dj's da cidade de Coimbra. Desempenhou o papel de DJ residente até Agosto de 2011 no Theatrix, tendo já, anteriormente, desempenhado esse papel no extinto Delight, no Vox Poppuli e no Duplex, também em Coimbra, e no Blitz (Ançã). A actividade de residente foi fundamental no seu crescimento como DJ e na sua compreensão do dancefloor e do party people.\r\n\r\nNo seu curriculo encontram-se passagens mais ou menos frequentes por várias casas de renome como Via Latina, Scotch, Vinyl, Wide, El Divino (todas em Coimbra), Bergantim, Gloss, Pessidónio, Zeitgeist (todas na Figueira da Foz), Clube Suite, Soho (Leiria), Kimika (Castelo Branco), Zoo (Porto), entre outras onde partilhou alinhamentos com alguns DJ's de renome nacional e internacional, entre os quais destaca Vibe, Miguel Rendeiro, Jiggy, Gustavo Ribeiro, Serginho, Bobby D'Ambrosio, Kourosh, Rui Vargas, Laura Jones, King Bizz, Rui Murka, Magazino, Mário Roque ou Jepe. \r\n\r\nMantém residências periódicas no Lottus After Hours (Porto); no Club da Praça (Mirandela) e no Ópera Prima (Marinha Grande).\r\n\r\nSendo um pessoa com gostos ecléticos e diversificados a sua actividade como DJ reflecte, também ela, esse ecletismo. Porque na música os rótulos servem apenas para organização mental e não para a criação de preconceitos, não fecha as portas a nenhum tipo de sonoridade no âmbito da house music, sendo habitual nos seus sets mais longos ouvir coisas que vão desde o soulful ao tech house, às vezes mesmo com umas piscadelas de olho ao techno.\r\n\r\nEN\r\nMyro has been a constant presence on Coimbra’s night scene, having actually collaborated with a wide range of places in the city, in several functions. In 2002 he risks the first appearance as a DJ and discovers his vocation. But it will be only from 2005 that he starts working seriously on it, after playing in three editions of “Let’s Dance”, a series of after parties organized by Elements, and consequently being invited to integrate the agency’s rooster, to where he has returned now, in 2011, after 4 years working with the Extra DJ Agency.\r\n\r\nHe is currently one of the most versatile and required DJs of Coimbra. Until August 2011, he was resident at Theatrix, and before that he was also resident at the former Delight, at the Vox Poppuli and at Duplex, also in Coimbra, and at the Blitz, in Ançã, a location near the city. His activity of resident DJ was essential in his growth as a professional and in his understanding of the dancefloor and party people.\r\n\r\nIn his curriculum one can find fairly frequent appearances at well known places such as Via Latina, Scotch, Vinyl, Wide, El Divino (all in Coimbra), Bergantim, Gloss, Pessidónio (in Figueira da Foz), Kimika (Castelo Branco), Zoo (Porto), among others, where he shared decks with great DJs, both national and international, such as Vibe, Miguel Rendeiro, Jiggy, Gustavo Ribeiro, Serginho, Bobby D’Ambrosio, Kourosh, Rui Vargas, Laura Jones, King Bizz, Rui Murka, Magazino, Mário Roque or Jepe.\r\n\r\nCurrently, he keeps periodic appearances at Lottus After Hours (Porto), at Club da Praça (Mirandela) anda at Ópera Prima (Marinha Grande).\r\n\r\nHis activity as a DJ reflects his eclectic and diversified taste in music. And because music genres are just labels for mental organization and not for the creation of prejudgements, he doesn’t ignore any kind of sound in the field of house music, often incorporating in his sets elements ranging from soulful to tech house, even with occasional winks at techno.",

Later, Ableton Live became his main tool for creating his music and performing live shows. \r\nHe focused on finding his own musical language and sound groove instead of following established styles, constantly improving his production techniques and tools until reaching his own unique sound: Hi Tech \r\nIn 2007 he released his debut album on Silicon Records \"3G: Audio Upgrade\", quickly followed by a single release with his co project Polux (with Porter Rhodes) on spanish label 24 Bit Records.\r\n\r\nOn 2008 he created / developed iTouchMidi, the pioneer iOS suite of midi controllers (available on the App Store).\r\n\r\nCurrently in South America promoting Silicon Records, Nonnus is available for bookings (nonnus@silicon-records.com)",

The music emerges in this life, playing in some events, theaters and festivals related to the music school. Later on, his cousin, which was a DJ and also a club owner, opened his eyes to the sounds of electronic music. \r\nSoon with some friends he starts producing house music and released a few themes and performed live in some of the most important clubs and events in Portugal. \r\n\r\nAfter that, a mutual friend speaks about João Sanhudo and his work like a Dj. They are friends since ever. Together they could explore the electronic music taste with substance and quality. \r\nTalking about João Sanhudo is talking about electronic music. \r\nFrom very early on that, this young man sets out a very close relationship with the machines and everything that involves a Dj booth. He is a versatile artist who knows the dance floor and leads the crowd into a journey of variable sounds of House. \r\n\r\nThis artist has demonstrated throughout his career as a DJ why he has received invitations to perform in some of the best and most important clubs and events. Always with a positive attitude in the cabin, as well as in his life, he holds an enviable technical ability and a coherent and comprehensive musical selection. \r\n\r\nThe musical production is the central objective of these “guyz”, working a lot of hours in their studio.

Ao entrar em contacto com as mesas de mistura e os gira-discos, os vinis e tudo o que envolvia as misturas e depois as primeiras experiências na noite levaram ao amor pela arte do mix. Surgiu entao a oportunidade de trabalho como barman podendo assim estar em contacto com os dj´s que fossem passando pelo seu local de trabalho. Depois de adquirir algum conhecimento, técnicas e truques de como mixar e empolgar uma pista de dança, surgiu a oportunidade de tocar com algumas figuras dos anos 90 em Portugal como: X-Man, XL Garcia, dj Klaude, Oscar Baia, dj Joia, entre outros. Corria o ano de 2002 e, por motivos pessoais e de saúde, foi obrigado a pôr de parte a vida nocturna e o underground voltando mais tarde, ja corria o ano de 2007 ao seu eterno amor, a musica de dança ou ao puro house music e aos clubs. Em 2008 foi dj mensal de uma radio local, tocou em algumas casas e progrediu naturalmente a nível de equipamento e tecnologia passando do vinil para os cdj´s e mais tarde para os controladores digitais. A nível profissional o regresso foi surpreendente, tocando com pedro carrilho, oscar dj, jóia, misterd, pedro diaz, the gess, entre outros. 2010 veio trazer ainda mais novidades sobre NotoriousB, que, numa tentativa de se superar a si mesmo, deu os primeiros passos no campo da produção e, pelas maos da elektronicvibes records, lança a sua primeira faixa experimental com o nome de: Latin Flavoured, faixa que faz parte do ep: esmerald EV003, da mesma editora. Para este ano de 2011, NotoriousB, tem como objectivo principal o lançamento de mais faixas agora a nível mais definitivo e profissional. Sempre em busca de novos desafios, procura agora clubs fora do seu pais para poder mostrar o seu trabalho e dar a conhecer o que de melhor se faz na dance sceene internacional e as suas próprias faixas. NotoriousB tem ainda alguns web links onde vai postando e actualizando sempre que se justifique e que são os seguintes:\r\nwww.facebook.com/djNotoriousB\r\nwww.myspace.com/notoriousbeto\r\nwww.twitter.com/djbeto_nb\r\nwww.residentadvisor.net/dj/notoriousb\r\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/album/e-v-003/id411226872\r\n\r\nDj NotoriousB Bio:\r\n\r\nCarlos Simoes or NotoriousB was born in 1975 in a small town in Portugal called Tomar. His taste for music showed itself early. It was around his 15 years that this taste has turned into something bigger when he come into contact with the mixers and turntables, vinyls and anything involving mixtures. Then came the opportunity to work as a bartender and therefore be in contact with the dj's who were going to play at his workplace. After acquiring some knowledge, techniques and tricks on how to mix and excite a dance floor, the opportunity to play with some figures of 1990 in Portugal as: X-Man, XL Garcia, DJ Klaude, Oscar Baia and dj Joia among others has finally come true. The year was 2002 and for personal reasons and health, was obliged to get away from the nightlife and underground geting back a few years later, in 2007 to his eternal love, the house music. In 2008 he was djing monthly for a local radio, played in some clubs and naturally progressed to the best level of equipment and technology moving from vinyl to cdj and later for digital controllers. His professional return was amazing, playing with Pedro Carrilho, oscardj, dj Joia, misterd, pedro diaz, the gess, among others. 2010 has brought further news on NotoriousB, that in an attempt to overcome himself, took the first steps in the field of production and, by the hands of elektronicvibes records, launches its first experimental track with the name: Latin Flavoured, track that is part of the ep: emerald EV003, the same publisher. For this year 2011, NotoriousB, whose main purpose is the release of more tracks now at a more definitive and professional. Always seeking new challenges, is now looking outside their country for clubs in order to display his work and show what is best made in the international dance scene and his own tracks. NotoriousB still has some web links where he will post and update when appropriate",

  "artist_bio": "Nascido e criado em Olhão, Algarve, terra do marisco e de férias de Verão, Pete iniciou a sua carreira como DJ residente em dois espaços: Mitto, um bar que marcou a diferença na forma como o Sul encara o início da noites e na, agora mítica, Locomia, um club que tinha como paisagem o oceano, na bonita praia de Stª. Eulália, onde tocaram todos os DJs mundialmente conhecidos, durante as épocas de Ver..Em 2006 e deparando-se com uma carreira gigantesca em Portugal Pete Tha Zouk decide juntar-se à WDB. Sob a alçada dos mentores da empresa, José Manso e João Miguel, a carreira de Pete cresce ainda mais e chega a um estatuto que determina Pete Tha Zouk como o DJ mais solicitado em Portugal. Promotores e proprietários de clubes sabem que ter Pete Tha Zouk significa ter “casa cheia”. Quantos DJs podem garantir este sucesso? A WDB não se fica por aqui e lança a carreira do artista além-fronteiras, para o Brasil, Suíça e Angola. No Brasil foi votado como o “DJ Revelação” no Verão de 2009 e na passagem de ano 2010/2011 pela primeira vez Pete Tha Zouk actuou fora de Portugal e foi o Brasil que teve a honra de ver chegar o novo ano na companhia dele. O mundo vem já a seguir.\r\nPete Tha Zouk já ganhou vários prémios: em 2002, a revista Portuguesa Dance Club, galardoou-o com o prémio “Dj Revelação”. Em 2004, ganhou dois prémios atribuídos pela Dance Club, “Melhor Produtor” e “Melhor Single do Ano” (com “Solid Textures”). Venceu também em 2005 e 2006 o título de “Melhor Dj Português” nos Prémios Noite.pt. Em 2008 e 2009 Pete leva para casa o título de “Melhor Dj Português”, galardão atribuído pelos Prémios Noite. pt. Em 2010, Pete ganha mais uma vez o prémio “Melhor Dj Português” atribuído pelos Prémios Radio Nova Era, Melhores do Ano e nos Prémios Noite.pt.\r\n2010 começou com “I’m Back Again”, uma colaboração com Mastercris e a mundialmente famosa Abigail Bailey, que alcançou o topo das tabelas e fez parte de várias compilações pelo mundo. O videoclip foi gravado na magnífica ilha de Florianópolis pelo premiado realizador Português, Leonel Viera. O sucesso deste tema e o sucesso das actuações no Brasil, Angola, Suíça e Portugal, foram determinantes para o ano de 2010 acabar com duas notícias bombásticas: a entrada no Top 100 da DJ Mag em número 81 e a edição de um tema, “Check This Out”, pela Sondos, editora do mundialmente famoso Erick Morillo.\r\n2011 é o ano de viragem e a entrada definitiva no top dos 50 melhores DJs mundiais com o anúncio, a 20 de Outubro, de Pete Tha Zouk ocupar agora o 37º lugar do Top100 da DJ Mag, subindo uns impressionantes 44 lugares e conquistando a mais alta posição de sempre de um DJ Português neste que é o top de referência internacional.\r\nEm 2012 Pete Tha Zouk começa o ano com uma parceria com a DJ e produtora Britânica Rae no tema “Learn To Love”, cujo videoclipe foi filmado integralmente em Hollywood/Los Angeles e realizado por Leonel Vieira. E com a vitória, pelo terceiro ano consecutivo, do prémio de Melhor DJ Português nos prestigiados galardões Melhores do Ano da Rádio Nova Era. O Verão de 2012 traz a estreia no maior festival de Verão Português – o SWTMN – e a actuação de Pete Tha Zouk serviu de cenário para a filmagem do novo tema do DJ, uma co-produção com o jovem talento Deepblue que conta com a voz da norte-americana, Yasmeen, intitulado “We Are Tomorrow”. A 1 de Julho de 2013 é editada a colaboração com Kellie Allen no belíssimo “Been Too Long”.

At 12 years he embraces his first musical role as a punk rock drummer, his first real experience in music.

At 12 years he embraces his first musical role as a punk rock drummer, his first real experience in music. A few years later, he started to grow interest for electronic music, attending rave parties and always watching his brother, Sérgio Oliveira, also a Dj, he who had a definitive role in his choice to bet everything in a Dj career and in his ascension as an artist as well as a person.\r\n\r\nNuno began playing in local discos and gaining name, public and reputation in the electronic music community and later on, he started working at BimotorDJ, where he was one of the managers of the vinyl import/export of electronic music in Portugal. In the year 2000, the Kaos Records mentor, the late Antonio Cunha, invited Nuno to join Rock's Club, one of the best clubs at the time. This was very important, as this club was the main place for the underground scene, which is where he feels musically at home. In 2002 he recorded the double cd \"Funktástica Mix - This is True House Music 2\" and also his first original track, \"Devotion\", released in 2003 on Kaos Records. This was part of the Native ID project, in which he co-worked with his two friends Mike Yost and Danny Theal. This release took his name abroad and made his name a true international one, as it was played and supported by some of the best Dj's in the world, gaining the respect credit from the main magazines in Europe, like DJ Mag UK and others, and featured in several compilations like \"Siddharta (Spirit Of Buddha Bar Vol. 2) by Ravin”, “Rock In Rio Lisboa – Electrónica”, and more. Throughout his career, his skills as a Dj as well as his consistency as a Producer allowed him to play with some of the biggest names on the dance scene as the late Kenny Hawkes (R.I.P.), John Digweed, Little Louie Vega, Green Velvet, Derrick Carter, Tiefschwarz, Lexicon Avenue, Chus & Ceballos, Chicken Lips, Dj Vibe, just to mention a few.\r\n\r\nIn 2005 he was nominated for the category Portuguese Revelation DJ in the Dance Club Awards. In that same year, he joined one of the best Portuguese djs & producers, DJ Jiggy, creating the project called Mitch Boys. Their debut EP, \"Understand & Brought Back\", released by Aenaria, in 2006, property of Luca Ricci, was the starting point on a consistent international career and, since 2005, due to the hype created around him, he managed to play in France, Switzerland, Spain and Luxembourg. In 2008, again as Mitch Boys, they released “Barbarella”, on Substance Music, the New York label owned by Peter Bailey. This release became a song of worship, especially in New York, receiving a fantastic critique from all the greatest Dj's, gaining so much attention all over the world, they would soon had the privilege of playing at the mythic \"Womb \" club in Tokyo, Japan. This was the confirmation of an international adventure and to prove it, he is one of the few artists with an annual residency at that mythic club, a restricted group that features the best artists in the world. It didn't take too long for the second release, a single called “Medicina”, released on the Japanese label, Session Traxx.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, Nuno embraced some other projects with great success. Alongside with his brother, Sérgio Oliveira, renowned Dj as well, they created Oliver Brothers, a dynamic duo which quickly earned the respect of their equals as well as the public due to their awesome performances, based on both brothers' exceptional musical background. Confirming his versatility as an artist, under the name of Malcoman, he starts producing some Hip Hop tracks for artists in the Hip Hop scene.\r\n\r\nIn the future, his plans are to keep on playing as much as possible and to embrace even further his Producer career. There are some releases on the way and the aim is to release his first album by next year so, the future looks promising for this portuguese born and based artist with a heart and talent as big as the world!\r\n\r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Se a noite lisboeta fosse uma selva, Paulo Nupi seria um camaleão, adaptando-se como poucos aos espaços para onde é convidado para a tarefa de tratar da bando sonora. - Marcelo de MagalhãesPaulo Nupi é um dj que gosta de dançar. O seu lema é uma frase roubada à Miss Kittin: \"How can you be a dj if you don't like to shake your ass in the middle of the crowd?”\r\nCedo revelou gosto pela música. Aos quatro anos, já tocava o conhecido hit O Pretinho Barnabé e fazia scratch com Os Patinhos. Esgotada essa técnica, decidiu dedicar-se à produção, com o novo xilofone Hammond oferecido no Natal, aos oito anos. Dois anos depois, uma ida à discoteca em Benidorm, acompanhado da irmã, deixou-o deslumbrado. A partir daí, viu o seu destino traçado.\r\nMais tarde, por pressões familiares, rumou a Lisboa para se licenciar. Influenciado pela vaga rave, escolheu engenharia química. Mas como gostava muito de dançar, e preferia ouvir música a mexer em tubos de ensaio, passava a vida no Bairro Alto.\r\nNo Bairro teve a sua primeira residência como dj, na Capela, considerada a catedral da música electrónica em Lisboa.\r\nIncansável pesquisador musical, actualmente é um dos djs mais requisitados de Lisboa, animando habitualmente vários espaços como o Lux, a Capela, O Estado Líquido, O Lei Seca, o Clube da Esquina, O Arena Lounge no Casino de Lisboa, O Mexe Café, O Fluid ou o Op Art, etc.\r\nGosta de lidar com o aspecto lúdico da música sem pôr de lado as preocupações culturais contemporâneas, estando sempre muito atento às novas tendências e correntes musicais que vão surgindo no panorama artístico internacional.\r\nQue música?\r\n“House, tecnho, idm, funk e tudo à volta. Tudo o que tenha um certo sabor mental e dê balanço ao corpo. Os sets variam conforme o local: não tocarei os mesmos discos numa mega rave e num bar pequeno. Por exemplo, no Clube da Esquina opto por um registo mais soulfull e alguns hits trans-geracionais, ao passo que na Capela tenho um registo mais cru, mas sempre com algum groove, algures numa fusão entre o techno, o dub e o house. No lux também varia consoante o andar em que toco, mas sou bastante mais instintivo, pois é uma pista que o permite. Ou seja, funciono mais de acordo com as pessoas presentes na sala do que com uma linha sonora pré-estabelecida. Talvez por isso resulte uma amálgama sonora sempre diferente. De uma maneira geral detesto amarras e limites. Festa é festa. Life celebration: é isto a música para mim. Quando olho para a pista, gosto de ver alegria acima de tudo. Fico feliz por poder fazer os outros felizes ainda que momentaneamente. O abanar das ancas, o olhar reluzente, o descontrolo, o desvario, a exaltação, out of control, a dança sentida.”\r\nAs 3 melhores festas em que trabalhaste?\r\n“Sem dúvida o terraço do Lux no sexto aniversário.\r\nO after de uma das Festas das Flores no Indústria.\r\nA segunda vez que toquei na pista do Lux, parecia um furacão.\r\nUm domingo inusitado no Op Art… à meia noite e meia já estavam a arredar mesas e cadeiras… foi a desbunda até às 8 da manhã.”\r\nAs 3 melhores em que não trabalhaste?\r\n“O Sonar em Barcelona durante uma actuação do Laurent Garnier.\r\nA Festa das Flores do Miguel Ângelo.\r\nO Goa em Madrid.\r\nA primeira vez do François Kevorkian no Lux.\r\nE todas aquelas que nem me lembro da música.” Colegas de cabine?\r\n“Nathan Fake, Craig Richards (Fabric), Wighnomy Brothers, Oskar Meltzer, Trevor Jackson, Freshkitos, Andre Galuzzi, Le Hammond Inferno, Rui Vargas, Andy H, Dexter, Expander, Rui Murka, Ellen Alien, Superpitcher, Lino Rodriguez, Expander, Tozé Diogo, Zé Pedro Moura, Dj Al, Bruno Correia, Mauro Crachat, Miguel Sá, Kaspar entre muitos outros.”\r\nProjectos para o futuro?\r\n“Evolution: I'm a work in progress!”\r\n\r\nMaria Antónia Oliveira e António Néu\r\n\r\nhttp://sindicato.biz/",

It was distinguished as \"DJ Promise\" by the prestigious portal Portuguese Dance Music '100% Deejay'. He launched his first original in the Portuguese market and the calls for the most notably performances began to emerge.\r\n\r\nDuring this \"journey\" of nine years in the world of electronic music, he formed two projects in pairs, with the first being with Mr.Cube and the second with Nuno Valente, known bt the name of Soundriders, together they launched original sets and a solo. Worked with leading publishers and International compilations (Moganga (Gregor Salto), Recovery House, Dadadam, G-REX Music (Gregor Salto), Tanira Records, Control Room Records, Wicked Music ...), starred in some countries like Spain, Morocco, England, beyond their country native where already served from north to south of Portugal. His originals obtained recognition, and important DJs remixes of electronic international scene, and even some part of the restricted tracklist's radio show's like Shut Up & Dance \"(D & D)\", Release Yourself \"(Roger Sanchez)\", Tocacabana \"(Tocadisco)\".\r\n\r\nMyne gradually transcended beyond the Djing. He is now responsible for the brand 'Control Room Records' which keeps his partnership with his friend and DJ Mr.Cube, producing events based in Tech house and Techno lines beyond the normal publishing work.\r\n\r\nLINKS:\r\n\r\nwww.facebook.com/DJMYNE \r\nhttps://pro.beatport.com/artist/myne/398470",

Dos 90 ou do século XXI, nunca, em momento algum, são as raízes\r\ndo house confundidas com qualquer barulho desenvolvido pelas tendências massivas. Do seu deck saem\r\napenas basslines puras, simples e fieis ao propósito que o move.\r\nO I será certamente de intenso. Décibeis tentaculares vão-te puxar para o centro da pista, o teu \r\ncorpo vai-se mover, quase em modo automático. Vais-te rir, mas não vais estranhar!\r\nO U avisa que é único. Junkie da procura, o seu set viaja entre o novo, o velho e o assim-assim.\r\nO que toca tem apenas em comum o selo da qualidade.\r\nTer uma mala de discos bem composta qualquer um tem. Ter a capacidade de fazer mexer uma qualquer\r\npista de dança, já é uma capacidade que só se adquire ao longo dos anos.\r\nMas que o PIU tem.\" \r\n\r\nTexto: Jotinha",

In 2011 Rui accepted the invitation to work with local event promotor Elements and this association is a step forward in his relationship with music, with invitations to play some of the events and most important clubs in the city of Coimbra alongside some DJ he admires such as: David Rodrigues, Nelson Flip, A.Paul, Jiggy, The Advent, Deepbass, Brando Lupi, Nobody Home, Blndr, Ntogn and Antigone.

  "artist_bio": "DJ BOOKINGS: oneeyedjackslabel@gmail.com //  Photonz is the artist name of Marco Rodrigues, a London-based DJ and producer who's been championing the new sound of Portuguese house and techno worldwide since the early 2000s. He started the label One Eyed Jacks in 2010 and hosts the weekly radio show Principio da Incerteza on Lisbon's Oxigenio radio, going on strong for six year now. This year Photonz was also made one of the resident hosts for the Unknown To The Unknown 2015 shows on London's fav underground radio station, NTS.The sound delivered by Photonz on his DJ sets and productions blends the bold, romantic side of rave's original spirit with a new sound carved borrowing from experimental music and psychedelia. The result is a unique signature that has gained support from key figures of the electronic music scene like Legowelt, Ben UFO, DJ TLR, Jackmaster and Ivan Smaghe. \r\n\r\nSince his debut in 2006 with \"Ronin\", Photonz has released on labels such as Andy Blake's Dissident, Pilookski's Dirty, R-Zone (the enigmatic sublabel of Crème Organization), and DJ Haus' Unknown To The Unknown. The latter put out some his best work, with the EP \"Hurt Me Hurt Me\" getting a 10/10 review in DJ Mag and the track \"1551\" being played in Jackmaster's first ever BBC Essential Mix appearance.\r\n\r\nHe has so far remixed artists as diverse as the Detroit legend Anthony 'Shake' Shakir, UK pop icon Alison Moyet, Dan Avery, Zebra Katz, Alice Russell, Shadow Dancer among many others. And as a DJ he combines his previous experience as a resident at various Lisbon venues with frequent performances in cities like Berlin, London, Paris, Lyon, Antwerp ot Barcelona and festivals like Sònar, Lovebox or Sudoeste.\r\n\r\nLast year Photonz released \"Osiris Resurrected\" on Unknown To The Unknown, with a Palms Trax remix and the DJ support from Ben UFO and John Talabot. This year he dropped his hommage to Legowelt with the aptly titled \"Gnosis of Wolfers EP\" on one of the labels that influenced him the most, the legendary Crème Organization - a release that Blawan compared to his \"favourite lasagna\" in what could be on of this year's most inspired DJ feedbacks.",

Inspired by contemporary artists and looking for a musical philosophy of self-identity, he became a professional musician in 2005.\r\nAfter having traveled around the world performing his own music, being played by the biggest artists in the electronic scene since 2006, he is living a rich and productive period of creation with all the energy, experience and maturity acquired over the past years.\r\nIn 2014 he released the “Synthesize” EP on Planet Rhythm and “Interstellar” EP on his own Label – Monocline Records, which was the highest moment in his career, supported by names such as Ben Klock, DVS1, Pfirter, Jeroen Search, Truncate, Tale Of Us, Scuba, Dasha Rush, Adriana Lopez and many more.\r\n2015 promises new releases and many performances around the world…",

Since then he always gives the best un each set. \r\nAs a DJ he hasn’t the goal to be the best in this art, he´s only looking forward to create emotions, musical environments, contrasts and silences. That’s Music! He wants to “give” what he had received from the artist that have fed his soul taking us to unknown places that no one imagined!\r\n\r\nwww.facebook.com/ricardosantos.dj\r\nwww.twitter.com/ricardosantos.dj\r\nwww.soundcloud.com/ricardojvs-1\r\nwww.soundcloud.com/studio_h\r\nfor booking: \r\nstudioh.dj@hotmail.com",

He started to learn music  while very young and at the age of 17 he was a professional violin player.  He is always inside the musical scenne no mather the genre but dance music is an inspirational frontier that is allowing him to enlarge his bonds. His music and productions are a mix of diferent genres ranging from pop to house, nu/disco to rock.\r\n\r\nThe first release of the artist was out on Syntomatique Records on 2012  whilst tracks already appear on labels such as Amati Records, Plastik Galaxy and Midnight Express Records . Various collaborations took place in alongside fellow mates Meko for critically acclaimed remixes and EP's, In particular the Sarasate remix on Meko - Falling.

With the streets being their most expressive metaphor for genius and the ability to shape the music that they present their sets.\r\nThe need to share to one another what they know so well became evident through a lasting friendship and a common passion until 2008, where they decided to perform live the project that was being dreamt for some time.\r\nPassionate for different electronic music tendencies, from the abstract house to the purest and elemental techno, they distinguish themselves on how they embrace and fuse different musical influences. The shaping of these elements end through a rhythm blast where music is a shuttle towards an inner voyage.\r\nThe constant variation of stimuli revisit memories from the past, looking for allies in the most recent tendencies, never losing their individuality. The evasion from reality, the escape and the journey. This is Ruuar’s vision.",

  "artist_bio": "Rygen could have become a marvellous cook, a comics villain or even a professional greeter, but he missed it!If at least someone had kept him from buying two turntables and a device equivalent to a hand blender (though for mixing music) back in 1999, he might have reached stardom in any of those three. Stubborn as a mule, he insisted in developing skills as a disc jockey, though it’s hard to figure out what for.\r\n\r\nThey say it’s not an easy task to catalog this guy’s music selections when it’s party time. Is that really true?\r\nWell, one thing is certain: from his first gigs till the present day, Rygen has always been passionate about presenting people with music which is new to them.\r\n\r\nYou’ll easily find him involved with a group of outlaws named \"Enlarge Your Audio\" and he was also part of the portuguese djs & promoters collective \"Da Providers\". \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPT\r\n---\r\n\r\nRygen podia ter sido um grande cozinheiro, um vilão de banda desenhada, ou um prolífico arrumador de carros, mas ainda não foi desta! Bastava que em 1999 o tivessem proibido de comprar dois gira discos e um outro aparelho equivalente a uma batedeira, mas para misturar música, e talvez pudesse ter-se realizado como um desses três. Teimoso que nem uma mula, insistiu em desenvolver as suas capacidades como jóquei dos discos, sabe-se lá para quê.\r\n\r\nDizem que não é fácil catalogar o gajo quanto às sonoridades que escolhe, na hora do bailarico. Será verdade?\r\nUma coisa é certa: desde as suas primeiras festas até ao dia de hoje, sempre adorou surpreender as pessoas com música que ainda não ouviram.\r\n\r\nFacilmente o encontram associado ao aglomerado de bandidos intitulado de \"Enlarge Your Audio\", que nasceu no Trintaeum no Porto, e fez parte da equipa de djs dos Da Providers e da Freima.",

He bought his first pair of technics turntables and some records in 96 and at the end of the same year he met his good friend dj MJ and also the owners of a new portuguese label and starts co-producing a track for the label's first release. His own record came out in 97 (lupeca003) followed one year later by a second (lupeca005). Both received excelent reviews, promoting the label and his career as a dj, mixing at the biggest clubs and events. Production slowed down and from 2000 to 2002 he was the co-owner and one of the dj's of a small club in Faro, the Algarve's capital. The club (Prior) was a way of promotion to electronic music in the city and region, releasing some small events with some respected portuguese dj's. Since then, you can hear him in some local clubs, where he mix many musical genres, from house to minimal, with a touch of disco and old school.",

Thanks to him, Porto can already dance to the sound of some of the most surprising DJ sets, with careful dynamics and selections and structured elegance. With a robust musical culture resulting from continuous and systematic research work, Tiago is one of the leading DJs of his generation. He is influenced by the sounds that, since the genesis of electronic dance music, have reached us from Detroit, Chicago, Berlin or London. With the birth of the label, Terrain Ahead, which he founded with Ivo Pacheco and LuÃ­s Dourado, he has assumed the name of Solution for his own work, as a DJ and musician. Following the editorial principles of open exploration of contemporary electronic musical production in various aesthetic dimensions, the music produced by Solution has been based on combining foundations of Techno, House and Electro with a discreet, firm but contained experimentalism, with a distinctive personality, typically exploring the more murky territories of minimalism, including constructions based on crystalline precision.",

Thinkfreak bets on an introspective relationship that, by experimentation, searches for the link between elements of sound and mental landscapes built by the environment surrounding him. The result is the darker side of techno with progressive and minimal influences, alternated with moments of a delighted emotional release, leading the public to feel high contrasting states of euphoria and introspection.\r\n\r\nIn Portugal, Thinkfreak highlights by his live performances in clubs such as Lux Fragil, Gare Porto and Clubbing - Casa Da Música .

He jumped to the booth around the year 1998, but took it more seriously like 10 years ago, when begun to be requested for the best portuguese clubs.\r\nNext step, and the most important one, was the professional connection with his \"old\" friend Alain Ho, also known as Dj Yellow, when the idea of working together as Mindz Kontrol Ultra came up. This fusion with his number one reference in music, helped push things in a deeper, minimal and stripped back classic house direction in a proper clubbing way.\r\nComposite Records was next! Alain and Tiago's young label, Composite Records, became the platform of their work and where you can find the fusion of the experience and knowledge like King Britt, Dubfire or Djul'z, with the fresh blood, full of healthy irreverence as Till Von Sein, Varoslav, James Teej, Daniel Kyo, Simon Garcia or Alex James. After the first release at Dieb Audio, Tiago released (also as MKU) his next 3 Eps at Composite, but soon capture the attention of other labels like Ovum Recordings, Freerange Records and Plastic City (album). In that hot summer of 2009, he got \"Fubu\" from his 4 released, featured at the 10 Years Cocoon Ibiza compilation, for Cocoon Records, by invitation of Locodice, \"Sleep with me\" (Josh Wink Edit) at Space Ibiza Compilation for Cr2 Records and \"Space soon to vanish\" for Global Underground, just to name a few.\r\nEnd of September 2010 is time to receive Tiago's solo debut Ep \"Face\" (Composite), with remixes of My Favorite Robot and Michael J Collins, greatly supported by James Teej, Manik, Art Department, Phonogenic, Till Von Sein, Roland Appel, Roberto Rodriguez and many others…\r\nTiago's second solo work called \"Lovefool\", alongside Tracey K with remixes of Alain Ho and Jay Shepheard comes around June, ready to be one of summer anthems, and reaching 40th position at Beatport's Deep House 100 Chart. A couple of months later and his last release, \"Special\", a track build with Dj Yellow and vocals by Tracey K, featured at Composite's VA Compilation, got huge support around the world as Maya Jane Coles, Steve Bug, Cera Alba, Guy J, Chez Damier among many others and reaching top 13 of Beatport's Deep House Chart. More to come soon.\r\nSo stay tuned guys!",

O desejo de sentir a música começou cedo, e sempre gostou de ouvir e sentir a música. No final dos anos 80 teve uma banda de rock Português .. Foi uma experiência muito interessante e que mais uma vez o levou a estar próximo da música, onde sempre gostou de intervir. No início dos anos 90, estava totalmente absorvido pela música eletrônica, desde o tribal, house e techno. Comecou a comprar Vinil (no Porto @ discomundo)e reproduzi-los em hi-fi rudimentar (apenas para o sentimento!). Neste momento, dedica grande parte do seu tempo para experimentar novas músicas, desde o funk, jazz, house, deephouse e techno. Não consegue viver sem música… Até ao próximo encontro musical .. fica por perto:\r\n\r\nEu, rui A.K.A. THEE RUIFLIP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKING 00351914225490 INFO@THEERUIFLIPBOOKING.COM",

  "artist_bio": "Twofold is London-born, DJ and producer currently living in Lisbon, for whom the concept of flat, loop-based, four-to-the-floor dance music is most definitely something to be shunned.Taking sonic cues from DJ’s and musicians such as James Holden, Andrew Weatherall, Michael Mayer, Apparat, Luke Abbott, Nathan Fake, or Fairmont, the first records he heard from Kompakt and Border Community were all the impulse he needed to move back to his hometown to pursue a degree in sound engineering. While there, he was fortunate enough to land a few prestigious gigs warming up for DJ’s such as Mobilee’s Dan Curtin, Serge Santiago or Timo Garcia.\r\n\r\nSince returning to Portugal in early 2009, he has shared DJ booths with a lot of the artists who inspired him at the first place like Nathan Fake, Extrawelt, Luke Vibert, Jon Hopkins, Mark Henning, or Applescal. He has played in all of Portugal’s best clubs including Lux, Gare and Musicbox and at festivals such as Neopop, Festival Forte, the world renowned BOOM FESTIVAL, RitterButzke in Berlin, and Vlla in Amsterdam\r\n\r\nAs a producer he has released music on the berlin-based Aromamusic among others. In 2013 he founded Two Dots Recordings a label/collective based in Lisbon and Stockholm with longtime friend Thomm (Paperweight). His first track for the label, “Omission” was later picked up by Fever, who have put out music by Max Cooper, Gabriel Ananda, Applescal, Wesley Matsell and Avus, among many others.\r\n\r\nHe kicked off 2014 with an invitation from the Red Bull Music Academy to play at the second edition of Boiler Room in Lisbon. The reaction to his performance was overwhelmingly positive with many people declaring his set as the best of the evening. A host of invitations followed including Rock In Rio, a return to the Boom Festival, Festival Forte, the closing set at Outjazz, and he rounded out the year with a well received gig in Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nIn January of 2015 he was asked to return to the Boiler Room where he played an explosive set with good friend and frequent studio collaborator, SwitchSt(d)ance, followed by a memorable evening at Lux. To round off the month he played at Musicbox with Ninja Tune mainstay Falty DL. The combination of powerful percussive elements, hypnotic melodies and an eclectic and often surprising musical selection, make Twofold one of Portugal’s most interesting underground artists.",

But it was the following year that really saw him broke into the club scene, when he started a residency at Café da Praça: there, it took him only one and a half years for his performances become somewhat a cult.\r\nSimultaneously, Serginho collaborated with the project UrbanSound where he secured a monthly residency and performed frequently in Club Rock’s. During this period, he also became a resident DJ at Bela Cruz and later he went back to the place where everything began, Café na Praça.\r\nIn 1999, with the opening of Club Voice, the career of the young DJ experienced yet again another impulse: his performances as resident DJ in the first floor of this venue in Porto have remained until today in the collective memory of the true house music lovers. Therefore it was not strange that Serginho got an invitation to produce his own show in Radio Voxx and, in 2001, a nomination for the Revista de Dança Awards, in the “Breakthrough DJ” category.\r\nFrom then on, Serginho’s DJ skills were even more in demand: he performed in several venues and events, all over the country, including the autonomous regions of Madeira and Azores. During this period, he played in iconic clubs such as Vaticano Club, Hit Club, Buddha Club, Indústria Porto, Club Mau Mau, Swing, Maré Alta, Oito Graus Oeste, Via Latina, The Day After, Indústria Lisboa, Paradise Garage, Locomia and Kadoc (just to name a few), alongside top names of the dance scene, including DJ Vibe, Frank Maurel, Ralph Lawson, Miguel Migs, Little Louie Vega, Kings Brit, Dixon, Layo & Bushwacka, Charles Webster, X-Press 2, Josh Wink, Harvey, Giles Petterson, Jazzanova, Glimmer Twins, Idjut Boys, Tiefschwarz, Kid & Khan, Ivan Smagghe (Black Strobe), Spektrum, Ricardo Villalobos, among others.\r\nIn September of 2004, as the result of a strong and lasting relation with Indústria, Serginho was invited to be a resident DJ in this prominent club of Porto nightlife. He stayed for two years.\r\nSince then, Serginho has performed regularly as a guest in several clubs. His performances in Pitch, Maré Alta, Indústria and in the “Reverse” nights, where he plays back-to-back with Zé Salvador, stand out as memorable. Serginho really imposes is own personal style – very distinctive, elegant and utterly contemporary, reasons for which his work is admired by the likes of Alex Kid and Radio Slave.\r\nUpcoming releases @ Unless Records",

  "artist_bio": "Stereo Headz is the alter ego of a whole new world of audio and visual possibilities (Luis Norte).Stereo Headz is the alter ego of a whole new world of audio and visual possibilities (Luis Norte).\r\n\r\nOver the last twelve years Luis Norte has been an active participator on the electronic music community as a DJ, a Producer, a Performer and an Events Agency owner.\r\n\r\nBorn in Marinha Grande, Leiria in Portugal always has been passionate about music and technology influenced by his father's record collection and music equipments.\r\n\r\nIn the late '80s he often woke up at the middle of the night to go to the front of the radio to record music and make his own mix tapes, and soon he discovered the legendary Jeff Mills and the Detroit Techno sounds.\r\n\r\nIn the early '90s Norte became a faithful follower of the electronic culture and at that time he had the opportunity to discover Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson and Richie Hawtin, these are the artists that inspired him to begin his journey as a DJ.\r\n\r\nIn 2001 Norte started the Hi-Techno division, with the goal to promote the accomplishments of electronic music events, betting in the originality. With these events he had the chance to invite some of the best DJ’s of the world, teasing their public with the best performances that only these artists can provide. Focused on his DJ career from 2001 to 2003, at this time he already had the opportunity to share the stage with great artists such as: Adam Beyer, Redhead, DJ Misjah, Jesus del Campo, Jiggy, A. Paul, and much more.\r\n\r\nThe natural progression from DJ'ing to music production was very quick, in 2004 he created the LN Technologies, an electronic music production project motivated by the will to state his ideas and influences, the non-stop day and night studio sessions allowed him to acquire knowledge in the field of the music production.\r\n\r\nIn 2006 Norte started a partnership with DJ/Producer, Mark Anthony and they brought the Stereo Headz alter ego into the light, with the goal to concentrate ideas and bet in the new electronic music tendencies. After their first released began, an intense period of experimentation hours after hours of music production resulted in several records. This period was marked by their participation on Lula's album \"The Underground Sound Of Portugal And Me\" on Kult Records (USA) which includes an unreleased re-edit (By KULT's own Eddie Cumana) of the Underground Sound Of Lisbon Mix of her 1998 debut single \"Goosebumps\" with NYLX (aka Rui Da Silva, Danny Tenaglia, DJ Vibe) courtesy of Twisted Records and mixes from Rui Da Silva, Carlos Fauvrelle & Jiggy, Carlos Manaça and Kult Of Krameria, all mixes have madness spoken words from the Queen of the Speaker Lula. This long process of maturation in the studio settled the tones direction and ideology for Norte's next steps.\r\n\r\nContinuing his forward progression, 2010 saw Norte bringing his Stereo Headz persona into the stage and introducing many of his studio ideas on his performances.\r\n\r\nNowadays, he is using the new technologies possibilities in the electronic music field in a consequent and creative way. The real-time creation and manipulation of the individual elements plays an important role on his performances. Due to the combination with several software and hardware, his current setup offers to him practically endless possibilities.\r\n\r\nNorte's sound was continuously evolved during his career, always through his Techno roots. His musical style goes from Tech-House to Techno, with Minimal in between. His energetic and vibrant performances are marked by a very personal musical line, the basses are strong and involving, the melodies provide a constant set of pleasant emotions and environments, and the percussion sounds are well defined resulting in exciting rhythms. On the stage his performances together with his joy and interaction skills allows him to exchange emotions with the Party-People.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Norte keeps working on the improvement of his music setup because he believes that the evolution of the electronic music equipments let the artist be more creative and bring better performances.",

It sounds strange at first, confusing even, some sort of beat out of rhythm, too slow, too dense, too unknown, too naked, too real. There are lots of definitions you can choose from: electronic, hypnotic, gothic, psychedelic, melodic, organic, minimalistic, futuristic, introspective. But besides clichés, it is all about music for the brain, brain music if you may, because if you pay attention, if you take time to understand it, these melodies, these beats take hold of you, they feed your mind and embrace your body, making you feel like your floating over the dance floor. If you think you’re going to a club to chat or flirt, think again or come later. Here it’s all about you and the music - its hypnotic and retro arpeggiators, sometimes out of tune, sometimes out of tempo, introspective soundscapes - and the deep journey you get into.\r\n\r\nMarco Antão is the man behind the name, reminiscence of a skateboard maneuver. Born in early 80's, Marco is Portuguese with heritage from Goa, India. He is one of the resident DJs from Lux club, in Lisbon, status owned over three years ago, when he won Via Heineken competition over 1000 other contestants. James Holden, Four Tet, Nicolas Jaar, Ivan Smagghe, Actress, Caribou, Nathan Fake, Margot, Super Flu, Fairmont, Nosaj Thing, Floating Points are some of his main influences and already shared the stage with Marco. Fresh and passionate, his electronic music also made random appearances at Europa, Faktory Club, Music Box, Boom Festival and other clubs and festivals around Portugal. Amsterdam, Warsaw, Lublin, Wroclaw and Kraków already danced to this noisy guy, what about you?",

This signature was adopted after 6 years of sharing the mixer (DJ booth), with an identity strengthened by common ideals, eclectic tastes, and a creative freedom that allows them to run all the spoils of electronic music without any boundaries.\r\n\r\nAttentive to the reality of the world we live in, this duo – inspired by the underground and in an assumed warning position – bring us to the extreme situations and difficult survival to which man is subjected to in many places of the globe, and that civilization continues to ignore as if it wouldn’t affect us at all. The Slum Vagabunds arise as the representative name of memory and awareness to the imbalance that still exists in this so called modern world, where no one is absolutely saved.\r\n\r\nIn an analogy between all of that has been mentioned and music, The Slum Vagabunds present themselves from their operation booth, and we can realise that their alternative line, far from the mainstream, is what makes their brand imprint gain strength in musical aspects ranging from deep house to “modern techno.”\r\n\r\nIt’s their underground status, perfected for a vast minority, that characterise their sets as unpredictable and original.\r\n\r\nThe expectation is always there, as they never go through the same rails, and as they cross old school revivals with endless alternatives that music, as well as life, can offer us along the path. The world is full of possibilities.",

Instead of buying a yellow convertible they waste their money on samplers, analog synthesizers and sequencers.\r\n\r\nI guess no-one ever told them that a Ferrari get's you laid, a Moog doesn't. This nearly autistic hoarder behavior can only be justified by the mighty bass that make the walls tremble or the beauty of the music that floats down the speakers like no horse has ever done to Cicciolina. Hefner himself is thinking of hiring the bachelors as official knicker droppers at \"the\" mansion.\r\n\r\nSteve Angello you'd better start mixing instead of clapping hands 'cause these juggernauts can actually work around the booth (or at least they hire very small pygmies to do the job for them). They fuse into some sort of four harmed beast and you'd better pay your respect and face the music 'cause there's no way around it: the basterds have got you held in a electronical stronghold.\r\n\r\nThere certainly is more to Voxels than what meets the eye. The guys over at Top Billin and Enchufada have already seen the light. What are you waiting for? There's no messiah coming for you...\r\n\r\nAndrÃ© \"Monsta\" Carvalho",

He’s part of a generation that grew up within the music-blog eruption fueled by Do It Yourself ethics. \r\nHis influences are as diverse as his record collection consequently his productions are eclectic and self-freshened as it’s not easy not to get surprised every time he releases something. Although you can simply label it as Disco or House, the truth is that there is a unique watermark on his sound. That versatility is also visible in his performances. You can travel from fresh-funk to a deeper mood without losing consistency as he can soundtrack from Miami palm-trees to Berlin cold nights; and everything in between. \r\nAfter releasing the ep “The Best Of Me” (on Kris Menace label Work It Baby) he gained a real recognition among more established and well-known artists and opinion-makers, and his underground cult become more ample. The title song was even categorized as the “Stardust” of 2011 on Buzz-charts. Fun-fact. (I Hate The Sound of) Guitars retained a big recognition due to both its idiosyncrasy and video and the new single, PUMA, breathes old contemporary old-school. \r\nTogether with his friends and work-partners Moullinex and Mr. Mitsuhirato he gave birth to the still-growing-influent Discotexas, a Record Label which is getting more and more followers and admirers and is stepping further to a respectable dimension of scene-credibility.   \r\n",

  "artist_bio": "Chapter 1The muscial analysis began prematurely when Vitor Silveira danced alone to the rhyhm of his Dad´s 12\" . His musical preferences where distinguisable from early on from those of his friends who during that time listened to Badaró” and the extremely well known “Areias o Camelo”. Meanwhile Vitor insisted on listening to Disco and Funk tunes inappropriate for his age. Always interested in the skills of DJs, he lost a fair part of his time on nights out admiring their mixing. In 2005 Vitor began to work in a bar in Lisbon as a barman and at the end of each night he took the opportunity to constantly practise what he knew on their decks. At the beginning of 2006 a big opportunity arose! Vitor Vítor was invited last minute to do his first gig at an after hours slot at the B4 club in Lisbon, he nervously accpeted the task and as it went well he was invited to be a resident DJ from then on. From then on everything began to gain momentum. Within a short space of time he was sharing the spotlight with guest DJs like Ka§par, Rui Murka, Gonçalo Siopa, Trol 2000 Joao Maria, Pan Sorbe, Señor Pelota amongst others.",

Although known to many mainly by his countless productions, but it is as a DJ that his name and skills speak louder. He Spins a very own blend of hard, straight , minimal (not the wimpy stuff), tribal, chicago, booty, wonky techno with a unique groove, with a very peculiar and personal style. The main essence behind his sets is hard funkness, bringing an unexplainable mood to his audience, whether it's with the strong and faster side, or with the funky \"get yo rump' on tha dance floor\" needed for everyone to give their body shakin'. With his unique take on Djing he gives birth to a full-on experience based on creating a travel through different sounds and shades of techno, yet seamlessly blending different styles like the getho with the minimal and the tribal, making it altogether an intensive experience by nature (\"3 decker\" alert). He could briefly be described as a very creative and improvising DJ who makes the essence of his sets come straight out of his heart (And what a twisted one!), having a very unique characteristic style of top quality mixing with considerable high speed (see the resemblance between him and the russian MIG plane?), but mainly its just jolly good fun checking the huge amount records he's able to pile after spinning a \"simple\" 2h set!!",

He was so excited by what he saw that he decided to get his own 1200’s and at the age of 12, he and a friend taught themselves the art of mixing.\r\nIn the mid 90’s he started organizing his own events in youth clubs and before he knew it, he was playing in venues all around Portugal where people loved his sense of rhythm and his natural dance floor dynamics. He developed his own, very popular concept called “Saturday” where he booked International artists such as Gayle San, Trevor Rocklife, Mike Dearborn, Craig Walsh and Josh Wink, to mention but a few, making him practically a household name in Portugal.\r\n\r\nPeople were starting to notice the young Wla and his value was recognized when he was invited to join the X-Club, which was at that time the biggest booking agency in Portugal, permitting him to play among some of the biggest names in techno history such as Jeff Mills, Sven Väth, Ritchie Hawthin, Adam Beyer among many.\r\n\r\nIn the late 90’s he set up his home studio and started producing, bringing out his first track on “Squeeze Records” in 2000. He started his own label called “Brotech” and the success was immediate, selling over 3000 copies of the first release “First Step” which was licensed to many CD compilations and mixed by many worldwide names such as Tiga, Space Djs and WJ Henze.\r\nHis unique style was in demand and he was invited to record and remix for other International labels such as “Bush Records” where his EP “Work in Progress” was charted by Carl Cox for 5 straight weeks. This led to other releases on “Naked Lunch”, “Yin & Yang”, “Kombination Research” , “Ekhoport” and “Minishetch”, throwing Wla onto the International dance scene, where he has been performing in venues throughout the world ever since.\r\n\r\nWla’s sound, has more recently developed his labels “Brotech” and the more recent “Intension Musik”, inviting worldwide artists to perform\r\n\r\nWla, while transmitting his “joie de vivre” behind the turntables spinning with some of the greatest artists in the world is also producing some of the finest electronic music coming out of Portugal.",

  "artist_bio": "Ze Salvador is one of the most respected Djs of the Portuguese House scene. Having begun is activity around 1994, Ze Salvador built himself a steady reputation as one of the most ambitious and groundbreaking Djs of his generation. His style is tight and open-minded at the same time and his sets are equally intense and challenging, accepting with simplicity every language that makes today’s independent electronic music so stimulating...Building a 20-year long career in the Portuguese dance music scene isn´t something many DJs can show in their CV. Zé Salvador has built it based on a reputation as one of the most reliable and knowledgeable DJs in the country. With his personalized take on influences like Idjut Boys, Dj Harvey, Ron Trent, Chez Damier, Theo Parrish, Moodymann, Ricardo Villalobos, Ata, to mention a few, it´s safe and fair to say, that Salvador is one of the mainstays of the Portuguese DJing world.\r\n\r\nVersatile, groundbreaking and always a step ahead, Zé Salvador was, and remains, connected to many decisive moments and movements of this collective history. In the 90s, he founded and was a resident at the mythical Urbansound club in Porto, thus putting his personal stamp in the growth of the scene in the north of the country. He influenced the tastes of many as a selector and curator for the record store chain Valentim De Carvalho. In 2001, along with Tozé Diogo, he compiled and mixed the “Chill On Kaos Vol. 2” mix-CD for the historical Kaos Records, considered the best portuguese mix-CD of that year. Further on, he opened the most highly cherished micro-club in Lisbon, Brownie, and became a pillar in the roster of one of the biggest popularity phenomenons in the Portuguese underground, the Bloop Recordings label and promotion agency.\r\n\r\nAlways adventurous and unwilling to simply rest on these laurels, his consistent yet challenging DJing style has been given a place in the most important clubs and festivals in the country (Gare Club, Lux, Indutria, SBSR, A Week In Paradise Called Portugal, Boom Festival’14, NeoPop, Optimus Alive, just to name a few). His association to João Maria and Jorge Caiado in the Carpet and Snares record store and the Carpet Music agency is a natural step and a sum much greater than all these parts, showing that for Zé Salvador, the path and enjoyment of the ride is as important as it´s destination.\r\n\r\nText by Nuno Mendonça",
