This 18 year old DJ/Producer from Holland is currently climbing his way up to the top! Ricover is inspired by all kinds of music; you can hear it in de melodic way of mixing, but you can also hear it in his productions. Quickly after the launch of the first mixtape, Ricover started with his own events and as the Ricover movement grew, he sold out big clubs in the Netherlands. You probably know him for his excellent choice of records the audience wants to hear. He shared the stage with great artists like Nicky Romero, Oliver Heldens, Julian Calor, La Fuente, Artisic Raw and many more. “I want to show everyone that if you pursue your dreams, they can come true. If you don’t give up, you can make anything happen. My biggest joy is to see people dancing to my music and having a great time.

While starting out as a substitute dj in a small dutch pub in 2006, Rico now has a promising career as a DJ and producer with international stature. At a young age music influenced him. His mother performed as a lead singer in a jazz band and Rico used to play with the instruments during practices. This led to an early interest in music. At the age of sixteen he started playing in a local Dutch pub. During his early time there he learned how to respond and adapt to the crowd and interact with them. He gained technical skills, and perhaps more importantly: the capability to create a balance between contemporary music and new musical influences; always making sure people “just have a good time”. Several venue owners noticed his talent and as a result of this Rico was soon given opportunities to play for larger crowds, while maintaining a party and ‘feelgood’ atmosphere. Gifted with being able to read his crowds, Rico slowly grew more popular as a DJ. While most DJ’s focus on one genre in particular, Rico has always had a different mentality: “why focus on one thing if you can have it all”. Anything from Reggae to Hardstyle, or R’n'B to House music; he selects his tracks with careful precision, aiming to please the crowd, creating that ‘wow’ effect. Because of his wide musical taste and style, at an early point in his career he had already played with and got in touch with DJ’s like Real El Canario, Sidney Samson, The Partysquad, Jean, 100% Isis, The Flexican and Irwan. As the eclectic music genre became increasingly popular, more and more DJ’s became active in the genre. Rico has always managed to separate himself from others, by playing, what is in essence a medley, creating an energetic, ever evolving and organic set, taking the people on a musical trip through different styles and genres. Internationally, his talent has also been picked up. Since 2007 till date, Rico has been a resident disc jockey during summer at a club in Chersonissos, Greece. In 2012 this led to a new highlight in his career: he became resident dj at Starbeach, Chersonissos, Greece. To even further distinguish his style from other DJ’s he started producing his own tracks and remixes, which are supported by mainstream DJ’s like The Flexican, Real El Canario, The Partysquad and Irwan. This ultimately led to the international support of Grammy winner and DJ/Producer Diplo. Rico is patient and passionate about exploring and playing music in all it’s forms. He is eager to further develop his style, all the while keeping in mind where he once started. The question is: are we defined by what we do, or is what we do defined by who we are?",http://www.ricosouth.com/,"House, Tech House, Progressive House",Netherlands,Dutch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Funktion Recordings, Upland",,,,rico-south/112000,https://www.facebook.com/RicoSouth/,,,,rico-south/,39046:Rico-South,Rico+South,,,@RicoSouth,Ricozzzz

A jung talented artist, who has experienced a lot of what the world has to offer. Born in Delft and Raised in Wateringen, a small village near The Hague (The Netherlands). His first steps into the worldwide Electronic Dance Music scene were when he was 13 years old. He started producing house music and shortly after that he released his first tracks at small labels. From that moment Jimmy directly knew ‘House Music’ was his passion. Some labels were picking up the talent and released some of his tracks at popular labels. In 2011 he made official remixes, for example Kura and also released some original tracks together with Blasterjaxx, Joey Dale and Deorro. The number 1, 3 and 7 spots on Dance-Tunes were the first steps that put his name on the map. At that time, he also received a lot of support from DJ Jean, who supported Jimmy almost every week in his SLAMFM radio show. After many years of producing the highest quality dance music, the nightlife finally waited for him. He performed at outdoor festivals like World of Pleasure, Lief Festival, Brothers Open Air and leading parties like Amsterdam Dance Event. In 2013 and 2014 Jimmy Clash became a resident DJ at award winning venue Brothers Festival Dome, where he spins every month. After giving away free tracks, Jimmy teamed up with Andres Fresko (Miami based DJ) for his first official release called “Drum machine”, that has been released at Fresko’s Hybrid Records.

Artist# 1363,Sebastien Bruce,http://www.sebastienbruce.com/uploads/1/7/7/1/17711019/36240.jpg?205,,"As one of the few DJ's made for sunny open airs as well as late dim dance floors, Sebastien Bruce started spinning when he was only 12 years old. He picked up a habit for life. So it’s save to say he is experienced in setting dance floors on fire. By the time he reached his 20th birthday he had not only played all the essential clubs in Amsterdam, he also was a ‘seen & approved’ deejay in the underground scene. Soon his energetic and exhilarating sets where heard all over the country. There aren’t many festivals, out- or indoor parties which he didn’t please with his presence. As if that wasn’t enough for him, he won the 3rd price at the Dutch Deejay Championship 2001. Meaning the rest of the world became seriously involved too. Gigs in the UK, USA, Germany, France, Italy and Spain (Ibiza) followed. And there isn’t much changed in these last years. Sebastien is still a regular deejay in Ibiza  (Guarana - PK2 - Amnesia - Es Vive - Atzaro - Ushuaia - Private parties). Throwing more oil on the fires they leave him behind, he has proved that he masters the art of climaxing.  Besides the ‘live action’ mentioned above, Sebastian Bruce also translates his musical mania into his own dance productions and his acclaimed sets are broadcasted all over the world. His biggest hit was a remix for DJ Tiesto called Lethal Industry. The record was played by Tiesto, Armin van Buuren, Markus Schulz, Avicii, Glenn Morrison, Christian Smith and David Guetta.  In 2014 Sebastien Bruce hooked up with producer M.I.R.K.O. and together they made their smashhit 40 REBELZ for Spiritual Records. The hypnotic hook will make you dance forever! :)",http://www.sebastienbruce.com/,"Progressive House, House",Netherlands,Dutch,Sebastien Bruce,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spiritual Records, Method, Baroque Digital",,,,sebastien-bruce/246392,,,,,sebastienbruce/,,,sebastienbruce,652jSeK9eemnvmeXzKSsxt,@SebastienBruce,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtQaMJ0dJ4fPF_p9QlJsEzw

Music has been his passion since he was a young child. As a teenager he discovered the ‘power of mixing’ with records such as “Relax” (Frankie Goes to Hollywood) and “High Energy” (Evelyn Thomas). He first took to the decks at school dances in Steenwijk, using his own name. His talent was immediately appreciated and he was offered a gig as resident DJ in the club “Chez Jean” (Steenwijk) at an early age. Offers from other clubs quickly followed suit. Jos became a phenomenon in the area, spinning in clubs such as “Locomotion” (Steenwijk) and “Lord Nelson” (Meppel), on a regular basis. Jos could also be found presenting several different radio shows with the local radio station (SLOS). At 24, he was DJ-ing at “Music hall X-Ray” in Zwolle when a manager decided to enter him in a mixing competition for Dance Update, organized by Alex van Oostrom. As his name Jos Klaster did not exactly capture his groove, he was renamed DJ JOSE, and it is with this name that he became an integral part of the club scene in Holland. He could be found playing in most Dutch clubs and discos, and worked closely with drive-in shows, all of which further expanded his newly found fame. In 1996, Jos became the A&R and product manager for the record label Ala Bianca BLX and Media Records BLX. By 2001 however, the increase in demand for Jose was overwhelming, and he quit the record label to continue working as a full-time DJ. Jose is in high demand internationally, having played in Turkey, Albania, Greece and Israel. He is still actively DJ-ing in Spain, Norway, Poland, Russia and the Dutch Antilles. Jose is no stranger to events such as Mysteryland, Dance Valley, Free Festival and Trance Energy, and he is a resident DJ at Exceptionnel, Filemon in Utrecht, Peppermint Club on Tour, Ibiza Catamaran Parties and AMS2IBZ.",www.djjose.com ,House,"Almere, Netherlands",Dutch,Jos Klaster,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Spinning, Work",,,,dj-jose/18465,https://www.facebook.com/djjoseholland?_rdr=p,,dj-jose/id60284644,Dj+Jose,JOSE-Holland/,52:Jose,52166-dj-jose,djjoseholland,,@DJJoseHolland,djjosemusic

Since then they have been playing on several parties and festivals and not to forget their debut mini-tour through Indonesia. Sharing stages with other Dj’s and live-acts like Mightyfools, NT89, TWR72, Nobody Beats The Drum, Boemklatsch, Dem Slackers, Larry Tee, Skitzofrenix, Henzel and Disco Nova, Wannabe a star and many more. STICKYFINGERS is known for their active and vivid stage performances, as they like to party as hard as the crowd does. They have a particular taste when it comes to the electronic sound the brothers are so passionate about. This particular taste always results in surprising and refreshing sets full of musical outbursts and climaxing crowds!

As a result, he grew up with an intense love for music and in 1998 became a resident DJ at one of the most famous techno clubs in Germany - The Palazzo. As his career progressed successfully, in 2002 he also started his own party series – “Tanz Der Familie”. Around this same time period (together with Udo Niebergall) Eric founded the Masters Of Disaster and Beatdisaster record labels. These featured influential releases from artists, such as - Gayle San, The Advent, Chris Liebing, Hertz, Rush, etc - and were also a platform for Eric’s own releases. In 2003 the worldwide club hit “Ciao Bella” and the German chart hit “Tube Tech - The End” were released to massive acclaim. With his unique performances on the E-drums during his DJ sets, Eric swiftly developed into a distinctive and highly sought after international player. After he presented his unique “Art of Life” show at the Nature One Festival (2009) for the first time, he gained rave reviews throughout an exclusive festival tour of the show in the summer 2010 and 2011. By incorporating the playing of live instruments into his DJ sets, he is an unforgettable performer. Eric can combine his trademark groovy technoid DJ style with his live performance of a range of acoustic and electronic instruments, including E-Drums, E-accordion, percussion & didgeridoo. In 2011 he launched his new Mudra Audio label, where he released his critically acclaimed album “Polarity” in March 2012. Supported by international artists like Laurent Garnier, Len Faki, Dubfire, Christian Varela, Marco Bailey, Luciano, Gabriel Ananda and Cari Lekebusch, the album was highly successful, so much so much so, that Umek signed the album track “Shut Up & Dance” as a single for his 1605 label, which was released in August 2012. Over the past two years, Eric has continued to increase his profile as an international artist, with and amazing flow of releases on some of the world’s most exciting techno labels, such as – 1605, Tronic, MB Elektronics, Phobiq, Agile, Evolution and Transmit. Rarely does a week go by without an Eric Sneo release appearing in the Beatport Techno Top 100.  With his successful “Move On” EP, he became a member of Christian Smith’s respected, forward-thinking Tronic family, a move that has now led to him unveiling his masterful, new “Intensity” album project for the label. Set for release in for the summer of 2014, this is Eric’s 5th album of his career and is a complete lesson in the creation of exhilarating techno that will set any dance-floor on fire, showing that the future of exciting techno music is in safe hands.",https://www.facebook.com/EricSneo/info/www.ericsneo.com,Techno,"Mainz, Germany",German,Eric Sneo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Beatdisaster, Mudra Audio",EricSneo,,ericsneo,eric-sneo/5470,https://www.facebook.com/EricSneo,,eric-sneo/id42237986,Eric+Sneo,ericsneo3/,8441:Eric-Sneo,32753-eric-sneo,ericsneo,4YcZ1IyKQ4egHqSNVoZbKT,@EricSneoOFC,sneoeric

In venues such as, Space Ibiza,  Arena Club Berlin, Rex Paris, Moog Barcelona, Hyte Amsterdam, NATURE ONE and MAYDAY, Dortmund to name a few, the Argentinian´s definition of techno has been clearly demonstrated not only through his DJ sets that are as devastating as they are uplifting with his serious kick drums, use of hi-hats and reverberating basslines, but also through driving his own organically produced techno forward with an EP released on CLR - 'Sincrodestino', and remixes for SOMA - Slam Reverse Proceed Remixes, only to scratch the surface, cutting his industrially chizzled sound with melodical rythms both elegant and almost eloquent in nature. His music is now recognised and played worldwide having artists such as, Chris Liebing, Adam Beyer, Len Faki, Dave Clark, Ben Sims, Speedy J, DVS1, Pfirter and Joseph Cappriati, among many others, as supporters of his work. Flug´s unrivaled and brutal self-discipline in the studio, his humbleness in approach, his fierce passion for and overall dedication to the cause,  as well as having grown up living and breathing electronic music, have given Flug, real name Sebastian, a long and welcoming insight into what it really means to be a DJ and producer in today's techno world, which in his opinion, means keeping it real.",http://www.flugmusik.com/,Techno,"Barcelona, Spain",Argentine,Sebastian Lopez,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sleaze Records, MindTrip Music",,,,flug/39421,https://www.facebook.com/flugofficial,flugofficial,,Flug,Flug/,83179:Flug,,flug,3sMtPWvoIoTE1IR3Ehdf5m,@flugofficial,

Hackler & Kuch, real names Bo Andrée and Ernst vd Berg, started their career in 2009 as Dj’s. In 2010 they started their ‘Hackler & Kuch’ project in which they moved their focus towards peak time techno. By the end of 2010 they had their first works ready and In 2011 they released on platforms such as Ireland/Germany based Gobsmacked Records and UK based Transmissions. Their first full album ‘Beethoven was deaf too!’ was released at US based Machine Box Records. After that they quickly made their way to other labels such as Rome’s The-Zone Records, where they released their well-received Duck & Cover EP, which included remixes from Austria’s Niereich, Italy’s Logotech and Germany based Cortechs. It was during the setup of this album that they got to know Niereich better, which proved to be a fruitful musical relationship. Shortly after, they released the Trans Lunar Injection EP together with him, which stayed in the Beatport top 100 techno for over a month. End 2011, Hackler & Kuch had their works released at big labels like Nachtstrom Schallplatten, TK Records, Construct Rhythm and The-Zone. The 2011 icon track Bombing Lessons on Torsten Kanzler’s TK records shook the underground techno scene and is still found in many sets across the techno scene, including ones played at big events like Mayday. The Fallout EP in 2012 with Niereich, which was released as a vinyl on Construct Rhythm, was quick to sell out and again was again played on big events such as Nature One, Toxicator and Mayday. The 2012 highlight was the set on Friday night main stage at Fusion Festival, a festival that is known all over the world as one of the best musical experiences within the electronic genre. End of 2012 Hackler & Kuch started their sell out Meltdown events, where they invited their friends like Industrialyzer, David Moleon and Axel Karakasis to play. In 2013, Hackler & Kuch joined forces with one of the most well-known German artist agencies: Abstract, and will be working on a lot of projects together with Niereich. At the moment Hackler & Kuch have gigs scheduled in the major German Techno clubs like Lehmann club and Butan. Furthermore you can expect to see them play as Niereich vs. Hackler & Kuch on events like Mayday and Abstract Nights.",http://www.hacklerkuch.com/,Techno,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",Dutch,Bo Andree,Ernst van den Berg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Natchstrom Schallplatten, Mekanism Records",HacklerAndKuch,,,hackler-and-kuch/181331,https://www.facebook.com/hacklerandkuch,,hackler-kuch/id421604678,Hackler+&+Kuch,hackler-kuch/,60243:Hackler-and-Kuch,,hackler-kuch,,,

Today, some years later, she has not only inspired some guys with home booth architecture, but also provided sore leg muscles for many party freaks. In recent years her reputation as insatiable sound machine has grown continuously and an outstanding club history and large fan base have been established. From Berlin over Frankfurt, Ibiza over Hongkong; the live wire behind the decks is well-known in hot spotted techno clubs for special marathon sets up to 16 hours, but also on festivals like Nature One, Mayday, Winterworld, Soundtropolis, Syndicate, Echolot Festival, Ruhr in Love or Loveparade. The ingredients of Kerstins dark powerful sound are straight techno rhythms with fat dirty bass-lines, often peppered with outstanding synth sequences or hypnotic tribal elements. You can actually see and hear her passion for music, when you experience how she infects the party crowd with one of her long mixing sessions – which has always a surprise to hold. Living a nerds life she´s spending most of her time in studio with producing sessions. After years of learning she finally started releasing tracks & remixes 2012 and has signed on Naked Lunch Recordings, Heavy Snatch Records, Citylife Records",http://www.abstract-online.de/de/artists/kerstin-eden,Techno,"Frankfurt, Germany",German,Kerstin Eden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Naked Lunch, Heavy Snatch Records",KerstinEden,,kerstineden,kerstin-eden/327039,https://www.facebook.com/kerstineden,kerstineden,kerstin-eden/id631768618,Kerstin+Eden,Kerstin+Eden,65475:Kerstin-Eden,,kerstineden,3RgxaQ5pM2rSHPu9KqMJ9r,@kerstineden,kerstineden

One could call Sven Wittekind being simply sick, weird & rough. Because not only does his own label bear this concise and suitable name, but these three attributes reflect upon his entire carrier to the dot up to now. Wittekind does not favour superfluous vanities. He rather listens to his heart - and this already since 1999. His passion for music was first expressed in 2002 with „braindead“ on overdrive. Two years later one of his most important releases „Headnut Ep“ on Kne‘Deep was published. In 2004 he became on of the most sought after protagonists of the electronic music scene by founding „Inflicted“. Both as a DJ and Producer Sven Wittekind moves at the pulse of time and already surpassed at that time all social limits and and norms. He rather sets accents and undoubtedly stands for development and progress of hard techno. His remix of DJ Rushs „Get On Up“ on T:Classix classic was chosen to be the best of the year in Raveline Magazine. Industrial sound coupled with grooving basslines – were developed from set to set from that time onwards. In 2009 reinvented his present homebase Sick Weird & Rough – based upon which, he published last year his third artist-album. None of his releases reflect a more personal touch as on „Broken Mirrors“. A snapshot os his life – shaped with music full of basses and space - just the way an artist can expresses himself at best. Sven Wittekind was on tour for the entire year – bevor he retired into his studio at the end of the year. Events he experienced should remain unsung as a memory. A fourth studio-album is planned in Frankfurt in March of this year. If he weaves his common thread of the past one and a half decades further, he will reinvent himself and is going to surprise many dancefloors of this word.

Born in Wernigerode, raised in Sprötau. My life and my first contact with music began in Thüringen. Bands such as Depeche Mode, Tocotronic or Technotronic influenced my increasing addiction to electronic music. At an early age, I already had a growing desire to go to parties, to techno parties, and to party. Djs like Sven Väth, Daz Sound, and Pierre put me under their spell. Thus the madness begun. I got myself belt driven Reloop turntables and a mixer to lay the foundation. The weekend consisted of parties and in between I conducted hours of mix sessions on my turntables at home. I had about 10-15 friends at that time, all of whom were subjected to these marathon sets in my flat. Another cornerstone of my career occurred in 1998. Marco Remus and his booking agency came into my life, and I worked there as the booking agent until 2003. Moving to Berlin in 2001 meant that I was at important events like Berlin's Love Parade, the Sonne Mond Sterne festival and Time Warp as well as becoming better known in Berlin's legendary Tresor Club or the Kassel Stammheim. My fan base grew and grew. Also, in 2001 came my first platform for my own releases on the label Nerven Records. I allowed myself to get carried away not only with stomping and oblique techno. Labels like Stigmata and CLR and artists like Robert Natus and Sven Wittekind also influenced my sets. So that I could further develop along with my art, I founded the Killaz imprint in 2003. The launch of the new label was the Maxi „Chegados“ from the Brazilian DJ-team Pet Duo. I was able to develop freely and to live out my own ideas of techno while making them accessible to the scene. Then, finally in 2005 came a few single releases. „Der Kanzler Kommt“ was the album debut on Nerven Records. About 12 months later „Die Große Koalition“ followed, this time on the Killaz label, uniting almost all renowned hard techno artists on two records. Almost a year later and after numerous single releases on other labels, the second solo album „Der Kanzler Kommt Wieder“, was also released on Killaz. After more than three years of label work it was time for „Best of Killaz“, a mixed cross-section of the previously published releases. The public response to the label grew throughout this time. The Killaz mask helped me to meet fans around the world. To satisfy my addiction to weird sounds, in 2005 I founded the sublabel Error Records. The same year Serial Killaz was born. The Killaz sublabel devoted itself exclusively to the release of qualitative and straightforward techno sets from the biggest artists of the hard techno scene. Dance with the Devilz is another project that I have brought to life with my friend and colleague Frank Kvitta. We play for 4 hours on 4 turntables and 4 cd players. This project has only made rare appearances on special occasions. In 2005, I started our own label nights at the Berlin Rotor Club. At the end of 2006 I got the opportunity to organize Kanzler nights at the world-renowned Tresor club. Meanwhile, these nights became as legendary as the club where they took place. In 2007, I came under the exclusive management of Abstract, the largest, best known, and most successful hard techno agency, led by Sven Schaller. Abstract is responsible for my appearances at Nature One, Syndicate, Dance Valley, Montagood Festival and the Decibel festival. 2009 also brought many great things. The Mayday gig in Dortmund was just the beginning. The first EP on Abstract an EP vs. Sven Wittekind on TKR 01 in September 2009 and an end of the year gig again at Mayday in Poland were just a few of the highlights of last year.",www.torstenkanzler.de ,Techno,"Berlin, Germany",German,Torsten Kanzler,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TK Records,TorstenKanzler,,,torsten-kanzler/11247,https://www.facebook.com/TorstenKanzler,torstenkanzler,torsten-kanzler/id158581001,Torsten+Kanzler,torsten-kanzler/,15505:Torsten-Kanzler,,torstenkanzler,6ivd3NhMvn9EIN64Q3lqik,,TorstenKanzler

Being brought up in Amsterdam, YAX.X cut his teeth with vinyl from the age of 14 playing Hip Hop, House and Electro. His insatiable desire to spin records saw him play in just about every venue in Amsterdam and learn the art of reading a dance floor and delivering the goods. As his musical direction evolved he found himself playing House, but he still maintains his sharp ear for a groove or hook that entertains the floor. From the smoothest house beats to epic EDM sounds or the thump of an electro banger, YAXX is well versed and ready to deliver.  In the last year, YAXX has taken his first steps into the European DJ circuit with debut gigs in Barcelona, Valencia, Hongkong, Shanghai as well as Ibiza with gigs in Pacha, Privilege and Blue Marlin. YAX.X is also a prolific producer and remixer and has just released “LOVIN U” on Pacha Recordings and has much more to come!

His interest in music started at a very young age; Tom was fascinated by rock music and started his very own rock band together with a group of friends when he was just 14. Jamming on the guitar was a daily escape and only fuelled his passion further. At the age of 17, he discovered electronic dance music and was inspired by artists such as Deadmau5 and Daft Punk. Over the next few years, Tom taught himself the art of DJing, gradually improving through constant practice and flexing his mixing skills at a local club between school and at weekends. Once he had perfected these DJ skills, he saved up his earnings and bought a proper DJ setup, transforming himself from a bedroom DJ into an artist with an unrivalled drive for music production. Within 6 months Tom had created his first bootlegs and unofficial remixes in his makeshift studio. These quickly received solid support from respected artists such as Nervo, Gareth Emery and Laidback Luke. His bootleg of David Guetta & Avicii vs. Laidback Luke – Till Sunshine, which was released under his moniker Pixel Cheese, topped over 15 million views on YouTube and instantly became one of the most successful bootlegs ever produced to date. Following this success, at the end of 2011, his first official remix of Gareth Emery’s single “Tokyo” was released on Garuda and immediately climbed into Beatport’s Top 100 chart. This remix was followed by two other successful remixes for Steve Aoki and Kaskade, two of the pillars of modern electronic dance music. Tom was now on a journey towards his first single release and in March 2012, his debut track “Elva” went out on Ultra Records. “Elva” received support from the likes of Tiësto and kick-started Tom’s career, which was followed by his first European tour.  Two month’s later Tom remixed “Nervo’s - You’re Gonna Love Again” on EMI, his last release under the alias Pixel Cheese. From this moment onwards Tom Swoon embarked on a sensational rollercoaster of a year, releasing his second single “Who We Are” feat. Miss Palmer and more A-list remixes for Alex Gaudino, Flo Rida, Jennifer Lopez, Ellie Goulding, Drumsound & Bassline Smith and Topher Jones.  Securing over twenty tour dates in his debut year to compliment his original releases and remixes, Tom Swoon ended the year warming up for Avicii on his concert tour and on a tour of India with Steve Aoki. Nominated by Nervo as their ‘Breakthrough Artist DJ for 2012’, and voted as the “Polish Breakthrough DJ of the Year” by FTB Poland, Tom was also mentioned in both MixMag and Billboard magazine as their ‘Artist to Watch’ for 2013.  The year to come would live up to its billing, with his remix of “Bloody Beetroots - Chronicles Of A Fallen Love” demonstrating the reason for such acclaim. This remix instantly became a dance floor favourite and was supported by the likes of David Guetta, Avicii, Arty, Thomas Gold, Steve Angello and many others. A string of high profile remixes for Dido, Steve Aoki, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Flo Rida, Tara McDonald, Paul Oakenfold and Gareth Emery followed over the next 12 weeks giving Tom the much deserved credibility in the scene. The much awaited collaboration with Amba Shepherd titled “Not Too Late” followed with an interesting remix package by Bassnectar & Patrick Reza, Maor Levi, Sebjak and Josef Belani. “Not Too Late” also premiered Tom’s first official music video, which was shot and produced in Tokyo, Japan. The success of the single continued with the music video being premiered on music channel MTV US and a strong presence in the dance charts leading into the summer. Having successfully become the remixer of choice with his new fresh-sounding remixes and his big room approach, Tom was called in for another set of remixes for Nervo, Sultan & Ned Shepard’s single “Army” and Benny Benassi’s collaboration with John Legend called “Dance The Pain Away”. In between such duties Tom’s fourth single “Wings”, was released in July and received massive support from a variety of dance music icons with the remix by Myon & Shane 54 topping the Beatport trance chart at the number 1 position for several weeks.  In the third quarter of 2013, Tom Swoon released another great collaboration titled “Rollercoaster”, an instrumental inspired by his fast paced rise to EDM stardom, together with rising star, Josef Belani. On a non-stop mission to deliver the very best, Tom Swoon made headlines in the world press with his remix for one of the most successful rock bands of all-time; Linkin Park. This track was included in Linkin Park’s album “Recharged” which was released worldwide on October 29th.  Come December 2013, Tom Swoon launched his very own weekly radio show and podcast. LIFT OFF Radio is broadcast on several international FM/Digital radio stations including Radio FG Mexico and Poland’s No.1 radio station, RMF Maxx, giving his fans their weekly dose of music, as well as through iTunes and Soundcloud. At the tail end of 2013, Tom Swoon released his chart topping “Synchronize”, a collaboration with Paris Blohm and Hadouken!. Whilst gathering major pre-release support from Martin Garrix, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Dyro, W&W, Dubvision, Max Vangeli, MYNC, Deniz Koyu and many others, it also hit the #12 position on Beatport progressive charts and hovered for over a month on the top #20, clearly outlining Tom’s achievements and the increased demand for new music by his ever-growing fan base.  2013 was an incredible year for Tom Swoon, with a strong array of remixes and an ever growing presence in the top chart positions with his singles and collaborations. This was strengthened by a full tour diary comprising of over 60 shows and including headline shows at Creamfields Festival, Sunrise Festival and Ushuaia Ibiza, whilst maintaining a constant presence on the club circuit with the likes of New City Gas, Ministry Of Sound, Pacha NYC, Gatecrasher and Avalon requiring his services. 2014 is set to be another stratospheric year for Tom Swoon with more shows, more releases and even more big name collaborations. His achievements of the past few years show that this is an artist that is definitely worth watching.",http://www.tomswoon.com/,Electronic,Poland,Polish,Dorian Tomasiak,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ultra, Armada Music Bundle, Zouk Recordings",TomSwoon,,,tom-swoon/294939,https://www.facebook.com/TomSwoon,tomswoon,tom-swoon/id571730590?ign-mpt=uo%3D4,Tom+Swoon,tom-swoon/,72920:Tom-Swoon,5884204-tom-swoon,tomswoon,2OFEXARoSZyZLR6S0oV2R7,@TomSwoon,tomswoon

Quite an induction, but not a wholly unexpected one when you consider the technical ability of this gifted producer who had spent the last few years honing his skills on the studio desk. “Keep On” a collaboration with Jordan Peak on Area Remote later that year and then his own “Sacrifice” on Saved Records in 2012 brought further success and garnered Mark wide critical acclaim and a helped yield a particularly strong fan base for a young producer with relatively few releases. But Mark has always been someone who focuses on quality ahead of quantity. “Cutoff” which was released via Leena Music and 2013’s “Game Plan” on Saved Records confirmed his much deserved status as one of the scene’s most exciting producers whose ability enables him to craft tracks across the entire spectrum of electronic music. That same attitude also comes into play during Mark’s engaging DJ sets. A desire to play across the board and create a proper journey for the crowd has made Mark an extremely popular performer at the best clubs and festivals around the world. He is as adept at killing the floor at clubs like El Row in Barcelona, Amsterdam’s Studio 80, Space in Ibiza and Ministry of Sound in London as he is rocking festivals such as Sonar, WMC and the roadblock Saved events in his hometown of Maidstone. Having achieved so much already and still only at the age of 26, Mark has a bright future ahead of him. With his skill set and self-drive all at his disposal, he holds all the cards, it’s just up to him in which direction he will head next.",http://www.markfanciulli.com/,"House, Tech House, Techno","Maidstone, United Kingdom",British,Mark Fanciulli,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Saved Records, Rejected",,,markfanciulli,mark-fanciulli/190671,https://www.facebook.com/markfanciullidj/timeline/,,mark-fanciulli/id439135583,Mark+Fanciulli,mark-fanciulli/,63712:Mark-Fanciulli,,markfanciulli,55bW30FxVwAhkwQmt7A7ZZ,@markfanciulli,

Sebo K launched his DJ career in early-90s Berlin, as an integral member of Alec Empire’s Bass Terror, the city’s first UK-style drum & bass and breakbeat club nights. By the middle of the decade Sebo K had fallen under the spell of stateside artists like DJ Sneak, Boo Williams and Mood II Swing, and his growing love for Chicago and NYC House and Detroit techno began to reveal itself within his club appearances throughout the city. Sebo K has been a resident DJ for internationally renowned Berlin club Watergate since 2002. Through his own ‘SCENARIO’ nights that take place in clubs all over Europe, his relentless international touring schedule, and with mobilee’s Back Up Vol. 1 and Watergate’s 04 mixes to his credit, a growing legion of fans both close to home and further afield has been captivated by his unique mix of the old and the new. Despite a relatively limited discography of original productions, quality over quantity has always been the credo for Sebo K. His releases for Mobilee Records like “Moved” feat. Prosumer or “Rancho Relaxo”, the instant classic collaboration with Anja Schneider established Sebo K as the up-and-comer worthy of close attention, further cemented by his breakout hits “Diva” on Mobilee , and “Saxtrack” for Cecille. Alongside his timeless original productions, Sebo K has remixed some of the most respected artists on the planet, including Nina Kraviz, Radio Slave, Martyn and Efdemin. Effortlessly transitioning from deep soulfulness, to tough stripped-down sounds, and back again, Sebo K has reinforced the enduring importance of house music throughout the perpetual cycles of trends, and this ability to command a club crowd has been equaled by his exceptional productions.",,"House, Techno","Berlin, Germany",German,Sebastian Kloft,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scenario,SeboK,,,sebo-k/10556,https://www.facebook.com/djsebok,,sebo-k/id261178245,Sebo+K,sebo-k/,32975:Sebo-K,586890-sebo-k,sebo-k,0C12lVN0om5RjpgjboPnf3,,

They are known as Livio & Roby and they have been putting their own supernatural twist on house and techno for the past 10 years. Their connection with the global electronic music movement has been channeled via highly influential outlets such as Desolat, VIVa, Saved and Fumakilla. While their physical presence has been felt in a myriad of venues from Buenos Aires to Detroit, and across much of Europe. From dynamic DJ sets and innovative live performances to album projects and a constant flow of cutting edge, dancefloor-based productions the duo remain one of their nation's leading lights in the field. Livio & Roby were born from the weeping souls of their ancestors, men and women who lived through centuries of struggle, from the poverty of the Middle Ages to the Communist rule that only recently lost its grip on the nation. It was only through the determination of a small percentage of brave individuals that it was still possible to hear music from overseas, in the most clandestine of situations – the true meaning of underground. Music found its way, against all odds. Romania's spirit is evident in all aspects of their music; The tribal rhythms penetrate your psyche, the organic instrumentation lifts your spirit; flutes and vocals combine with delicate chimes, while groovy basslines and solemn melodies create a magical concoction. It's a formula that caught the ears of their early supporters, Steve Lawler signed them up to VIVa Music and Berlin stalwart Woody introduced them to the city's music scene via his highly-respected Fumakilla label.  These early connections helped to spread Livio & Roby's unique blueprint throughout Europe, enchanting more and more influential figures. Next to fall under their spell was Loco Dice, who signed them to his Artist Alife agency and promptly released the seminal 'Mistique' – a track created in collaboration with the third member of this spellbinding outfit, George G, with whom they form Premiesku. Just like their unique partnership, Premiesku operates within its own confines – their live show is built around hardware that has been customised and reconfigured for their own use, without any computers involved. This gives them total freedom in their performances and allows them to express their own distinctive style. Thanks to the consistenly high quality of their output, Livio & Roby have been in constant demand around the globe, sharing the spirit of Romania with the clientele of clubs and festivals across North and South America, Europe and further afield. Today, their endless travels continue, as does their entrancing musical output, from EPs with labels such as Vakant and Cecille Numbers through to their debut Premiesku album, 'Indirect', which came via Desolat. 2014 will see further adventures around the planet, Premiesku reform with new music and hit the road with their dazzling live act. Livio & Roby release their own album marking the next stage in their careers and the story continues as the duo continue to innovate and carry on the legacy of their ancestors.",http://www.livio-roby.com/,House,"Bucharest, Romania",Romanian,Robert Precup,Silviu Sandu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Desolat, Vakant, Saved, VIVa MUSiC, Cecille, Fumakilla",,,,livio-and-roby/8201,https://www.facebook.com/livioroby,livioandroby,livio-roby/id83122793?ign-mpt=uo%3D4,Livio+&+Roby,livio-roby/,49153:Livio-and-Roby,602974-livio-and-roby,livio-roby,3iDCbcQti4beq3r7SuwpIs,@LivioRoby,

He was often in clubs until the early hours of the morning and found his way to electronic music. In 2001 he bought his first turntables and mixer. In the attic of his parents he built a small studio and recorded his first set with a tape recorder. He devoted himself to the minimalist bar, which is still reflected in his subbasspressenden tracks. He started off with small performances and 2 years later performed as DJ-synonym “Jason”Wawn” in Rostock, Neubrandenburg clubs and open airs in Pütnitz. His first major highlight in his career was the Open Air “Pütnitz wakes up” in line up with known International and National artists such is Troy Pierce, Dapayk, Heartthrob and Tommy Gun. 5 years ago, Carlo started producing his own tracks, inspired by artists such as Heinrichs & Hirtenfellner, Daniel Steinberg and Magda. Since 2010 “Jason Wawn” has been perfoming under his real name Carlo Ruetz. Driven by his ambition to produce successful tracks he already had his first debut success with” I`m Fucking Famous”. With the “Handmade ep” supported by Alfred Heinrichs he released the first time on his homebase-label „Supdub“. More releases followed till march 2013 where Carlo Ruetz has released his first album, called „Breakthrough“ on „Supdub Digitales“. The name was also its attention: Though within 24hrs after release the album crashed into the minimal beatportcharts and asserted itself on the pole-position for more than three weeks. Amongst other great productions this was the reason for an invitation for playing at Richie Hawtin´s ENTER. parties in Rummelsburg/Berlin and the legendary Space-Club in Ibiza last summer. Since this happenings Carlo Ruetz already played at several Minus-Showcases. Richie Hawtin himself counts Carlo Ruetz to the new minus-generation. His first EP for Minus will be released in the end of july.

The electronic music scene has surrendered to Coyu’s constantly outstanding efforts. What began as a dream is now becoming a reality. His studio skills are ever more in demand. The impact of his remix of the Fatboy Slim‘s classic “Right Here Right Now” has been huge (#1 Tech House on Beatport). While his X-Press 2 “Muzik Xpress” remix became massive floor filler as well. Releases on Cocoon, Get Physical, Noir Music, 100% Pure, Tronic or his own Suara plus being one of the most charted artists of Resident Advisor's history has put Coyu on the map as one of the best producers of the moment.

Both originally coming from a non-electronic background with Jakob starting out playing bass guitar both in Hardcore as well as Jazz and Funk bands whilst Franziskus mastering classical piano lessons soon they were infested by the seductive virus named electronic music in the early and mid 90s. This newly found fascination for a completely different musical environment led the Berlin-based Jacob into his first production efforts with an Atari ST40 + synthesizer set-up whilst Franziskus stepped into the DJ-booth of several clubs of his former East German hometown of Erfurt. Backed by a history like this their paths finally crossed at Berlin's school of audio engineering (SAE), where both of them studied to become sound engineers. Soon their shared love of all things electronic music related was unveiled and after immersing themselves in the cities praised, flourishing nightlife as well as some shared studio time things started to fall into place for them, resulting in a project now known as Format: B which has become one of Germany's most successful electronic acts of the past few years due to a steady string of releases, unique musical vision and an impressive level of consistency provided in the ongoing evolution and progression of their signature MotorFunk sound. From their early works on Highgrade Recordings, Stil Vor Talent or Opossum Recordings including the massive hit „Vivian Wheeler“ via remix works for acclaimed artists like Sébastien Léger, Paul Kalkbrenner, Oliver Koletzki, DJ Madskillz to their groundbreaking 2008 album debut „Steam Circuit“ once again featuring a massive dancefloor smash named „Edding 500“ the Format: B trademark was all over the place and the pair of producers soon found themselves touring the globe, playing Australia, Asia, the US and South America and – of course – Europe where the Berlin-based Watergate Club turned out to be a firm homebase for Format: B throughout the years. Inspired by their skyrocketing success 2009 saw the next logical step in the history of Format: B when the duo teamed up with label manager Hawks Grunert to install their own imprint Formatik Records which has been the exclusive home to all Format: B releases ever since, for their critically acclaimed, forward-thinking sophomore album „Restless“ followed by a triplet of remix singles as well as a string of successful EP's. Taking on the challenge of running a label has not only greatly helped to shape and define the Format: B identity and brand on a global scale but also enabled them to prove A&R abilities beyond production skills with a series of signings from their ever expanding network including fellow Berliners Daniel Steinberg and Pan-Pot, Amsterdam's Sebastien Leger and DJ Madskillz, Italy's Uto Karem and Hugo or the new talent Tobi Kramer who has been making some waves with his label debut lately. This impressive artist roster combined with a strong visual identity and Format: B's impellent MotorFunk-sound usually being on the more technoid side of TechHouse and sporting heavy basslines alongside a supersolid foundation of bassdrums has turned Formatik Records into one of the scenes leading electronic imprints of this time, spearheaded by one of the most successful electronic duos of today that has still a lot more in store for its global fanbase.",http://www.formatb.com/,"House, Techno","Berlin, Germany",German,Franziskus Sell,Jakob Hildenbrand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Formatik Records,Format:B?came_from=198,,,format:b/17248,https://www.facebook.com/FORMATBofficial/timeline/,,format-b/id265715622,Format:B,formatb/,45983:Format-B,671485-formatb,,5Am25tT39BPzreHngMkuux,@FormatBmusic,

Images of cold storage warehouses, desolate heavy plant sites and bluish flesh are not entirely misplaced. Shards of German Engineering glimmer in his music, laced with persuasive logic, gruesome Darwinism. What remains: what works. Whilst hordes of German producers and DJs set their satnavs for Berlin, Oliver Huntemann chose to head back home. His epicenter is, and will remain, the north. Hamburg, to be exact. This is where he produces his music and it is from here that he sets out into the world, thrilling the populous with his DJ sets. Oliver Huntemann’s concrete roots can be traced back to early techno. Had he been any younger, he would undoubtedly have sucked electronica like mother’s milk from a C64 chip. Like so many of his colleagues, his route to techno took a tour through electro and rave. He could tell the usual veteran tales when it comes to influences, his first record purchases, or on the subject of the good old days. Been there, done that! It was more difficult maintaining a low profile.  Since 2008 Huntemann has been running the Ideal Audio label. A new chapter after more than fifteen years Confused Recordings plus a host of sub and sister labels. As well as numerous 12 inches and almost as many remixes (for Underworld, Chemical Brothers and Depeche Mode, to name just a few), he released his third album, “H-3“ in 2009 to critical acclaim on Ideal Audio. Oliver’s expertly constructed productions quickly gained him countless admirers within the techno-elite, and it wasn’t long before he struck up a devastating partnership with Dubfire. In 2008 the pair released the awesome ‘Dios’ which was followed last year with the first part of their ‘Elements’ series: ‘Terra' and ‘Fuego’. The highly-anticipated next installment of the ‘Elements’ series is scheduled for release later in 2012 and initial reactions indicate that 'Aqua' and ‘Aire’ are set to be just as big as the duo’s earlier productions. In November 2011, Oliver released his second artist album entitled “Paranoia”. Maintaining the lofty standards already set by his previous musical output, Paranoia, received glowing reviews across the board and further cemented Oliver’s position as one of techno’s most sought-after artists. Furthermore, with guest vocals from the world-famous and highly sought-after American Robert Owens in addition to the supremely talented Danish singer Ane Trolle, Paranoia demonstrated Oliver’s enduring skill and versatility as a producer.  Now for 2012, Oliver is lining up the latest instalment of the hugely successful PLAY! Series which is preceded by a new EP release aptly entitled ""PLAY! 04 EP – Tasmanian Tiger / Melbourne"". Oliver’s contribution to the mix series follows in the esteemed footsteps of previous PLAY! CDs (D-Edge in Sao Paolo, Rex Club in Paris and Cielo in NYC) and is recorded live from the ‘Roxanne Parlour’ in Melbourne Australia.  Spread over 2CDs, PLAY! 04 relays the natural energy of the dance-floor and the gig, whilst also indicating that the listening experience is in the hands of an artist who has a clear vision for his musical journeys. PLAY! 04 is an accurate representation of the music Oliver is currently playing at his DJ gigs, and the selection reminds us why he has remained relevant for nearly two decades. With so much fame on his plate, he has done remarkably well to stay out of the spotlight. That’s how it is in the north, actions count, not appearances.",http://www.huntemann.tv/,"Techno, Electronic","Hamburg, Germany",German,Oliver Huntemann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Senso Sounds,OliverHuntemann,,,oliver-huntemann/10490,https://www.facebook.com/OliverHuntemannOFC,oliver_huntemann,oliver-huntemann/id82194502?ign-mpt=uo%3D4,Oliver+Huntemann,oliver-huntemann/,23655:Oliver-Huntemann,541462-oliver-huntemann,oliver-huntemann,0NBGssQpgDczTsVEp4pCbR,@OliverHuntemann,extra110

Arado’s adventure begins as such with his debut release in autumn 2009. From Desolat he takes the “Uganda Express” whose Wild-Pitch not only sent him straight on the playlists and charts of major issuing music DJs furthermore it turned out to be an one way ticket to an international DJ career. After a few stopovers on Area Remote, Allin and Dame Music he is headed for Moon Harbor and he shoots again for the stars with „Strange Neighbors“ The scene and press both agree on the fact that house made in Germany has never sounded so mondial like with Arado. This is verified by Arado’s following releases on Cecille, Etruria and Italy’s on the rise label Moan Recordings and Remixes for Pascal FEOS, Martinez, Marco Faraone, Yaya, Tom Flynn, Oliver Klein and Bunte Bummler. Constantly developing grooves and deepness grabbing ahold with artful placed elements of surprise is not only the character of his productions Arado also brings it to the decks. The charismatic DJ from the Rhineland demonstrates this as he tours the world side by side with the leading DJ elite.Once infected with the Arado bug it’s nearly impossible ever to recover. With amazing shows at places where he is known the best are Extrema (BE), Thaibreak, WMC (Miami) and Sonar (Barcelona). At Open Airs such as Kiesgrube (Neuss), Woodstock69 (NL), Pollerwiesen (DE) and on the worlds best party island Ibiza where he plays at Space and Sankeys. You can also find him often at Frankfurts Cocoon Club, Café D’Anvers (NL), Tenax (IT) and in New York. No matter where his journey may take him Arado will never lose sight of his home base the 102 Club in Neuss. His residency allows him on a regular basis back to his native party haven were Arado is well known for celebrating excessive sets way past the crack of dawn.

A Dutch house encyclopedia, that is. After 30 years of spinning records you could call this DJ a true veteran, known for his enormous sensitivity, true feeling and mixing skills. Hardly anybody ever felt and looked so comfortable behind the decks as DJ Dimitri. Ecstasy is no longer just a word, but a true magical moment as the crowd, the surroundings and the music all come together in one hypnotizing state of happiness. This man knows -or should we say feels- what he is doing, not only behind the decks but also when producing his own music. In 1988 Dimitri obtains his first residency at club Richter in Amsterdam and starts spinning in the legendary RoXY, where he distinguishes himself from the rest of the DJ-ing world through his bold and innovative mixing techniques. Dimitri is one of the first DJs to mix a house record with breakbeats or drum ‘n bass, proving he is not only capable of mixing those two records together by tempo and rhythm , but also just by melody or tune/pitch, creating real-time compositions. At that time this was really groundbreaking. A style that has been copied ever so often, although never truly coming close to the master himself. By 1991 Dimitri spins at all the major (warehouse) parties in the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy. He brings out his first record and starts his own label B.E.S.T. (Beautiful Soul Techno). From 1992 onwards he continues to take over the club world with gigs from Brussels to NYC and from Paris to Detroit – Derrick May becomes a close friend – and starts his famous ‘Hi-Tech Soul Movement’ club night in RoXY on Thursday nights. People from all over the country come to check out his distinctive taste of records and to hear his ‘no concessions policy’ when choosing music, in which many consider him still truly authentic. Dimitri has always had a mind of his own. In the summer of 2007 he decides to take a sabbatical, after having played for 23 years in a row. He trades the club scene for a farm in the north of Holland, while taking care of mentally disabled kids on a voluntary basis. In the meantime he still keeps himself up to date with the latest releases. After a 3 years time-out he feels it is time to get back to his fans. He celebrates his comeback on June 16 2010 at club Trouw in Amsterdam, the start of a residency at one of the best dance venues in Europe. He owns this to the fact that he bridges the gap between the first and second generation of dance adepts, combining in his sets only the most remarkable classics with the cutting-edge sounds of today. His all nighters are truly highly anticipated events. Famous festivals like Awakenings, Loveland and Mysteryland are still happy to add him to their line-ups. And last but not least: he releases his first EP on Planet E, with remixes by Carl Craig and Orlando Voorn. Things keep on working out pretty well until January 2013. Due to a bacterial infection Dimitri finds himself in a university hospital, his life hanging by a thread. But he is determined to fight back. His recovery amazes even the most experienced surgeons – he lost his lower right leg though – and in just 5 months time he is back on track. His new prothesis and his fitness regime enable him to stand on his ‘feet’ again, maybe stronger than ever. September 7 2013 will always be remembered as Dimitri’s second comeback at Trouw. That night he takes the crowd on a very personal journey, getting rid of all the anxiety and pain of the previous months. And most of all: proving that music has the power to heal, one of his strong inner beliefs. In the near future Dimitri will go on spinning records all over Europe and hopefully the rest of the world. Mysteryland USA (Woodstock, USA) will be his first big appearance abroad after his illness.  Producing and mixing music will become more and more part of his 'core business'. Having released another EP on Planet E Communications and tracks on Manual and Deploy Records, Dimitri is currently working on his debut album together with composer/producer Boy Bianchi. Album will be released in 2015. And good news for - young - talent: in the summer of 2014 he will start teaching at the School of House in Amsterdam, giving master classes to anyone with a heart for playing or producing electronic music.

For over more then two! decades he has championed the best the genre has to o!er through his own tight DJ sets, radio shows, productions and, of course, courtesy of his own labels including HEY! and the late EC Records. With his talent as a producer, skills behind the decks and a variety of di!erent genres, Michel opened the door to techno and tech house for a major crowd of lovers throughout these almost 30 years. And he still does today. He succeeded to get a solid reputation abroad through his excellent DJ performances at clubs, parties and festival events across the globe! Together with his ever so popular radio show HEY!Muzik which by now is broadcasted in more then 10 countries. Over the years Michel has picked up a number of awards for his contribution to the scene, as well as the odd US Billboard Dance Chart hit early in his career. Meanwhile, the tech house, techno and minimal music he has released on his own labels has been honoured by modern day talents like Josh Wink, Adam Beyer and Paul Kalkbrenner… without Michel, then and now, the sonic landscape would sound very di!erent. His own productions in that time have joined the dots between sleek and stripped back techno, groove laden minimal and more propulsive tech house. Labels to have released these sounds include EC Records, Circle Music, DFTD as well as Noir and Bedrock Records, with in-the-know DJ’s always play his records all over the world. So too does the man himself tour the world, regularly playing top clubs and festivals like Womb, Japan, Circo Loco and Space in Ibiza, Weekend in Berlin, Mysteryland USA and many others across Europe and the Middle East. Given Michel’s ability to thread together so many styles and sounds on dance""oors everywhere (he is widely schooled in playing small, sweaty and intimate gigs as much as he is large festivals) it’s no wonder he has mixed many compilation CDs in his time. We are talking about CDs like No Nonsense, Technological Elements, Impulz, Dance Valley on Ibiza and many more. From funky house to big rolling techno via everything in between, de Hey can do it all. In the meantime, mr. HEY! has been very busy in the studio. This year, next to a super strong release on his own HEY!records, he has also had some bangers on the mighty Bedrock and Defected Digital Records! Multiple songs of the Julienzzz/Gibsome EP, as well as the Seven EP, have reached Beatport’s top 100’s listings. Apart from the releases, Michel’s brought a new concept to life. This extra club night is called Kweekvijver (literally translated: breeding ground) and it’s exactly what the title says. For the last 20 years he’s always been on the look-out for fresh talent, resulting in several successful remixand djcompetitions. So why not make 1 touring clubnight of this idea? The Kweekvijver was born! The parties have been packed and some great new djtalent has reached the surface. Those new dj’ing heroes will return as warm up to the regular HEY! clubnights, that continues to bring the crème de la crème of the underground scene to key Dutch clubs like Amsterdam’s Studio 80, Rotterdam's TOFFLER . From Catz ' n Dogz till Karotte, from Danny Daze to Ricardo Villalobos back to Paul Kalkbrenner; they all have performed on one the nights or festival areas which HEY! has been hosting.

He produced several electronic music styles, his alias for Hardstyle is DJ Adaro. Since he first heard the sounds of Thunderball’s “Bonzai Channel One” in 1993, he was hooked! He got a feeling that he’d never felt before, he immediately fell in love with that hard beat. He loved to watch his heroes behind the wheels of steel, he went to lots of big raves and clubs the following years. He started spinning with some friends and collecting lots of great vinyl. He wanted to create music too, so around the year 2000 he started producing all kinds of electronic music. In 2008 he started producing hardstyle together with his good friend Ran-D, and early 2009 this resulted in their first release on A² Records; “Ran-D vs Adaro – My Name is Hardstyle”. In 2009 he played at the Q-Base festival in Germany. Their track “Ran-D & Adaro – Under Attack” is considered as one of the most popular hardstyle tracks from 2010 (#2 in the Hardtraxx Top of 2010). Their other tracks like ”Struggle for Existence” and their bootleg remix of “In for the Kill” were heavily supported by all major jocks. His solotracks “The Haunter of the Dark”, “Hit you with that Bang Shit” and “No Time to Sleep” are supported by the biggest names in the scene and more is to come! The first two tracks appeared on the long awaited A² Records album ""Unleashed"".  Last year Adaro played on festivals like Defqon.1, The Qontinent, Dreamfields and Q-Base.  In the summer of 2011 Ran-D and Adaro started their official collaboration with their new project “Gunz for Hire”. They made a big impression in the hardstyle scene and events like Decibel Outdoor, Thrillogy and Qlimax are already on their schedule. Last year they produced tracks like “Gangsters Don’t Dance”, “Put it On”, “Sorrow” and “Kings of the Underground”.

He became acquainted with a next-door neighbours studio and it was not too long until he was tweaking the Distortions, Drum Machines and Synthesizers. At the age of 10 B-Front was ready to go out on his own and he started to produce his own records, at this stage Hardstyle wasn’t around so B-Front got by with Trance music.  Fast-forward a couple of years later and B-Front was signed to his first of many labels “DJS Records”. His first release at the age of 15 “Motherfucking Psycho/Jumpin” was supported by all the top artist and sold world wide. In 2006 it was that finally things started to fall in place. The track “Lunatick” was a hit in the charts and gave B-Front a lot of exposure and eventually led to playing the worlds biggest outdoor festival in 2008 “Defqon 1”. From here on in B-Front was on a mission, he wasn’t going to stop until he had reached the top.

Two friends since high school, both with a great passion for music, started their musical career both in their own way. Rick began to produce mostly trance and Hardtrance music at the age of 17. Roland had a passion for the turntables and became a DJ at that age. In the beginning he played multiple styles from trance, Hardtrance till Hardstyle, and a few years later he started to focus especially on the harder styles. He also started to produce music by himself from that moment.  In the meanwhile Rick also began to produce more Hardstyle and that was the point where the cooperation really started. They both shared a passion for uplifting melodies combined with hard and rough sounds, and made some tracks with this formula. They began to realise that they made a perfect team, because they both had their own specialties that worked out very well together. From that point it only became better. They put some tracks on the internet, and by accident it was found by some people who where very excited about it. After a lot of great and positive responses they were approached by [Invalid Artist] to do a cooperation, and that’s the point where this great adventure started.  After a very successful first release together with Brainkicker at [Invalid Label] with ""Fight The Future / Ring That Shit"" they went back into the studio for a solo project and a few months later a new release was born, ""Indeep / The Cube"". This was their real breakthrough in the scene.  Nowadays they’re performing as well national as international and there will be a lot more pounding and promising releases in the near future.

Code Black has played events such as Defqon.1, Qlimax, Mysteryland, Tomorrowland, HardBass and Decibel, being estimated as one of the greatest talents Hardstyle has to offer. Lately, tracks like 'Can't Hold Me Back' and 'Brighter Day' have confirmed the outstanding skills of Code Black as one of the top Hardstyle producers. His stage presence and fresh musical ideas are contributing to his status, being well respected among colleagues and supported by a fast growing worldwide fan base. Go where it's happening...Code Black (Corey Soljan) acknowledged that his future as a Hardstyle producer wouldn't be in his hometown Sydney, so he relocated to the forefront of Hardstyle, the Netherlands. Originally moving in the beginning of 2011 as the duo 'Bioweapon' and later forming his solo act 'Code Black' by the end of 2011. Within the first months of his career he already struck gold with a hit which would place his name directly in the spotlight. ""Red Planet"" burst his name on to the scene with huge impact; the melody could be heard by thousands singing along in perfect harmony, no matter where it was played...from the Gelredome for Qlimax and Hardbass with up to 30,000 people, to the clubs and biggest summer festivals throughout the year, the crowd showed the proof that this was a hit and they loved it!  Summer 2012 came with another big success for Code Black, yet another hit with his dance floor smasher 'Can't Hold Me Back'.  The track gained massive support from so many of the top DJ's and producers and has been played numerous times at every festival throughout the summer. 'Can't Hold Me Back' was named at the end of the year by 'Headhunterz' as his favorite track of 2012 and will forever be a memory of the 'summer-anthem of 2012'. 'Brighter Day' is yet another masterpiece and is already a huge success of 2013, gaining massive support from his colleges and being picked up by day-time dutch radio station SLAM-FM for their TOP40 playlist, reaching a peak of number 8 in the TOP40 chart after 8 weeks!  Code Black succeeds in combining epic melodies with raw edgy production and an overall awe-inspiring atmosphere to his tracks. It's the result of his talent and perseverance to be unique with his music, as well as a sensitive understanding on how to perform in a live environment and balance his sets that get’s the crowds moving.

The creation of his successful label Dirty Workz was a huge step in this young man's carreer, allowing him to take his music beyond even his own expectations and also giving new talents within the Hard Dance scene a respectable platform to launch new and exciting sounds into the scene. By the age of 24, Coone was able to lay down an almost impossible feat; completely selling out one of Belgium's largest venues with over 10.000 Hard Dance fans for an exclusive event - Coone & the Gang. The event has certainly become one of Coone's most memorable moments, a clear pillar in his life which marked the beginning of big things to come and completely opened the Hard Dance scene in Belgium, boosted by national tv and media coverage. As collaborations with some of Hardstyle's biggest names rolled in, Coone was able to impress the world with his unique sound within Hardstyle, imprinting a distinct signature sound into his productions. His experience has lead him towards a new ""Challenge""; to create an album in 30 days including collaborations with some of the Hard Dance scene's superstars. The album was met with great support in the scene, catapulting Coone to new heights. Coone's success within Europe has opened up many doors for him as his eyes are fixed on the horizon, towards the international Hardstyle scene in countries such as Australia and the United States. Without a doubt, Coone lives and breathes Hardstyle. His passion shared by thousands of like-minded souls all over the world, each speaking a universal language. Music.

In 2003 Luna came fourth in the Top 100 of best dj’s in the world during the Dutch Dance Awards, overtaking big shots like Carl Cox, Dave Clarke and Sven Väth. A year later he even moved to the second place. This shows that Richard made the most of his talents and reached the top in no time. “It was quite bizarre to end second in the list behind Tiësto and the ultimate prove that I was on the right track. ” Luna was born in Den Haag and at the age of 3 moved to Sassenheim where he spent the first 21 years of his life, and currently lives in Den Haag. Shortly before the turn of the millennium he came in contact with Q-dance, the world’s leading dance-organisation for the harder styles of dance. Q-dance offered Luna an opportunity to play to the masses at events including Qlubtempo, Qlimax, HouseQlassics and Mysteryland. One time, when his fellow dj Pavo was unable to spin, Richard just picked up the phone and called to ask whether he could perhaps stand in for him. Q-dance had already heard a very promising demo of Luna and therefore let him fill in the vacancy left by Pavo at The 1991/1992 Golden Edition. ‘I like working with a quality organisation as Q-dance, although I do want to stress that I’m an independent dj and that I spin wherever I’m asked to spin’, Lunaexplains. After some very successful performances at events like Houseqlassics, Qlubtempo, Mysteryland, Qlimax, etc. It soon became clear that Luna is an up-and-coming star, which is due to his unique talent to combine his impeccable track selection, his excellent technique, such as backspinning and scratching, and his energy and enthusiasm behind the turntables. It was as early as the mid-nineties that the music lover Luna acquired a passion for hardcore and oldschool, which explains why he is later to become one of the icons of hardstyle. As a rave fanatic and a devotee of harddance, Luna bought himself two turntables and to master the art of dj-ing back in 1994. ‘Hardcore and oldschool are both loves that will never rust and I decided to play those styles more often in the future. ’ Some highlights include superb performances at Qlimax, Sensation Black, and Shockers, where he had to fill the gap between techno-stars Speedy J and DJ Rush and truly rocked the house all night with a combination of Hardstyle and Techno. Lately Luna explores his deep passion for techno – and hardtechno in particulair – with blistering sets at Rotterdam’s Nighttown where he blew off the roof completely. ‘I just hate that typical Dutch way of thinking that now that I’m labelled a hardstyle-dj should keep away from other styles. That’s why I’m not afraid to just sometimes spin a popular techno or hardtrance-track. But I absolutely do love to spin loud and bangin’ techno for a few hours as well’, Luna explains. Now that Richard has established himself as a DJ he spends more and more time in the studio alone or with his partners Trilok and Chiren, who as a threesome go by the name of DHHD. Together they produce tracks for StraightOn Recordings, a label which is co-owned by Luna himself and his friends dj Pila & The scientist. They started up the label in 2003. Richard has released several successful tracks, including ‘So Many More’/The Anthem, ‘We Control The Sound’/’Hear Me Now’, ‘Rush’/’Funky Shit’, and ‘The shockers Theme In Control’, which were released on Id&T ? Q-Dance records and StraightOn Recordings. Besides producing tracks he co-produced and mixed the mix-albums such as ‘Qlimax’, ‘X-qlusive Holland, ‘X-qlusive Luna’ and ‘ Hardbass’. ‘It is my ambition to expand my label, to concentrate on my international career and to further establish my reputation as both a DJ and a producer’. In addition of the succesful X-Qlusive Luna party Luna reached an absolute milestone doing a Luna One Man Show in the massive Geldredome stadium Arnhem in 2005. He was the second dance-artist after Tiësto who played in such a huge arena. And especially for this occasion he produced the pounding themesong ‘Now’s The Time’. That year Luna also did Sensation Black for the third time and played major events like DefQon, Mysteryland, In Qontrol and Impulz. A main part of the summerseaon he spent abroad performing in countries like Greece, Poland, Spain, Germany, Italy, South-Africa, Australia and Estland. At the end of 2006 Luna stopped with StraightOn Recordings. It was time for a change. In 2008 he started the label Minus Is More. The goal is to bring a different sound. Besides his own productions, new talent also gets the chance to release their tracks. The label has grown to be one of the main players in the scene. In the near future the planning is to do worldwide label tour. So keep your eyes open.

Fast, driven by pure energy and harder than the rest, or as he calls it: “party in een zaagjas.” Though impossible to translate, everyone who has ever witnessed a DJ set by Partyraiser knows exactly what that means. Wesley van Swol was born in Delft in 1977 and grew up in the village of Wateringen. While visiting hardcore parties at legendary venues like the Energiehal and Sporthallen Zuid as a young spirit in the early 1990s, he encountered a magical thing that caught his attention and enthusiasm: the craft of working the turntables, like the heroes he saw rocking at these raves. In 1993, a friend taught him the initial tricks of the trade, after which a period of intensive practicing followed for Wesley. When that same friend checked in with him half a year later, he was knocked off his feet by the skills that his buddy had developed in such a short amount of time. This had to be his calling, and so he continued. His new addiction didn’t go unnoticed by his family. One day his mother asked him to come upstairs, where she had installed a new pair of Pioneer Technics SL-MK turntables, a mixer and the rest of the package a DJ needs to kick start what would eventually become the success it is now. In 1995, Wesley started playing at parties in the region and ‘Partyraiser’ came to existence. In an era without internet, one had to meet fellow DJs at parties or through others. And this is exactly how he met Bart Revier, soon baptized Distroyer. Together, Partyraiser and Distroyer experimented with FastTracker 2, resulting in their first tracks. They proceeded by spinning at small events together and had a show at Delta Radio FM90.9, the station that was brought back to life by Partyraiser and DJ D-Angelo. At a party where they blasted their fresh creations through the speakers, they met Vincent Heijnen from Dutch Gabber Network Records, who was interested in their music. This resulted in their first vinyl release called “A New World Order,” including the track “Kick Da Ballistic,” chosen as tune of the year 1997 by none less that Lady Dana and DJ Paul in ID&T Magazine. The train started rolling when George Ruseler from Rige Entertainment, better known as DJ Distortion, called and asked if they would be interested in playing at Megarave on New Year’s Eve 1998 in the Energiehal, on top which they got the opportunity to play at Hardcore & Rave Megamarket at that same venue in April 1998 as a warm-up. This was already a dream starting to unfold itself. However, not long after that big performance, Wesley and Bart split up to follow their own paths into the future. The search for a musical identity began for Partyraiser, making his way through different styles and genres, until in 2001 he was asked to play his old banging style again. From that moment on, the real journey commenced. Partyraiser started hosting his own concept called Doomsday, which brought him into contact with the big shots of the scene and began spinning outside the province, even gaining popularity in Germany. At a booking in The Netherlands, he met William Jordens, who operated as DJ The Rapist and introduced Partyraiser to Multigroove boss Ilja Reiman, the man who would become a key figure in Partyraiser’s career. Ilja, who guided artists like Lady Dana, Pavo and Flamman & Abraxas towards success, now had his eye on Partyraiser. It was also the time when he impulsively laid the foundation for his own signature style by playing a set consisting of hard-edged B-sides at Nosferatu’s Birthday Party. When people starting speaking about ‘Partyraiser style,’ he knew that he had something valuable in hand; a statement was made. One of the first major fruits from his cooperation with Multigroove was playing mainstage at Hellbound in October 2004 in a battle with D-Passion. Opening with “Zij Gelooft In Mij” by the recently passed away André Hazes, followed by a no-nonsense wave of kicks, including his monster hit “Assasins”, these two came in like hurricane. This point can be marked as the real breakthrough of Partyraiser, who grabbed hold of the hardcore scene, never to release it. The phenomenon Partyraiser would forever be mentioned in the same breath with hard, fast and accessible hardcore. In the years that followed, Partyraiser’s weekends were filled with gigs all across the country, including Dominator, Project Hardcore and the 2005 edition of Thunderdome, where his set was introduced by Drokz and MC Da Hustla, giving birth to the well-known line “When I say Party, you say Raiser,” echoing from thousands of throats on that memorable night. And as a confirmation of his achievements, Partyraiser was nominated for Best Hardcore DJ in 2005. The next year included highlights like Masters of Hardcore, In Qontrol, Flockers at the enormous Gelredome and violently closing down the Black area at Defqon.1 Festival. Together with Scrape Face, he scored a huge hit with the track “Harder Dan De Rest,” released on Megarave Records. It was also the year of his first One Man // Half Machine project, celebrating his 12½ years anniversary as a DJ and presenting a robotized spectacle never seen before. The second episode of this kickass concept took place in 2007 and in that same year Partyraiser delivered the icing on the cake with Machine City in Ahoy, marking him as the only hardcore DJ ever to host a concept in this majestic venue. The Dutch borders opened wider than ever before for Partyraiser and he spread his virus across Europe, boosting his name through the roof. In 2007, Partyraiser became a part of Make You Dance Bookings, whereas in October 2008 he joined forces with Platinum Agency, with whom he has been cooperating to this day and became the most frequently booked hardcore DJ. From this solid platform, Partyraiser traveled to all corners of the planet and invaded more mainstages than a seven year old can count to. In 2008, Partyraiser was part of the FFWD Dance Parade in Rotterdam once again, and with his engine running on full throttle, he brought the mayhem to events like Harmony of Hardcore, Ground Zero, Q-BASE and Thunderdome in 2009, adding even more fuel in 2010 by rocking the decks at Masters of Hardcore, In Qontrol, Defqon.1 Festival, Dominator and The Qontinent. Moreover, the first edition of BKJN versus Partyraiser saw the light, becoming a returning tradition where Partyraiser invites his friends and colleagues to deliver hardcore at its finest, even taking this standard sold out concept to Germany and Switzerland. The year 2011 held another peak for the uptempo legend as he had the honor to close the main area at Reverze in Belgium, as well as a performance at Hardline 77 in Moscow and playing at the world’s biggest street parade when it comes to electronic music: Street Parade Zürich. It is a hard and long way to reach the top, but it is even harder to stay there. And this man proved that he will definitely not fall down. The years 2012 and 2013 formed yet another period of triumph for Partyraiser with performances at Dutch events like Hardshock Festival, Decibel Outdoor Festival, Ghosttown and the final edition of Thunderdome, but also with international invasions at Ibiza Goes Hard, including what was undoubtedly the hardest boat party in history, and Defqon.1 Festival Australia all the way on the other side of the world. 2013 was also the year that Partyraiser started focusing on a new experience by launching a series of solo performances in Holland and Germany, adding Italy a year later. Multiple hours of non-stop Partyraiser madness, what more could you wish for? The biggest highlight came in October 2013 when Partyraiser was chosen to host his own area at Thrillogy in the Jaarbeurs Utrecht, next to Frontliner and Adaro. He invited friends, colleagues and personal heroes like Paul Elstak, Nosferatu, Tieum, F. NoIze and Drokz to celebrate this loud and special occasion with him. Thrillogy sold out for the first time and this crown on his career has left a deep and lasting impression.  In the Summer of 2013, Partyraiser founded his own record label, Partyraiser Records. A platform for his musical output, yet also for new talented producers who deserve a chance in the spotlight. While the hardcore sound is moving and developing, getting slower on one side, Partyraiser thrives to push it to the hardest edge on the other side. Because as we all know: hardcore has to ram you right in the chest and shouldn’t rub your back smoothly. From the man himself, tracks like “Our Power” (with Darkcontroller), “Like An Animal,” “From The Westcoast” and “Crime Partners” (with Darkcontroller) were released on the label, giving a heavy taste of his own sound. A reward came in 2014, when Partyraiser Records was chosen as ‘Best New Hardcore Label’ by HDM Awards in the UK. Also, DJs throughout the hardcore scene started supporting the label by playing its tracks. Apart from the fact that Partyraiser now ran his own record label, he found renewed interest in producing in general. More focus on music, but all meant to keep his DJ sets fresh, original and hard as steel. Cooperating in the studio with fellow noisemaker Drokz resulted in the EP “Who’s The Hardest” that was released on the Masters of Hardcore record label. And there is more to come. This year has already held some major highlights for Partyraiser, including his performance at the famous club Pacha in the Spanish village of La Pineda, making himself the first mainstream hardcore DJ to hit this venue with distorted kicks. Furthermore, Partyraiser rocked the mainstages of Masters of Hardcore, Hardshock Festival and Together We Are Hardcore. Outside the country, among other events, he made his way to Germany for Mayday and to Sweden for the Monday Bar. At the moment, Partyraiser spins more outside than within the country and travels great numbers of air miles, making him a Gold Member of the KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, just to give you an idea. A new challenge for Partyraiser was the creation of the anthem for Harmony of Hardcore, which he produced together with F. Noize, including vocals by MC Syco and his American friend El Niño. The anthem, released on Partyraiser Records, captures the ultimate hardcore feeling with its destructive kicks and great atmosphere. With the summer of 2014 in full motion, there are a number of big events on the doorstep. Defqon.1 Festival will be the place where Partyraiser and his partner in crime, Drokz, will team up to destroy the Black stage, whereas the Dominator mainstage is also on this man’s hit list. Another upcoming milestone is the iconic Tomorrowland, where Partyraiser will be representing the edge of hardcore at the Q-dance stage on both weekends. And as if it wasn’t enough, Partyraiser will be returning to party island Ibiza during Ibiza Goes Hard and will be playing twice at Decibel Outdoor Festival.  After ten years of sitting in the front seat of a mad rollercoaster at full speed, the end of the ride is not yet in sight. Stronger than ever, still harder than the rest and 100% mayhem at every set he plays. Can you handle the heat of a raging BPM attack? Try to keep up with the beats of Partyraiser!",http://djpartyraiser.com/,Hardcore,Netherlands,Dutch,Wesley van Swol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Megarave,Partyraiser,,,partyraiser/296236,https://www.facebook.com/PartyraiserOfficial,,partyraiser/id281733358?ign-mpt=uo%3D4,Partyraiser,partyraiser/,982:Partyraiser,3092891-partyraiser,partyraiserofficial,39cgo5SPJygKIlIcrwkd73,@Partyraiser_,officialpartyraiser

The duo are among the top ‘Hardstyle’ purveyors across the Atlantic and are increasingly popular worldwide, thanks to their unique and hard-hitting take on the sub-genre of EDM that shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. “We’re pretty mainstream with a little raw edge on the top of it,” explains Wietse regarding Psyko Punkz’s explosive sound that has won over countless fans since they first burst onto the scene in 2008. “It’s been pretty crazy, but great,” the producer adds regarding the rise of the duo worldwide. Few could have anticipated what was in store for the Dutch duo when the two first met by chance at a party and discovered that they shared a mutual love and appreciation for electronic music, and more specifically, the Hardstyle genre. Upon joining forces, the two were quickly signed to the Belgian label, Dirty Workz, and they began performing live DJ sets at some of the largest and most well-known events in the EU, including Tomorrowland (where they will play for the fourth year in a row this summer), Qlimax, Hardbass, Decibel, Defqon.1 (NL and AUS) and Germany’s Nature One.  Truly Hardstyle in sound, image and lifestyle, Psyko Punkz’s reputation for energetic live sets has even won them shows far away from Europe, including stops across the U.S., Australia, Korea and the United Kingdom. “Our performance is always really energetic,” says Wietse, who calls Utrecht home. “Things can get crazy,” the Dutchman laughs regarding the growing and loyal fan base that turns up at live gigs, and outside observers have noticed just how many fans have latched onto the twosome, over the past three years especially. Tracks such as their “Psyko Foundation” and “Bass Boom” have won them an actual army of followers, nicknamed Psyko Soldiers. “Our fans are really dedicated….we have loads of fans with Psyko Punkz tattoos” adds Wietse.",http://www.psykopunkz.com/,"Hard Dance, Techno, Trance","Utrecht, Netherlands",Dutch,Wietse Amersfoort,Sven Sieperda,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dirty Workz, Be Yourself Music",,,,psyko-punkz/94877,https://www.facebook.com/psykopunkz,psykopunkz,psyko-punkz/id306328481,Psyko+Punkz,psyko-punkz/,48035:Psyko-Punkz,2821866-psyko-punkz,psykopunkz,18pYFSeMi7sOL6nGMICHtS,@psykopunkz,psykopunkz

Pontuz was already into the hardstyle but for Jon this was something new and interesting. Wasted Penguinz was born sometime during 2008. As they were improving their productions together, they got more knowledge of the hardstyle music itself. In 2009 the time had come to take the next step. Sending some of their tracks to various labels they got an answer from a smaller label called Bazz Implant Recordings. Their first release called ‘A Next Generation’ was a fact and got picked up by the bigger names in the scene. Not long after, the biggest hardstyle label in the world, Scantraxx Recordz, recognized their talent and signed the Wasted Penguinz. In 2010 the first two Wasted Penguinz were released on Scantraxx Silver 015 ‘Anxiety’ and ‘I’m Free’ where released. Their upcoming release ‘Hate Mondayz’ and ‘Resistance’ is about to be released on Scantraxx Silver 019. Their main focus is to bring you some high quality releases and let the world become infected by the Wasted Penguinz sound.

Born in 1983 as Joram Metekohy in the small Dutch village of Veenendaal the artist known as Wildstylez knows what hardstyle can do. When he discovered Hardstyle in the early Noughties, an energetic, fraternizing genre that can be brought in different guises. And maybe it’s the different bands he performed in, or just his preference for songs with vocals –but soon Wildstylez is there to present his own brand of Hardstyle. With Hardstyle becoming more and more influential everywhere, including the burgeoning EDM scene in the US, Wildstylez seems like the designated artist to keep building new bridges between Hardstyle and the other genre’s of music. Nevertheless Wildstylez is an artist with both feet firmly on the ground, remaining loyal to Hardstyle itself whilst working with an open mind, conquering the world in his own special unique way.",http://www.wildstylez.com/,Hardstyle,"Veenendaal, Netherlands",Dutch,Joram Metekohy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Be Yourself Music, Scantraxx Recordz",Wildstylez,,,wildstylez/83173,https://www.facebook.com/WILDSTYLEZ,wildstylez,wildstylez/id411671099?ign-mpt=uo%3D4,Wildstylez,wildstylez/,38753:Wildstylez,2560081-wildstylez,wildstylez,0wr85NuJuAYZsRzP1lJgiV,@Wildstyleznl,wildstyleznl

Before he started his revolution, Zatox was already responsible for a sensational series of hit records also with the alias ""Wild Motherfuckers"" with DJ Tatanka. Their ""Fothermucker"" became an unofficial anthem for the edition of Defqon.1 Festival 2007, but it was the anthem of Hard Bass 2011 that made the duo, a trademark of quality, creativity and energy, also demonstrated by the tracks “Wildest” and “We Don’t Care (President mix)”. Two other excellent business cards for Zatox are undoubtedly his mega hit ""My Life"" and his own hosting at Thrillogy 2012, where we saw him star for a whole night. This led to launching his own label ""Unite Records” in 2013, proof that Italian Power still rules the international hardstyle scene. Gradually building his imperium, he reached a summit where he realized that it was the right moment to translate his talents into an album: on the 14th of November, a ‘NEW WORLD ORDER’ will take over; a movement bound to change the landscape of the harder styles forever. Calling out to all revolution-minded souls to break with consumerism, disregard the media and to look forward. On ‘NEW WORLD ORDER’, ZATOX showcases the versatility that he stands for as a producer, mastering both the craft of the melody and the raw kick. Next to a number of smashing solo tracks and remixes, the two discs include a lot of fresh and unique collaborations like ""Back In The Days"" with Brennan Heart, ""Violent"" with Mad Dog and ""Extreme"" with Dave Revan.

Alvaro, also known as Jasper Helderman (1987), grew up in the Netherlands. Discovering his passion for DJ’ing while filming on festivals, he quickly went from editing aftermovies to producing tracks. With most of his time spend in the studio, it didn’t take long before his dazzling career took off. Dedication burns strong as the music flows, so it isn’t surprising Alvaro has a lot of killer productions on his name. Releases as 'Welcome to the Jungle' on Hardwell's Revealed Recordings, 'The Underground' on Spinnin' Records and more recent 'Guest List' on Tiësto's label Musical Freedom, all ended up in the top 5 of the Beatport top 100. His unique style and characteristic sound makes his fan-base grow day by day. But not only the fans love his music, as he has gained both the attention and respect from the music industry. Tiësto, David Guetta, Afrojack, Martin Garrix, Hardwell, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Nicky Romero, Zedd, Lil Jon and Diplo – you name them.

He quickly discovered his passion for music and when he became a teenager, he conquered the Dutch hip-hop scene with his buddy Soundsofficial. Together they formed the duo J&A and performed on stages nationwide. After one of those performances, JPack was approached by a talent scout who arranged for him to be Master of Ceremony (MC) at several dance parties. JPack’s unique style was picked up immediately by party organizers, DJ’s and ofcourse; party people. As a Master of Ceremony, JPack MC differs himself from other MC’s by having a great sense of humor, participating and interacting with the audience and by adding an energetic and positive vibe to the party. He is always up to date knowing the hottest tracks, mashups and bootlegs by heart and he has one of those defining qualities a great MC must have; he knows when to shut up. Since his first performances in Holland as a Master of Ceremony, he has traveled the world to perform with artists like Nicky Romero, Quintino, Don Diablo, Hardwell and Bingoplayers.JPack MC also holds a residency at the famous Club Red in Leeuwarden, Holland and he has started touring with one of Holland’s finest DJ’s: Punish. JPack MC is without a doubt a man who was born to be a performer. His great voice, his nice attitude and his ability to read and control the crowd make him the favorite MC for most people that have seen him on stage.

He developed to be a very versatile artist, whose also a vocalist, singer and songwriter, next to being a very successful MC. Already at a young age, inspired by his father, KC Jones started with training his vocals and developing his skills. He started evolving more and more his own sound as a vocalist and a singer. As he grew older he came across some Masters of Ceremony, and felt this was the right way to go. All his skills as a vocalist and a singer fell together; setting the stage for KC Jones to become the MC he is today. Nowadays KC Jones has transformed into a true MC, always infallible with his timing. He has the skill to know when to hype up the crowd, but also the impeccable understanding that sometimes it’s better to say nothing. Nothing says it better than this quote by MC Creed: “You can teach lyrics and catchy phrases. But the difficulty in finding the balance is knowing when to shut up and let the music do the talking.”Big names in the scene, such as Alvaro, Punish, Gregor Salto, Franky Rizardo and Bakermat, picked up his talent. Soon enough KC Jones was MC’ing at many different stages all around the world. In January 2013 KC Jones and Alvaro decided to join forces. They teamed up as an act and went straight to the top ever since. Rocking stages all over the world, this team is surely heading for the stars! He took stage on events like Tomorrowland, EDC Las Vegas / New York, Beyond Wonderland, WMC poolparties & lots of other stages.

Vraag Domien naar de drie dingen die hij het liefst doet in het leven en dit is zijn antwoord. Al op jonge leeftijd droomt hij ervan zijn geluid de ether in te sturen. Domien: ‘Toen elk ander 13-jarig jongetje natte dromen had, fantaseerde ik over de knoppen en schuiven van een mixer’. Na schooltijd brengt Domien uren door op zijn slaapkamertje waar hij jingles opneemt met een bandrecorder. Na jaren geoefend te hebben bij verschillende internetzenders ziet een oplettende surfer met radioconnecties muziek in Domien en mag hij aan de slag bij een lokaal radiostation in Eindhoven. Na twee jaar houdt hij het voor gezien in de lichtstad en gaat Domien aan het werk bij het radiostation van Rob Stenders: KXRadio. Hier krijgt hij een plek op de vrijdagmiddag, om iedereen in jubelstemming het weekend in te sturen. De tijd dat Domien moest fantaseren over mixers, knoppen en schuiven is nu voorgoed voorbij. Tegenwoordig is hij namelijk elke doordeweekse dag ook aan het werk voor BNN. Tot 2014 met zijn programma @Work, waar hij zorgde voor de muzikale afleiding op de werkvloer. Hij zette de ene na de andere doorwerkplaat op en zorgde voor een frisse kijk op de dag. Nu is hij je maatje in de avond! Iedere maandag tot en met donderdag start hij je avond met Dit is Domien.

Through his very first releases he became the architect of tech-trance; a sound that went on to become a fully-fledged electronic music phenomena. Continually modifying and fine-tuning his style ever since, he has gone on to create numerous leading-edge dance classics - ‘Godd’, ‘Indicator’, ‘Echnalava’, ‘More Than A Life Away’ & ‘Coma Aid’ numbered among them. Behind the decks he has smashed nights in all the world’s farthest corners, played a near uncountable number of tent-pole events for the scene’s flagship club & festival brands. As a result of which he has spent the last 7 consecutive years inside the ranks of DJ Magazine’s Top 50. 1998 – 2000: Southside Spinners & The V.ision Series. Marco first made his production presence felt when in 1998, alongside Benjamin Bates and under the name Southside Spinners he dropped ‘Luvstruck’. Though markedly different to the year’s other Dutch trance hits it still proved a near-instant domestic and import smash. Prompting a wave of interest in his name, Marco was quickly signed to Dutch music giant ID&T and in 2000 released his debut single ‘In Charge’. That was followed by Phases 1 & 2 of the V.ision EP series, which spawned the tracks ‘Certainly’ & ‘Indicator’. Originally referred to by DJs as ‘the V.sound’, the three EPs are now considered to be the blueprints of tech-trance, with Marco as the sub-genre’s vanguard & forefather. 2000 – 2002 Innercity Con:Fusion: Running at comparably fast pace to his burgeoning production portfolio, the turn of the millennium saw an explosion in Marco turntable career. Having originally cut his DJ teeth at the age of 17 at the renowned DansSalon spot in Eindhoven, Marco began to play at bigger nights, and to larger crowds. Notable among them was ID&T’s Innercity – the first of Holland’s major indoor arena events - and it was for them that he mixed his first compilation CD. Through the release (which incorporated both house and tougher progressive numbers) Marco began to stand farther apart from the trance sound of his contemporaries.

While dad was a popular DJ throwing house parties in the States and through Eurpope while in the Army, music was his calling since an early age. Before becoming a vocalist, he played the Tenor Saxophone in his middle school band for a few years, until he became introduced to a new music genre called Hip Hop. He knew in his heart that he had found this new love when he first heard Erick B & Rakim's ""Paid in full"". ""I still remember that bus ride with my cousin Jeff from Long Island to Queens and going crazy off the sound of Check out my Melody "" After completing high school in Texas, Ambush joined the Army in order to finance an own Album. After a four year run and being stationed in The Netherlands, he was introduced to a young DJ in the early stages of his career that needed an MC for a show one night. Since that first meeting, Mc Ambush was born and he began to make his mark through Europe along side DJ Chuckie ! Ambush has an incredible talent for freestyling. As the years carried on his skills were enhanced, especially during live shows or sets, which made him stand out next to other artists. Noticing his skills, Chuckie introduced him to some popular live bands in Holland with which Ambush toured the world, entertaining crowds of different ages, ethnicity, and gender. The bands travelled to a series of clubs and festivals across Holland, Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, Tunesia, Taiwan, Japan, Germany, Belgium, Columbia, Spain,St. Martin St. Eustasius, These live bands consisted of various musical styles where the Mc would gain recognition for dropping a rhyme at the drop of a dime at any given moment.(Saskia La Roo Jazz Band, Gerald y la Ritmca , Hans Dulfer Band ).

Marlon, the wild and outspoken half of Bassjackers, lives for the spotlight and being on stage performing for massive crowds. His counterpart, Ralph, on the other hand, is laidback and introverted, preferring his behind-the-scenes role as producer. Their opposing personalities are a perfect combination for this unique one dj-one producer collaboration. The duo exploded onto the scene and in 2011 their dancefloor bomb “Mush Mush” was picked up by Tiësto and released on his label Musical Freedom. The track dominated the Beatport top 10 chart for over two months and was one of the biggest festival tracks of the year. This was a sign of things to come.Since then, Bassjackers have reached massive new heights in their career with numerous chart-topping bangers and hit collaborations with the likes of Martin Garrix, Afrojack, KSHMR, Dyro, R3hab, and Showtek, to name a few, as well as remixes for A-list artists including Rihanna, Enrique Iglesias, Moby, and Ne-Yo.

He's the pride of Moldova, known for his unique and very own sound. He is Andrei Rata, better known as Andrew Rayel. Born on July 21st, 1992, his young age never stopped him from taking the lead amongst the next generation of EDM producers. Developing strong musical skills, he studied orchestral music and kicked off his producing career at only 13 years of age. It didn't take long for the passionate music lover to translate his ideas into sounds. He created a truly unique sonic signature - one of piano power, harmonic balance, and euphoric tales. And so, years later, his originals and remixes are praised by many and loved by more. But, rest assured, the Andrew Rayel story has only just begun. ""Trance was the perfect solution, as it is a combination of melody, harmony and energy, elements that I prefer the most"", says Andrew Rayel. Having Armin van Buuren supporting his tracks on the world famous A State of Trance radio show had always been a dream of Andrew. And sometimes, dreams come true. His tracks '550 Senta', 'How Do I Know' ft. Jano, 'Aeon of Revenge', 'Aether', 'Deflagration', 'Musa' and 'Zeus' all made it to the show, often voted Tune of the Week and Future Favourite. The trance scene embraced Andrew's refreshing sound, giving him a very warm welcome. His tracks found a solid home on the A State of Trance and Armind labels, both part of the Armada Music family. With such impressive originals, it didn't take long until the Rayel sound became hot property for remixes. And so, Andrew was lucky enough to take on remix duties for tracks by Armin van Buuren, Markus Schulz, Tiësto, W&W, Bobina, Tenishia, and many more. Earning the support of the DJ elite, the Rayel sound has spread all across the globe, from underground clubs to mainstream festivals. Though his career is fairly young, Andrew has already DJed the world's most legendary clubs and massive festivals. From Kazantip, Global Gathering, Trancefusion, Ball En Blanc, Trancemission and Ministry of Sound to multiple A State of Trance 600 events, the A State of Trance Ibiza Nights at Privilege and the world-famous Monday Bar Cruise. As a result of his hard work and dedication, fans voted him #28 in the DJ Mag Top 100 of 2013, as the highest climber. Expectations for 2014's poll are even higher. The same goes for the highly anticipated Andrew Rayel debut album. Set for release on Armada Music, trance land eagerly holds its breath, craving more of Andrew's magic dancing dust. Andrew's very first and official compilation: 'Mystery of Aether' came out on Armada Music in early September, 2013. It's Rayel doing what he does best. He moves us. His 2014 collaboration with Armin himeself, 'EIFORYA' is set to take the world by storm. ""I believe music is a universal language that unites people with nothing but love. I intend to make sure that my tracks are all about emotions and happiness. That's what's driving music, making the world a better place"", says Andrew Rayel.",http://andrewrayel.com/,"Trance, Progressive","Chisinau, Moldova",Moldovan,Andrei Rata,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Armada Music Bundles, ARVA",AndrewRayel,,,andrew-rayel/160633,https://www.facebook.com/Andrew.Rayel,andrew_rayel,andrew-rayel/id398302807,Andrew+Rayel,andrew-rayel/,72125:Andrew-Rayel,4564398-andrew-rayel,andrewrayel,1UtBjqMZBAmqIPlDrKu7Tr,@Andrew_Rayel,AndrewRayel

This Sydney sider broke boundaries with his buzz track Achtung!, (which ironically means Attention!) literally standing at attention being played at every major festival from EDC Las Vegas to the mainstages at Tomorrowland. The Winnel profile isn’t shy of an official remix devoir either, lending his skills to Clean Bandit for ‘Real Love’, Peking Duk’s ‘Take Me Over’ and #1 ARIA Club Chart theft with Glover’s ‘Faces’. High accolades from Michael Woods’ and his label Diffused Music have spilled in; Dave Winnel delighting his fellow producer, breaking the mold on his recent drops and officially remixing for the Englishman too. Celebrating raw talent Oliver Helden’s holds true to Dave Winnel, featuring three of his tracks on Heldeep Radio and personally thanking the Australian talent for making such great music. Dave Winnel’s smooth performance method has roped in credit as 2014’s Ministry of Sound ‘Electro House Sessions’ asset charging with affect across the country, boasting electronic stamina and full commitment to the dance floor. It’s Dave’s highly acclaimed shows at Pacha Sydney, Platinum and The Met that are pioneering leaving just enough room for Australia’s hottest festivals Future Music Festival, Stereosonic and Summafieldayze where an electric guest spot from Dave is undeniable. The times ahead call confidently for this young Australian talent, deviating from the norm and bringing the vibe with 2 remixes for Axtone and a slew of releases on ARMADA.

Having established himself as one of the biggest draws in Holland’s house music circuit with a style that works as well on big stages as it does in sweaty clubs, he’s now rapidly expanding his horizons across the world. Releases on OFF, Defected and Spinnin’ demonstrate an increasingly strong production career, while his Flow radio show and events are fast becoming a major part of the house music landscape across the world. “I think that playing a lot of different stages has taught me how to work with a large diversity of crowd, rather than doing one trick every show. I don’t want to be a one-trick pony. I just want to arrive and do my set specifically for that night.” It speaks volumes about his appeal and ambition that he’s as at home playing with long-time friend Hardwell as he is playing alongside house music legends like MK and Dennis Ferrer.  A decision to dedicate himself to the modern deep house sound in recent times stemmed from a desire to stop his style from snowballing to the OTT builds and drops that his main stage and big room performances were pressuring him towards. ""I was performing on the big stages and I thought, I’m really enjoying the big crowd, but I’m really not enjoying being pressured towards a certain sound. So I thought to myself - how can i bring my house sound to these crowds?""",http://www.frankyrizardo.com/,"House, Minimal, Tech House","Arnhem, Netherlands",Dutch,Frank Ketelaar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Defected Records, LTF Records",FrankyRizardo,,,franky-rizardo/34714,https://www.facebook.com/FrankyRizardo,frankyrizardo,franky-rizardo/id212264439?ign-mpt=uo%3D4,Franky+Rizardo,franky-rizardo/,30284:Franky-Rizardo,1195621-franky-rizardo,frankyrizardo,2UgphhGSlC9QWgaZWUOCkl,@FrankyRizardo,RizardoTV

Throughout early childhood he aspired to be a drummer, but at the tender age of 15 Jordy scored his first residency in his hometown. He expanded by gigging around in local clubs and bars and got a job in one of Holland’s few independent vinyl record stores. Here he would master his craft through day-to-day analysis of the progressions and trends in electronic music. Additionally, he would make recommendations to then regular customers such as Sander van Doorn, Fedde Le Grand and Marco V. It was only a matter of time before he started producing music of his own. Early releases such as Lump, OMG, Claymore, Bitsize and Torpedo set the foundation and defined his studio prowess. His music has seen huge support from the likes of Tiësto, Calvin Harris, Armin van Buuren, Avicii, Knife Party, David Guetta, the former Swedish House Mafia, Hardwell and a long list of others. While he has earned his stripes with his peers his collaboration list continues grow with collaborations alongside Bassjackers, Dannic, Mightyfools, Cobra Effect, Fafaq and more. Over the years Jordy has released music with Hardwell’s Revealed Recordings, Bingo Players’ Hysteria and Sander van Doorn’s DOORN Records, in total racking up 5 Beatport Top 10’s. He has built quite a musical arsenal for himself and his peers. Between recent remixes for Tiësto, NERVO, and Cash Cash, his highly supported bootlegs of Iggy Azalea, U2, Jay-Z and Justin Timberlake or the 30 plus free Dazz Up (mashup edits) he has given away with wavo.me, there is no shortage of Jordy Dazz music. A lot of it can be heard first on his Dope & Dirty Podcast available on SlamFM, iTunes and through the DJ List. There is no slowing down in 2015 so far Disco Nights has come out on Revealed Recordings, The Limit on Fly Eye and much more in the works. His style, character and break neck energy have not gone wasted within his personal reign upon the club floor and dance world. Performances around the world in the legendary Zouk Singapore, Privilege, Amnesia and Ushuaia in Ibiza, Webster Hall in NYC, Temple in San Francisco and the Heineken Music Hall in Holland help muster considerable belief across the globe in his unique, yet coherent fusion of rhythmic electro and peak time house music. A self made maestro on all accounts with the considerable benefit of some heavyweight industry support along the way, the road ahead looks promising for Jordy Dazz and his vision for peak time perfection outside of the universal comfort zone.",http://www.jordydazz.com/,"Trance, Progressive House, Electro House","Eindhoven, Netherlands",Dutch,Jordy van Oostveen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Revealed Recordings, Vicious, ARVA",JordyDazz,,,jordy-dazz/248590,https://www.facebook.com/JordyDazz,jordydazz,jordy-dazz/id504780836,Jordy+Dazz,jordy-dazz/,66528:Jordy-Dazz,5161253-jordy-dazz,jordydazz,1H2OBrGc1V7laMLDwzJWFl,@JordyDazz,JordyDazz

In the 9 years that have followed they’ve continued to pack out the CD wallets of world’s A-list spinners with speaker-spankers that have included ‘Such is Life’, ‘Symfo’ and ‘Life Less Ordinary’… In 2009 they unleashed ‘L.E.D. There Be Light’ - a track that was quickly snapped up by ID&T as the anthem for that year’s Trance Energy event. Their Live and DJ sets induce floor-quakes before thousands of fans at clubs, arenas and festivals every single weekend. They are Piet Bervoets & Benno de Goeij… and they’re Rank 1. Rank 1’s Year One - ‘Airwave’: After a chance introduction at a party in the spring of 1997, Benno & Piet recognised much common musical ground and decided to work together. As the Dutch trance dawn rose up over Europe, the pair found themselves faultlessly positioned at its epicentre to reign. Championed by fellow fast-risers Armin van Buuren, Tiësto and Ferry Corsten, in 1999 the stadium-sized sound of ‘Airwave’ sent out an audio shockwave across the continent. It proved to be such a hit that just 12 months later ‘Airwave’ had been released, incredibly, in over 40 countries – jumping into the Top 10 in the UK and becoming the first Dutch track to top the European Dance Chart. The Rank 1 Singles: Working at the pace of roughly one floor-carnivore a year, Rank 1 followed-up with ‘Such is Life’ (2001), ‘Awakening’ (taken from their debut album ‘Symsonic’ - both 2002), ‘It’s up To You’ (2003), ‘Beats @ Rank-1 Dotcom’ (2004) and ‘Opus’/’Top Gear’ (2005). After a year’s production break they returned to the fray in 07 with two monster collaborations: ‘Life Less Ordinary’ (in tandem with Alex M.O.R.P.H.) and the ‘This World is Watching Me’, co-produced with Armin. In 2009 Rank 1 became the ‘go-to’ men for event anthems, remarkably producing them for not one, but two world-class festivals. In February ‘L.E.D. There Be Light’ became the wildly-popular, Beatport-smash anthem for Trance Energy, while ‘Symfo’ was selected to define Poland’s colossal Sunrise festival. Their latest track The Great Escape (a collaboration with Jochen Miller) has been choosen as theme track for the Polish event 'enTrance' to be held in 2010. The Rank 1 Remixes: Rank 1 also has an estimable remix-o-graphy to their name. Freddie Mercury, Ferry Corsten, Push, Cygnus X, Delirium, Marcel Woods, Mr Sam, Ronald van Gelderen, Angelic and Ayumi Hamasaki have all been given Rank 1’s studio re-touch. Piet the DJ, Benno the Producer: Rank 1 now has two distinct branches to its operation. Benno is in charge of all the Rank 1’s production elements. He co-produced many of the tracks on Armin van Buuren’s 2008 long-player ‘Imagine’ and has already commenced work on the next one. Piet meanwhile takes the role of the globetrotting DJ, spinning at tent-pole events like Dance Valley in his native Holland and numerous international tours (including the US and Australasia) for the likes of Gatecrasher & Godskitchen. In 2009 Rank 1 found themselves re-entering the DJ Magazine Top 100 at No.77. Rank 1 LIVE: Over recent years, Rank 1 has increasingly come together on stage for their Live performances. They became the first live act to perform at Sensation and famously forced the closure of doors of Trance Energy’s main arena (when 25,000 clubbers packed it out to hear them play). Their kinship with the biggest event in trance music is widely-known and they are the only live act to have rocked Trance Energy 3 times! Outside of that Rank 1 has continued to thrill crowds live at some Europe’s best-known festivals including Mystery Land, Sunrise & Nature One. Rank 1 – The Mindset: When it comes to interviews, Benno & Piet are, in essence the ‘Daft Punk’ or trance! Now famously reclusive, they don’t like the term ‘success’ as it implies they have already arrived. Instead, on the few occasions they do speak, they prefer to speak in terms of ‘progression’ & ‘perfection’. Ultimately though they are far happier to let their music do all the talking.",http://www.rank-1.com/,Trance,Netherlands,Dutch,Piet Bervoets,Benno de Goeji,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,High Contrast Recordings,Rank1,,,rank-1/642,https://www.facebook.com/rank1official,,rank-1/id47724800,Rank+1,Rank1/,60:Rank-1,185211-rank-1,rank1official,1eQe86RbDKRIiGZk08r9YJ,@rank1official,rank1tv

Sander van Doorn got in touch with the musical scene in the year of 1995, the Dutchman was sixteen at the time. His brother’s latest gadget, a real ""Groovebox"", caught his attention. He was astounded when he first experienced the amount of creativity that could be put into creating music. Time and time again, Sander would borrow his brother’s Groovebox and his nephew’s vinyl records and he played the life out of those records. Since then, Sander’s heart belonged to music and it still does today. When talking about Sander van Doorn, you must be talking about his music, Sander has created his own typical sound and style. Sander is a producer at heart, and started DJ’ing to create exposure for his productions. It’s basically impossible to put appoint one specific genre to Sander van Doorn’s style, his music gets influenced by a very broad spectrum of factors. Sander lets himself get inspired by in many different ways en supports talent with a love for the music as big as his. Today in 2015, Sander has performed thousands of times in every corner of the world and released several records himself, yet Sander is still part of a group of innovative and progressive artists. Sander’s creative process exists of re-inventing musical styles, taking risks in regards to the sound he creates and most importantly staying ahead of the masses.

The Belgian artist and producer, otherwise known as Jef Martens, remains on the cutting edge of electronic dance music, keeping his eyes on the future at all times and consistently challenging himself and the genre at large. That forward-thinking mentality has been ingrained in his very DNA, and it serves as a creative catalyst for him to this day. Growing up in Belgium, he picked up the piano at three-years-old, eventually studying classical music and composition at the Royal Conservatory of Antwerp thereafter. In the midst of his studies, he also found time to experiment with his DJ father's turntables— a foreshadowing of what was to eventually come for the budding musician. Leaving law school with only one year left until completion, Basto dove headfirst into a career making music.  ""It all went quite naturally,"" he recalls. ""It just felt like something I was always meant to do. I'd been working towards it without necessarily thinking about it for so long. I didn't have a plan. I just made music."" Sharing his stage moniker ""Basto"" with a cat he adopted, the artist dropped his first smash in 2005. ""Rock With You"" topped charts in Belgium and Holland, and it took off at radio. As he continued to release singles, he eventually embraced his more classical inclinations with ""Gregory's Theme"" in 2010. Originally written as a tribute to Hugh Laurie's titular character on House, the song exploded as a worldwide club phenomenon. Soon, the likes of Kylie Minogue, The Wanted, Keane, and Flo Rida sought Basto out for high-profile remixes, while he eventually dropped the mega-hit ""Again and Again"", which currently exceeds 20 million cumulative views on YouTube and occupied Beatport's Top 10 for a month upon release.

Well known for his turntable “skills”, his notoriously rebellious dissolute lifestyle and especially as a dedicated DJ! He was also one of the first and very few DJ’s who gained his well earned status of a real Dutch celebrity! Jean is distinctive and overloaded with multiple awards, such as the SENA Award, an award for most played Club DJ on Dutch radio in the past ten years, he has been voted as BEST CLUB DJ for several times ! On top of that, he recently, late in 2009, received the very prestigious SLAM FM Ouvre Award! There are also numerous nominations at big Award shows like the TMF AWARDS and SILVER STAR DANCE in the UK . and by the way, let’s not forget he is THE MOST BOOKED DJ, ‘EVER’, IN THE NETHERLANDS. His name counts many International classics / anthems as THE LAUNCH and EVERY SINGLE DAY, but also more recent highly successful co-productions as ORIGINAL DUTCH (#1 on dancetunes.nl) and THE BOMB! Jean is the only Dutch DJ who produced over more than 30 compilation CD’s (IT 4 to 9, MADHOUSE 1 to 12), for a total sales both national as international of 500,000 CD’s! Due to this international success, Jean has been spinning records at almost every place in the world! Over 20 countries at numerous festivals and at the most prominent and well known clubs! On the party Island IBIZA he played in all mayor clubs such as Amnesia, Pacha and Privilige. His homebase remains in the Netherlands, where he’s also a very welcome guest at parties varying from 50 to 50,000 people. This high degree of flexibility in terms of locations, price and musicwise interpretation, makes sure his popularity is still that huge in his homeland, that means both with his own as with the latest generation of clubbers! The youngest and last generation’s even call DJ JEAN the founder of the modern house and DJ scene, or GODFATHER OF HOUSE! This almost iconic status is obviously not created “just like that”, we’re talking about a DJ who does not want to be labeled for one particular musical style, but who loves to explore the rich variety of dance movements and always aims for the best during every gig! Whether it’s a grand cafe, a student party, club, festival, erotic or company event, his audience is the most important at any time; With Jean playing, no dancefloor is safe anymore, you better get ready to ROCK!!",www.djjean.com,"House, Electro House, Trance","Amsterdam, Netherlands",Dutch,Jan Engelaar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"PM Music, Play That Music",,,,dj-jean/18462,https://www.facebook.com/DJJEAN,,jean/id50476662,,,artist/20:Jean,,dj-jean,,@DJJeanMusic,djjeanmusic

In 1987, a shrink-wrapped record titled, “Nude Photo,” started appearing on the shelves of a few idiosyncratic dance shops throughout Europe. The techno uprising was underway. The music sounded other-worldly: sub-aquatic basslines raced with hi-hats constructed from welding sparks. It was like listening to the liquid electricity of one man’s soul. A part of the original Detroit “Holy Trinity” with Juan Atkins and Kevin Saunderson, Derrick took the Euro-electropop crystals of Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode and New Order beyond its own horizon, infusing it with house, experimental synthesizer work and just plain soul. Songs and albums like ""Nude Photo"", ""Strings Of Life"", ""It Is What It Is"", ""Beginning"", ""Relics"" and “Icon” run deeper than genre molds can grasp. Referred to as the ""Miles Davis of Techno"", Mr. May has worked with some of the most experimental and creative musical artists in the world, such as ABC, Depeche Mode,Fine Young Cannibals and System 7.",http://www.transmatrecords.com/,"Hi-Tech Soul, Techno","Detroit, United States",American,Derrick May,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"R&S Records, A-Wave Records, Rush Hour",DerrickMay,,,derrick-may/21065,https://www.facebook.com/derrickmayday,derrickmay,derrick-may/id16003135?ign-mpt=uo%3D4,Derrick+May,derrick-may/,660:Derrick-May,101512-derrick-may,derrick-may,0v6N0xV7AfHHKVcgUOjC51,@derrickmay,

By age 15, this prodigy was already DJing at some of the hottest underground clubs in NYC and perfecting his craft as a producer. Junior’s intense passion for music and unrelenting work ethic has allowed the New Jersey native to transform himself from his humble beginnings into one of the most innovative and in-demand DJ/Producers in the industry. Junior Sanchez’s ever-evolving and forward-thinking style has attracted positive attention from artists spanning all genres. Over the course of his career, Junior has produced and remixed material for Madonna, Shakira, Katy Perry, Good Charlotte, Placebo, The Bravery, Daft Punk, Gorillaz, Blaqk Audio, Hot Hot Heat, Roisin Murphy, Felix Da Housecat, The Faint, New Order, Emiliana Torrini, Jamiroquai, Giorgio Moroder, Moving Units, Les Rhythmes Digitales, and countless others. When he is not producing for some of the biggest artists in the industry, Junior focuses on his own massive tracks, recently releasing the Number 1 Beatport chart toppers “Where You Are” and “I Believe In.” As a DJ, he has performed internationally in clubs and festivals throughout the United States, Asia, Australia, and Europe.

While one is often prominent and empowering, the other prefers staying quietly in the background - a fairly high contrast in character. However, there is one significant reason for the phenomenal connection between these two personalities: their passion and love of music. Mid 2010, Thom Jongkind - then operating by the name of Scalix - decided to set up a DJ duo named Blasterjaxx together with another producer at the time. Thom quickly noticed that huge steps were taken in the field of productions and that the range towards their audience was constantly increasing. Nevertheless, the personal chemistry between both producers started decreasing. Thus, it was Thom who focused more and more on music, while the other producer started having other priorities. Shortly after, they mutually agreed on ending their collaboration as a duo and decided that Thom would continue with the Blasterjaxx label. Because Thom believed that Blasterjaxx would only be complete as a duo, he started looking for possibilities of a new, and this time around, perfect collaboration. In the meantime, Thom had been charmed by Idir Makhlaf for a while, who was operating by the name of Macosta. Only after a few collaborations it was already clear how well they hit off; a new Blasterjaxx duo was born with - what subsequently appeared - an unparalleled amount of talent and potential. Together they plan on taking over the world with their unique sound, which is best described as a crossover between electro-house, progressive and big room.",,Electro House,"Den Haag, Netherlands",Dutch,Thom Jongkind,Idir Makhlaf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mixmash Records, Musical Freedom, Smash The House, DirtyDutchMusic, Universal Music, Defected",Blasterjaxx,,,blasterjaxx/154919,https://www.facebook.com/BlasterjaxxOfficial,blasterjaxx,blasterjaxx/id390612080?ign-mpt=uo%3D4,BlasterJaxx,blasterjaxx/,58380:Blasterjaxx,5107583-blasterjaxx,blasterjaxx,37awA8DFCAnCCL7aqYbDnD,@Blasterjaxx,BlasterjaxxTV

The first time Luke was confronted with making electronic music was at a friend's who owned an Amiga computer. He showed Luke that he could make songs with bits and pieces of other songs. It was then that Luke realised he wanted to make his own music. Equipped with only one of the first soundcards in his PC he made his beginner tracks. One day Dobre (Good Men, Trancesetters & Basco) had to dj at Luke's school. Luke went up to Dobre and asked him if he could send him a demo-tape. After sending the tape and getting some feedback from Dobre, Luke bought himself a synthesiser. Dobre and Luke kept in contact and planned midnight sessions at Dobre's studio, listening records. Dobre pointed Luke in the right directions and at the early age of eighteen Luke got his first record deal. Going out to parties inspired Laidback Luke. It was here that he got to know about ""dance floor energy"". Being a house music freak, Luke got influenced by MK, Todd Terry, DJ Pierre and Carl Craig. The urge to search for harder stuff came when he got confronted with Relief Records. He became a real fan of that funky hard Chicago sound.
